Residential, commercial and industrial installations added 129MW of generation capacity in FY25. Sales of rooftop solar panels rose rapidly in FY23-FY24 amid acute power disruptions following Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis, and new attractive feed-in-tariffs (FITs) of around LKR37 a kilowatt hour in 2022. However, FITs have since been cut to around LKR21 a unit, lengthening the payback period and reducing overall consumer savings, as the national grid grapples with rising renewable generation.\n\nExecution Risks in Power Generation: HFL\u2019s plans to construct a 50MW wind power plant and 37 ground-mounted solar power plants with a combined capacity of 149MW, on an alternating current equivalent basis (AC), are subject to execution risk. These projects are contingent on a multitude of approvals from regulators, environmental bodies and local governments, and subject to funding and land acquisition. Commissioning of solar plants and cash flow generation should take a further 90 days on average after power purchase agreements (PPAs) are signed with CEB, while the wind project is likely to be commissioned over 18 months."

Commissioning of solar plants and cash flow generation should take a further 90 days on average after power purchase agreements (PPAs) are signed with CEB, while the wind project is likely to be commissioned over 18 months.\n\nLeverage to Peak on Capex: We forecast EBITDA net leverage to rise to a temporary peak of 9.0x in FY27, from 1.0x in FY25, before falling to about 3.0x by FYE28 as projects generate cash flow. Timely project execution is critical for leverage to normalise within rating sensitivities. HFL plans to invest in significant capex in FY26 and FY27, mainly for power projects, funded almost entirely by debt. It is finalising lender agreements for the wind project, before issuing a construction notice to CEB by February 2026 under the PPA. Local banks mostly finance solar projects, with negotiations at various stages.\n\nInterest Coverage Moderating, but Healthy: Fitch expects HFL\u2019s EBITDA interest coverage to decline to around 3.5x over the medium term (FY25: 6.0x), assuming most power projects are commissioned. Annual interest costs will rise, as interest payments are subject to grace periods during project construction, and interest accrued during construction is capitalised and added to outstanding debt balance."

JAT is the leader in the niche wood coating-market, and is the sole local distributor of The Sherwin-Williams Company (Issuer Default Rating: BBB+/Stable). JAT has smaller EBITDA scale than HFL, but a longer record of steady demand and about 25% of revenue is from overseas. Nonetheless, demand for HFL\u2019s rooftop solar panels surged in 2022-2023 amid severe power shortages during Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis, but conditions have since improved materially. Accordingly, HFL\u2019s rating reflects risks from a slowdown in solar panel sales and execution risks in its power generation projects.\n\nRenewable power producer WindForce PLC (A+(lka)/Stable) is rated at the same level as HFL. WindForce is more established and currently the largest rated renewable player, with capacity of 163MW across wind, solar and hydropower.

The event brought together participants from 16 countries to explore making living wages a reality for all workers in Asia and the Pacific.\n\nThe dialogue heard that despite a steady growth in average wages in Asia and the Pacific, millions of workers, especially women, migrants and those in informal employment continue to struggle with low pay, poor working conditions and rising costs of living.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is a wage that allows workers not just to survive, but to live with dignity \u2014 a living wage. A living wage means being able to put healthy food on the table, afford decent housing, send children to school, and seek medical care when needed,\u201d said ILO Director-General Gilbert F. Houngbo in a video message to the event.\n\nThe inaugural address was delivered by Sri Lanka Labour Minister Prof. Anil Jayantha Fernando.\n\nParticipants stressed that the ILO\u2019s living wage principles\u2014social dialogue, equality, balancing workers\u2019 needs with enterprise and economic realities, addressing root causes of low pay, as well as using evidence-based approaches\u2014are vital for building predictable and effective wage-setting processes to ensure adequate wages."

The repository enhances accessibility, transparency and consistency in wage-setting, and forms part of ILO\u2019s broader efforts to support member states to develop evidence-based wage policies.\n\nFollowing the high-level dialogue, a three-day technical course on effective evidence-based wage policies, including living wages, will be held for Government, employer and worker representatives from across the region.\n\nThe dialogue builds on the ILO\u2019s historic 2024 agreement between governments, employers and workers on the concept of living wages, and the launch of the first global program in 2025 focused on supporting countries to estimate and operationalise living wages.\n\nAccording to the ILO, a living wage enables workers and their families to afford a decent standard of living, covering food, housing, healthcare, education and other essential needs. This differs from minimum wages, which are legally binding wage floors designed to protect workers from unduly low pay but do not automatically guarantee a decent standard of living or provide remuneration sufficient to meet the needs of workers and their families."

I responded immediately. Despite much difficulty, I managed to track the then Honorary Consul down in a country he was taking up residence in. We recalled the many Israel National Days he had invited me to, then taking kindly to the many repeated WhatsApp reminders I sent him, he intervened and through his counterparts in India got her the visa.\n\nI then wondered why I too had not visited this country of resilience and innovation, also since I had heard very inviting reviews from a secretary who worked with me, who visited Jerusalem years ago, and to date, I hold in deep reverence the souvenir she gave me, owing to its profound religious relevance. My mind also goes back four decades to a chance meeting with an Israeli woman in New York, who over many coffees told me that when she and her family left Israel to live in the USA, they had lost their way, and had no option but to take refuge in a Palestinian camp, where they were treated with unusual warmth and hospitality before being accompanied out of the camp site.\n\nGiven my interest in the subject, friends in Sydney gifted me this very readable and insightful \u201cMiddle East Memoir\u201d, a fascinating personal journey through the wonders and dangers of the Middle East, giving context to the devastating war between Israel and Palestinians in Gaza and providing readers with a behind-the-scenes look at the Israeli occupation of the West Bank."

I chose the latter, often building capacity, inter-alia monitoring the domain specific eco system, stepping into stricture an irresponsible player, in the larger public and national interest, imposing fines and penalties, directives for compensation, filing action connected with capital market offences, even resisting political interference which may have otherwise resulted in regulatory forbearance. My point is that at a national or global level there has to be courage to take a stand. If not, the institutions lose relevance and the people lose credibility."

I chose the latter, often building capacity, inter-alia monitoring the domain specific eco system, stepping into stricture an irresponsible player, in the larger public and national interest, imposing fines and penalties, directives for compensation, filing action connected with capital market offences, even resisting political interference which may have otherwise resulted in regulatory forbearance. My point is that at a national or global level there has to be courage to take a stand. If not, the institutions lose relevance and the people lose credibility.\n\n\u201cForgive us, children of Gaza\u201d. \u201cForgive us, brothers and sisters.\u201d\n\nHis words carried the weight of overwhelming loss. More than 65,000 Palestinians killed, including 18,000 children and 12,000 women. The human toll extended beyond civilians in their homes \u2014 with over 1,400 doctors and nurses murdered while treating the wounded, and over 250 journalists killed while documenting the war. Refugee camps, hospitals, and schools \u2014 the very symbols of sanctuary \u2014 had been reduced to rubble.\n\nBendjama\u2019s appeals for an immediate ceasefire, were not just rhetorical. It was a moral indictment of the Security Council which allowed impunity to prevail. Of 15 Security Council members, fourteen voted for the resolution. Only one \u2014 the United States \u2014 stood in opposition, silencing the Council\u2019s consensus, amidst the Ambassador\u2019s words: \u201cHistory will not forgive our silence. The people of Gaza will not forget.\u201d\n\nBendjama shifted the tone of the debate from procedural politics to raw humanity. We are witnessing again and again, the political paralysis of the Security Council, despite the legal findings of genocide and incitement- Global governance held hostage by a single veto."

He focused on the challenges facing both Sri Lanka and the world, urging the international community to confront pressing issues, from poverty and corruption to the devastating effects of war, advocating for a united effort toward peace, human rights, and sustainable development.\n\nAllow me, Madam Annalena Baerbock, to begin my speech by offering my warmest congratulations to you on being elected President of the 80th session of this unique organisation formed with the noble aim of bringing about a just and lasting peace among and to nations of the world. I would also like to use this opportunity to express my country\u2019s appreciation to His Excellency Philemon Yang for the exceptional leadership he provided during the 79th Session.\n\nWe are gathered here today to charter the future path of an organisation which has worked tirelessly for eight decades to bring about a world of peace and democracy. The decisions we make now will impact on people across the world and play a decisive role in the future of this planet, our common home.\n\nPoverty, a tragedy as old as human civilisation, has accompanied humankind on its journey through time.

For centuries, countries across the world have faced this painful and relentless struggle. Poverty, and problems stemming from it, are also casting an oppressive shadow on our future.\n\nIn a world that produces nearly 6 billion tonnes of food every year, one in nine people suffer from hunger or malnutrition. In a world that spends nearly $ 2.4 trillion on military expenditure every year, over 300,000 children under five die from diarrhoeal diseases caused by lack of clean water and sanitation. Half of child deaths globally are linked to hunger.\n\nA child\u2019s right to education is an internationally accepted basic right. This right is enshrined in the constitutions of most of our nations. Yet, across the world, poverty has denied this right to hundreds of thousands of children. In a world which boasts of its technological advances, how can there be children without schools?\n\nEducation is the foundation of every great nation. It is the most vital factor deciding the shape of our future. We firmly believe that investment in education is an investment in global progress.\n\nMany developing countries are constrained in their struggle against poverty by indebtedness. In low income countries twice more is spent on net interest rates than on education or health. Our people and our countries are caught in debt traps. The global debt crisis demands an urgent and positive resolution.\n\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development pledges to leave no one behind and to reach the last first. The Agenda acknowledges the most critical challenge before the world is the challenge to end poverty. I would also like to bring to your notice the decisions taken at the Global Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen in 1995. Unexpected wars and political upheavals and the COVID pandemic obstructed the fulfilment of these hopeful agendas."

But if the courageous step we take is correct, a thousand steps will follow that first step.\u201d I believe this.\n\n\u201cBe brave. All the rest will follow,\u201d Sri Jawaharlal Nehru said. I represent a small luminous island of nearly 22 million people. Sri Lanka\u2019s population is about 0.28% of global population. It is true that we are small in size and in numbers. Yet we have begun the struggle against corruption for the future generations of our country and the world.\n\nI propose that the struggle against corruption should become an integral part of the culture of all UN member nations.\n\nI feel confident that all of you will join me in rejecting war. There is no nation in the world that hopes for war. Wherever a war happens, tragedy results. Even now, many lands of the world are experiencing the pain of that tragedy. As a country that lived through a three-decade war, we know well the uselessness of war. No one who sees the pain and the suffering of parents, spouses, and children of the dead at war memorials would want to see a war even in dreams. These painful scenes we have seen with our own eyes.\n\nEven as suffering caused by conflict has reached unprecedented levels, the international community has become reduced to bystanders. Opportunistic power politics has turned lives of children and innocent civilians into a mere football. No one has the right to inflict pain and suffering on another to enhance one\u2019s own power.

Both sides must get together to implement the UN mandated two states solution, setting up two neighbouring states along 1967 borders. The time has come for the international community to cease being a spectator and move decisively to end the suffering of millions.\n\nReligious extremism and racism have been major causes of wars and conflicts bringing suffering to millions of people. Though slavery has been abolished, the poison of racism lingers in places. Extremist and racist ideas are as deadly as epidemics. We must ask ourselves how these extremist and racist ideas survive, like sparks under the ashes, in a world that has witnessed so many advances on so many fronts. We must be alive to the danger of these sparks being opportunistically turned into infernos threatening the wellbeing of the entire world.\n\nI believe that we must awaken our consciences to oppose racism and religious extremism in protection of human rights and freedoms.

We hope our country will not have to experience the horrors of war ever again. We invite the world to witness the miracle of a warless land, a land of peace and beauty. The people of our country opted for a united Sri Lankan nation based on a new political culture. My Government is committed to fulfilling that mandate.\n\nI would like to remind you that at the last election, Sri Lankan people decided in favour of a centuries-old dream. A myriad legislature was born of that decision, reflecting the ethnic and religious diversity of the country, a parliament in which women and other marginalised communities are present in unprecedented numbers including Sri Lanka\u2019s first visually impaired parliamentarian. We are committed to ensure equal rights and opportunities for all our citizens. We have also proved by example that parliamentarians are there to serve the people and not enjoy privileges denied to people.\n\nWe believe that the duty of legislators is to develop the country and the people and not themselves."

To fulfil this historic mandate, we have focused on a non-corrupt administration, poverty eradicating, digitalisation, and a clean country. We also place great emphasis on health and education. We are moving towards these goals step by step.\n\nDigital democracy is one of our aims. Ensuring that every person, every land can enjoy the opportunities of the digital age is a global challenge. If we succeed in our task, we will be able to open doors to technology, accelerate development, and strengthen governance. If we fail, technology will turn into one more force worsening inequality, insecurity and injustice.\n\nThe digital gap between states that can and cannot wield digital tools is clear. An even greater gap is being created in relation to artificial intelligence. Sri Lanka and many other developing nations are facing challenges in using AI as a development tool due to inadequate infrastructure facilities.\n\nI ask the international community to work together to remove AI technological inequalities.

He emphasised the need for both governments and the private sector to redirect capital toward priority areas and to strengthen delivery on existing commitments.\n\nParticipants engaged with the UN Global Compact Sustainable Finance Roadmap, which outlines six critical transitions: food systems, energy, digital access, education, jobs, and climate and biodiversity.

The delegation\u2019s contribution also reflected a recognition that aligning with international sustainability standards is central to building credibility and attracting investment.\n\nFor Sri Lanka, the themes addressed at the Forum resonate strongly with national priorities.

    "chunk_text": "SJB to move no-confidence motion against Speaker\n\nThe Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has announced plans to table a no-confidence motion against Speaker of Parliament Dr. Jagath Wickramaratne, citing his recent conduct in presiding over Parliamentary proceedings.\n\nAddressing the House, SJB legislator Ajith P. Perera charged that the Speaker had dismissed a previously submitted motion of no confidence without giving reasons. He argued that such actions weaken democratic safeguards and diminish the principle of accountability within Parliament.\n\nHowever, responding to the Opposition\u2019s criticism, Speaker Dr. Wickramaratne yesterday defended his decision to reject the no-confidence motion brought last month against Deputy Defence Minister Major General (Retd.) Aruna Jayasekera.\n\nThe Speaker cited Standing Order 76(1), which vests in him the responsibility for maintaining Parliamentary rules of order, noting that his rulings cannot be appealed except through a substantive motion made after due notice. He argued that both the Constitution and the Standing Orders are silent on the procedure for moving a no-confidence motion against individual Cabinet or Deputy Ministers.\n\nThe only express provision, he pointed out, is Article 49(2) of the Constitution, which provides for a no-confidence motion against the Government as a whole.\n\nWhile acknowledging that motions have previously been brought against Prime Ministers and individual Ministers despite this silence, the Speaker questioned the legal basis of such precedents. He observed that in the Sri Lankan context, no-confidence motions can be more appropriately brought against Parliamentary office-bearers such as the Speaker, Deputy Speaker, Leader of the House, or the Leader of the Opposition."

However, he suggested that members consider submitting a substantive motion instead, especially given the national importance of the matters raised in relation to the Easter Sunday attacks.\n\nHe also noted that the Attorney General had opined that the specific facts cited in the motion did not directly affect pending Court proceedings."

    "chunk_text": "Fitch assigns Hayleys Fentons first-time national rating of \u2018A+(lka)\u2019; outlook stable\n\nFitch Ratings has assigned Hayleys Fentons Ltd., (HFL) a National Long-Term Rating of \u2018A+(lka)\u2019. The outlook is stable.\n\nThe rating reflects HFL\u2019s leading market share in domestic rooftop solar panel sales and installation, which drove cash flow in the financial year ending March 2025 (FY25), alongside slowing growth amid regulatory risks. Diversification into power generation over the next few years carries execution risk but could enhance revenue visibility, subject to the weak credit quality of the sole offtaker, Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB, A(lka)/Stable).\n\nHFL\u2019s A+(lka) rating comprises its standalone credit profile of \u2018a(lka)\u2019 and a one-notch uplift for support from its stronger parent, Hayleys PLC (AAA(lka)/Stable), reflecting moderate operating incentives but low legal and strategic incentives.\n\nRooftop solar sales to ease: Fitch expects HFL\u2019s rooftop solar panel sales in Sri Lanka to decline modestly over the next few years. However, we expect growth in HFL\u2019s other businesses, such as services and solutions for the construction sector, to mitigate the impact on cash flow, supported by recovering consumption and construction activity. Overall, we expect EBITDA from HFL\u2019s existing businesses to remain steady in FY26-FY29, before considering the contribution from planned power generation projects."

Overall, we expect EBITDA from HFL\u2019s existing businesses to remain steady in FY26-FY29, before considering the contribution from planned power generation projects.\n\nExecution risks in power generation: HFL\u2019s plans to construct a 50MW wind power plant and 37 ground-mounted solar power plants with a combined capacity of 149MW, on an alternating current equivalent basis (AC), are subject to execution risk. These projects are contingent on a multitude of approvals from regulators, environmental bodies and local governments, and subject to funding and land acquisition. Commissioning of solar plants and cash flow generation should take a further 90 days on average after power purchase agreements (PPAs) are signed with CEB, while the wind project is likely to be commissioned over 18 months.\n\nHFL has signed several solar PPAs and expects the remainder by end-November 2025, subject to the requisite approvals. Following a 30-day pause to address local community concerns, the wind plant \u2013 whose PPA was signed in May 2025 \u2013 received Governmental approval to recommence work in September 2025. Commissioning is likely by September 2026, later than HFL\u2019s previous target of April 2026. The wind and solar projects when commissioned will generate around two thirds of annual EBITDA by FY28, diversifying HFL\u2019s cash flow and increasing revenue visibility, but subject to CEB\u2019s counterparty risk."

Annual interest costs will rise, as interest payments are subject to grace periods during project construction, and interest accrued during construction is capitalised and added to outstanding debt balance.\n\nParent support: Fitch assesses \u2018Medium\u2019 operational incentives for Hayleys to support HFL due to fully integrated branding and management between the two entities. Legal incentives are \u2018Low\u2019, reflecting the waning parent guarantees on HFL\u2019s bank debt amid the subsidiary\u2019s improving credit profile. However, significant parent guarantees on bank debt have been forthcoming to HFL when required. Strategic incentives for Hayleys to support are also \u2018Low\u2019 given the parent\u2019s highly diversified operations."

Four years on, Sri Lanka has asset portals and press releases \u2014 but still no public indictments from Pandora. Where, exactly, does this investigation lead?\n\nFour years after the ICIJ\u2019s Pandora Papers exposed offshore holdings linked to Sri Lankan political figures, the country\u2019s legal response remains stalled. While the Anti-Corruption Act, the Proceeds of Crime Act and the National Anti-Corruption Action Plan (2025\u20132029) have expanded the formal framework, no indictments or tax outcomes tied to Pandora have been brought before court. The article uses the Lasantha Wickrematunge case to illustrate how prosecutorial volatility erodes public trust and underscores the wider pattern of announcements without enforcement. With a new Chief Justice and sharper statutory tools, the institutional architecture exists; yet outcomes depend on whether charge sheets are filed, defended and seen to conclusion.

He further said that their contribution played a vital role in their victory.\n\n\u201cIn the 2019 elections, our party secured only about 3% of the vote. However, in the 2024 presidential election, followed by the general election, we emerged with the highest number of parliamentary seats in Sri Lanka\u2019s history,\u201d he said.\n\nRecalling the events of April 12, 2022, the President pointed out that Sri Lanka officially declared its inability to repay its debts, marking its entry into bankruptcy.\n\nHe further observed that the government in power at the time had, for the first time in the country\u2019s history, expelled the people in response to the crisis.\n\n\u201cOur main challenges were twofold: to resolve the immediate economic crisis and to lay the foundation to ensure that such a collapse will never recur,\u201d he explained.\n\nAccording to President Dissanayake, the government has managed to significantly ease the crisis within just one year.\n\n\u201cInternational organizations, credit rating agencies, and financial institutions have recognized Sri Lanka\u2019s rapid recovery compared with other nations that have faced similar crises,\u201d he stated."

    "chunk_text": "Trump announces 100% tariff on branded or patented pharmaceutical imports from Oct 1\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump announced on Thursday (Sep 25) new tariffs on pharmaceuticals, big-rig trucks, home renovation fixtures and furniture.\n\nStarting Oct 1, \u201cwe will be imposing a 100 per cent tariff on any branded or patented pharmaceutical product, unless a company IS BUILDING their pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in America\u201d, the Republican wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\nIn a separate post, he wrote of a 25 per cent tariff on \u201call \u2018heavy (big) trucks\u2019 made in other parts of the world\u201d to support US manufacturers such as \u201cPeterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks and others\u201d.\n\nHe said the truck tariffs were \u201cfor many reasons, but above all else, for national security purposes\u201d.\n\nEarlier this year, the Trump administration launched a probe into imports of trucks to \u201cdetermine the effects of national security\u201d.\n\nThe real estate tycoon also targeted home renovation materials, writing that \u201cwe will be imposing a 50 per cent tariff on all kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and associated products\u201d as of Oct 1.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, we will be charging a 30 per cent tariff on upholstered furniture,\u201d he added.\n\nTariffs have been a feature of Trump\u2019s second term, with duties on trading partners ranging from 10 per cent to 50 per cent and other targeted tariffs on a wide variety of products, casting a shadow over the global economic outlook and paralysing business decision-making.\n\nThe announcements did not include details about whether the new levies would apply on top of national tariffs or whether economies with trade deals such as the European Union and Japan would be exempted.\n\nThe new actions are seen as part of the Trump administration\u2019s shift to better-established legal authorities for its tariff actions, given the risks associated with a case before the Supreme Court on the legality of his sweeping global tariffs."

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says Washington could collect US$300 billion by the end of the year, more than triple its annual tariff revenue in recent years.\n\nTrump previously imposed national security tariffs on steel and aluminium and derivatives, light-duty autos and parts, and copper.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s trade deals with Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom include provisions that cap tariffs for specific products such as autos, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, which means the new higher national security tariffs likely will not raise them above agreed rates.\n\nTrump said the new heavy-duty truck tariffs were to protect manufacturers from \u201cunfair outside competition\u201d and said the move would benefit companies such as Paccar-owned Peterbilt and Kenworth and Daimler Truck-owned Freightliner.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America opposed new drug tariffs, saying earlier this year that 53 per cent by value of the US$85.6 billion in ingredients used in medicines consumed in the US was manufactured in the US, with the remainder from Europe and other US allies.\n\nThe US Chamber of Commerce earlier urged the department not to impose new truck tariffs, noting the top five import sources are Mexico, Canada, Japan, Germany, and Finland, \u201call of which are allies or close partners of the US posing no threat to US national security\u201d."

    "chunk_text": "The US Chamber of Commerce earlier urged the department not to impose new truck tariffs, noting the top five import sources are Mexico, Canada, Japan, Germany, and Finland, \u201call of which are allies or close partners of the US posing no threat to US national security\u201d.\n\nTrump in August had promised to impose new furniture tariffs, saying it would bring the furniture business back to North Carolina, South Carolina and Michigan.\n\nFurniture and wood products manufacturing employment in the US has halved since 2000 to around 340,000 today, according to government statistics.\n\nThe US imported about US$25.5 billion in furniture in 2024, up 7 per cent over 2023, with about 60 per cent of those imports coming from Vietnam and China, according to Furniture Today, a trade publication.\n\nHigher tariffs on commercial vehicles could put pressure on transportation costs just as Trump has vowed to reduce inflation, especially on consumer goods such as groceries.\n\nTariffs could also affect Chrysler-parent Stellantis which produces heavy-duty Ram trucks and commercial vans in Mexico. Sweden\u2019s Volvo Group is building a US$700 million heavy-truck factory in Monterrey, Mexico, due to start operations in 2026.\n\nMexico is home to 14 manufacturers and assemblers of buses, trucks, and tractor trucks, and two manufacturers of engines, according to the US International Trade Administration.\n\nThe country is also the leading global exporter of tractor trucks, 95 per cent of which are destined for the United States.\n\nMexico opposed new tariffs, telling the Commerce Department in May that all Mexican trucks exported to the United States have on average 50 per cent US content, including diesel engines.\n\nLast year, the United States imported almost US$128 billion in heavy vehicle parts from Mexico, accounting for approximately 28 per cent of total US imports, Mexico said."

    "chunk_text": "Sri Lanka exporters urge govt to delay SVAT removal until proper refunding system in place\n\nECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka exporters collectively have urged the government to delay the removal of SVAT, a tax they have to pay up front when they export before they receive the money from buyers.\n\nThe exporters will have to pay interest on cash flow given to the state as a result of charging value added tax on local inputs, following the scrapping of the so-called SVAT scheme, which is a tax payment system based on vouchers.\n\nThe government has said the existing SVAT will be removed from October 1.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s argument that they want to remove SVAT is that some leakages are happening. What we are telling them is if there are leakages happening, don\u2019t carpet bomb all of us. You deal with that. That\u2019s the job of the IRD (Inland Revenue Department),\u201d Shiham Marikkar, Secretary General/CEO at National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCESL).\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s their problem. They have to deal with that. You cannot carpet bomb all of the exporters.\u201d\n\nThe government has promised to refund the money once settled within 45 days, but exporters say they are not confident about the existing digital infrastructure system including lack of e-invoicing.\n\n\u201cWithout the e invoicing, we know that there\u2019s going to be issues. This will open the door to corruption. Because one of the reasons the SVAT was introduced was due to corruption,\u201d Marikkar said.\n\n\u201cThe doors could open again to corruption. So here the government is now talking about eradicating corruption. Government is talking about increasing exports. But this move to remove SVAT in October, we feel, will have a negative impact.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are requesting the government to delay this until the e-invoicing and a completely functional digital platform is ready, and the exporters are confident about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the government can delay VAT on online businesses, why can\u2019t it delay for exporters?\u201d"

However, exporters say there was no pilot project done.\n\nUnder the current SVAT system, exporters defer paying full VAT on locally procured inputs and avoid the often long delays in VAT refunds, which helps keep working capital free for daily operations.\n\nWithout SVAT, businesses will have to pay VAT upfront on inputs and wait for refunds through a refund system that has historically been slow and unpredictable \u2014 sometimes taking several months.\n\nThis shift would tie up capital, increase borrowing costs, degrade margins, and reduce investor confidence. Sectors like tea, apparel, and small-holder agriculture are especially vulnerable, since many firms operate on tight margins and rely heavily on credit.\n\nFurther, stakeholders argue that the removal is being rushed without the substitute systems fully tested.\n\nThe exporters\u2019 associations (including the National Chamber of Exporters, the Joint Apparel Association Forum etc.) have repeatedly called for a \u201ccashless, seamless refund mechanism\u201d before abolishing SVAT.\n\nThey warn that reverting to pre-SVAT refund procedures will re-introduce excessive paperwork, administrative bottlenecks, and risk of delays that will damage exports\u2019 price competitiveness in global markets."

If you look at the debt service payments this year, even after completing the debt restructuring we started repaying at least the interest and some of the external payments for ADB, World Bank continued,\u201d Governor Weerasinghe told reporters on Wednesday at the Central Bank\u2019s post-Monetary Policy Review media briefing.\n\n\u201cIn addition, there is another central bank debt service also. For example, now we had this 2.6 billion swap with RBI (Reserve Bank of India). We are in the process of repaying that also,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the government also settled short term trade credit from India borrowed during the crisis time in 2022.\n\n\u201cAs a result, there were some relatively high foreign currency debt services for the government. Debt service payments are already fixed. Our central bank obligations to service state, as well as government obligations are going through our reserves.\u201d\n\nThe government has allocated over Rs1300 billion for capital investment this year, but only less that quarter of this money is used due to delay in the procurement process and the full year budget.\n\n\u201cInflow for the government is whatever they get from ADB, World Bank, IMF, and other partners. There\u2019s a delay in getting some of the inflows. Once you get the other inflows in, we can see the improvement going forward\u201d he said."

The cultural heritage and scenic environment surrounding the airport are expected to complement these efforts.\n\nCivil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka (CAASL) officials, led by Chairman Sunil Jayarathne, recently visited the Batticaloa Airport to assess opportunities and discuss logistics. The delegation included Director General Captain Daminda Rambukwella and Deputy Director Generals Rehan Wanniappa and M.A.K. Prasanna. The visit was conducted under the guidance of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation Minister Bimal Rathnayake and Deputy Minister Janith Ruwan Kodithuwakku.\n\nJayarathne acknowledged that although Batticaloa Airport was developed with public funds and integrated into the domestic airport network, its current operations remain minimal. \u201cWe had to look into ways to get rid of that situation and bring aircraft to this airport in a way that would benefit the public as well as the national economy,\u201d he said."

    "chunk_text": "Zakath and poverty: Why the powerful tool falls short in Sri Lanka\n\nZakath is designed not merely to relieve poverty temporarily but to eradicate it by creating economic balance and social solidarity\n\nModern business enterprises are scientific, complex, and competitive. No project can succeed without rigorous planning \u2014 including feasibility studies, project appraisals, business models, and risk management strategies. Although zakath administrators and volunteers dedicate themselves selflessly, most lack the technical expertise required for such tasks. Many are unfamiliar with the importance of professional assessments, while others are hesitant to allocate funds for preliminary studies, considering them \u201cwasteful.\u201d This approach, however, contradicts both reason and revelation\n\nZakath (micro finance of a minority Muslim community) is not merely an act of charity but a system meant to eradicate poverty and strengthen social justice. In Sri Lanka, however, its potential remains underutilised due to a consumption-heavy approach and lack of sustainable strategies. Unless zakath distribution evolves from relief to empowerment, Muslims will continue to face the painful irony of widespread poverty, which is said to be three times higher than the national average.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, zakath is too often spoken of only during Ramazan, when most Muslims rush to fulfil their duty and then let the dialog fade away for another year. Yet, zakath was never meant to be a passing ritual; it is a social justice and a lifeline for the poor. If practiced with vision and commitment, it can become a powerful force that uplifts families, restores dignity, and transforms entire communities.\n\nBy raising this call now, I hope to awaken zakath payers, administrators and other stakeholders for a continuous dialogue \u2014 one that sees zakath not as a seasonal obligation, but as a year-round mission of justice and compassion."

    "chunk_text": "By raising this call now, I hope to awaken zakath payers, administrators and other stakeholders for a continuous dialogue \u2014 one that sees zakath not as a seasonal obligation, but as a year-round mission of justice and compassion.\n\nBased on international data, when examining the economic condition of Sri Lankan Muslims, the question arises: out of roughly 500,000 Muslim families, how many actually earn more than Rs. 96,750 per month? My observation is that well over 75% of the Muslim community continues to live below the poverty line.\n\nWhen viewed against national statistics, the picture becomes even more concerning. According to 2024 data, Sri Lanka\u2019s per capita income stands at Rs. 1,296,000 ($ 4,320) per year. For a family of five, this translates into an average monthly household income of Rs. 540,000. Readers may judge for themselves how many Muslim families actually reach this benchmark. In my assessment, fewer than 10% of all Muslim households fall into this category.\n\nThis article does not attempt to revisit the usual questions\u2014such as what zakath means, which items are subject to it, what is exempt, or what rates apply. Those matters have been discussed in depth for centuries.\n\nInstead, the focus here is on why zakath has not lived up to its true potential. The greater irony is that while Muslims are often seen as a business community, the large sums collected in the name of zakath have brought little lasting change.\n\nZakath is a mandatory financial obligation in Islam, required of Muslims whose annual wealth or periodic agricultural produce exceeds the prescribed threshold. This threshold is measured as the equivalent of 84 grams of pure gold for wealth, and 647 kilograms of rice for agricultural produce. Accordingly, it is obvious that it is the wealth tax calculated \u2013with few changes \u2013 on the basis of net assets of a balance sheet rather than on income basis."

In contrast, relative poverty is often debated in developed nations, where not owning a luxurious car, for example, may be considered a sign of poverty. What is dealt with in this discourse is the absolute poverty.\n\nThe Qur\u2019an underscores its importance more than 30 times, as in:\n\n\u201cTake from their wealth charity by which you may cleanse them and purify them, and invoke blessings upon them.\u201d (Qur\u2019an 9:103)\n\nThe Prophet (pbuh) emphasised both its spiritual and social dimensions, warning that hoarded wealth would become a torment in the Hereafter and encouraging prompt charity as a shield against calamity.\n\nIn short, zakath is designed not merely to relieve poverty temporarily but to eradicate it by creating economic balance and social solidarity.\n\nDespite the significant sums of zakath disbursed \u2014 estimated at over Rs. 1 billion annually \u2014 poverty among Sri Lankan Muslims remains disproportionately high. Why has zakath fallen short of its mission and objective?\n\nThe main reason \u2013 as I see \u2013 for the dismal performance of zakath in Sri Lanka lies in its distribution mechanism:"

Why has zakath fallen short of its mission and objective?\n\nThe main reason \u2013 as I see \u2013 for the dismal performance of zakath in Sri Lanka lies in its distribution mechanism:\n\nLimited investment efforts: Only a small share is directed toward income-generating projects and long term effective projects. Many such projects fail due to poor planning, insufficient capital, or lack of oversight, discouraging further attempts.\n\nThe outcome of such inefficient zakath distribution provides temporary relief rather than long-term empowerment and creates a dependency culture, leaving poverty levels largely unchanged.\n\nFor zakath to fulfil its true purpose, a shift in approach is necessary. The holy Quran emphasises this paradigm shift as follows:\n\n\u201cIndeed, Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves (mentality and attitude).\u201d (Qur\u2019an 13:11)\n\nThe fact that a zakath institution is governed by pious and senior citizens, shall not of itself ensure the efficiency or success of the zakath or its institution. Proper plan, knowledge and strategy are too fundamentally important for success of such zakath mechanism.\n\nBalancing relief with empowerment: Immediate basic needs of the destitute and poor must be met, but equal focus should be placed on programs that build skills, create jobs, and generate sustainable income.\n\nProfessional management: Zakath institutions need qualified professionals who can design, monitor, and evaluate poverty-alleviation projects effectively.\n\nCommunity involvement: Encouraging collaboration and contribution beyond Zakath payers and its administrators, ensures that poverty alleviation becomes a collective mission, as intended by the Qur\u2019an."

No project can succeed without rigorous planning \u2014 including feasibility studies, project appraisals, business models, and risk management strategies.\n\nAlthough zakath administrators and volunteers dedicate themselves selflessly, most lack the technical expertise required for such tasks. Many are unfamiliar with the importance of professional assessments, while others are hesitant to allocate funds for preliminary studies, considering them \u201cwasteful.\u201d\n\nThis approach, however, contradicts both reason and revelation. The Qur\u2019an itself commands:\n\n\u201cSo ask those who possess knowledge if you do not know.\u201d (Qur\u2019an 16:43)\n\nIncorporating professionals \u2014 economists, financial analysts, industry experts \u2014 is not optional but indispensable. Their services must be regarded as an investment, not an expense. Zakath funds set aside for Aamileen (administrators), one of the eight Qur\u2019anic categories of Zakath, can justifiably cover such costs.\n\nAnother major weakness is the \u201cscattergun\u201d approach: dividing available funds into small shares so that as many recipients as possible are included. While this satisfies the desire to maximise the number of beneficiaries, it leaves each recipient with insufficient capital to launch or sustain a viable business. In effect, everyone receives something, but no one receives enough.\n\nInstead, zakath institutions should allocate capital according to project requirements as determined by professional evaluations. Quality must be prioritised over sheer quantity.\n\nA promising approach \u2013in event of insufficiency of the capital \u2013 is to establish joint business ventures through collective zakath funding:"

This ensures they are not just passive recipients but genuine participants in wealth creation.\n\nEven with sound planning and adequate capital, businesses fail without competent management. Many zakath-funded ventures collapse because recipients lack the necessary skills in production, human resources, marketing, and financial control.\n\nThe Qur\u2019an advises against entrusting wealth to those unable to manage it:\n\n\u201cAnd do not give the weak-minded your property, which Allah has made a means of sustenance for you. Provide for them from it, clothe them, and speak to them with kind words.\u201d (Qur\u2019an 4:5)\n\nThis verse underscores the Islamic concept of wealth as a trust (amanah).

As trustees, zakath administrators must ensure wealth is managed effectively for the collective good.\n\nThe most appropriate mechanism is a Board of Directors comprised of:\n\nQualified professionals with expertise in the relevant industry (regardless of caste or religion) and\n\nThese directors should be compensated at competitive market rates to ensure commitment and quality."

The AKD presidency revealed its reality in its first year. It showed its soul.\n\nPresident AKD spoke at length about economics at the ceremony to kick-off construction of the Kadawatha-Mirigama segment of the Central Expressway project. This passage is key:\n\n\u201c\u2026Even by today, the IMF, World Bank and rating agencies have given extremely important signals about our economy. I saw a report in which the World Bank has given us the recognition that in rebuilding broken-down states, the fastest speed has been registered by Sri Lanka. This is an extremely important factor. Therefore, we are proceeding on our journey with great steadiness and stability\u2026\u201d\n\nTV news showed JVP chief theoretician Bimal Rathnayake leading the cheers as Anura paused, having enunciated this wisdom.\n\nAKD\u2019s self-placement of the Report as a feather in his cap revealed not only his self-image but also his chosen path and actual ideological orientation. Clearly, on economics he stands to the right of the World Bank report and the World Bank itself. An obvious but cheap shot that the World Bank report has been \u2018lost in translation\u2019 would provide AKD with an undeserved excuse. The big news about World Bank Report was not that it patted AKD on the back-- which it did, but it was a left-handed pat. The big news was that it surfaced the dreadful downside of an unprecedentedly sharp and speedy fiscal adjustment, i.e., \u2018shock therapy\u2019."

Over 75 percent of this adjustment has been derived from indirect taxes that disproportionately burden the poor. Following the 2024 reforms, VAT now consumes 5.3 percent of the pre-fiscal income of households in the poorest decile, compared to just 3.3 percent for those in the richest decile.\n\n\u2026 What has happened so far is difficult to justify since VAT reforms have pushed the national poverty level higher.

The 109-page report is anchored in the theoretical certainty that austerity was a painful but necessary adjustment following Sri Lanka\u2019s default on its external debts in 2022. Yet even within this paradigm, the report provides a treasure trove of data that serves as a damning indictment of how austerity has suppressed investment, undermined growth, and deepened social distress.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, across 330 episodes of austerity in 123 countries between 1980 and 2024, Sri Lanka\u2019s \u2018fiscal adjustment\u2019 from 2021 to 2024 stands out as being \u2018sharper and faster\u2019\u2026\n\n\u2026The human toll of this austerity policy is hard to digest. The report states that more than a quarter of the population has fallen below the poverty line, with another third of the population categorised as vulnerable and living on the brink of poverty. The report acknowledges that a four percent increase in poverty was directly attributable to the fiscal adjustment between mid-2022 and mid-2023. The poor have been disproportionately impacted; the removal of electricity subsidies alone led to a five percent decrease in disposable income for the poorest households."

A recent study found that an estimated 1,489 doctors, including specialists, emigrated between 2022 and 2024, causing a financial burden of nearly $41.5 million to the Sri Lankan government and taxpayers.

He could have attended the BRICS Plus summit to secure a backstop in the renegotiation; made the point with the IMF that President Wickremesinghe was not an elected President and lacked the popular mandate to sign the agreement he did; mentioned that the IMF had expressed a willingness to renegotiate, to the Leader of the Opposition; recalled the Aragalaya and emphasised the volatility of the popular mood; invited professors Martin Guzman (former Finance Minister of Argentina) and Jayati Ghosh as advisors/consultants to the Sri Lankan side.\n\nInstead, he picked Duminda Hulangamuwa, chairman of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce which contains local holders of sovereign bonds, as a key Presidential advisor and negotiator with the foreign private creditors\u2014clearly a conflict of interest.\n\nThe litmus test was with the foreign private bondholders. Unlike the IMF deal, there was no agreement formally signed by Ranil Wickremesinghe. Ranil had entered merely an \u2018agreement-in-principle\u2019 which Anura was in no way bound by.

It has no universalist compass and didn\u2019t see the need for one, thinking it restrictive. That leaves a witches-brew of crass opportunism, amorality, low cunning, unconscionable dissembling and coercion-inflected absolutism as guiding spirit, ethos. This degenerates into conversion to the extreme right; it doesn\u2019t develop into a moderate, rational, pluralist left. That\u2019s why Anura and the JVP-NPP didn\u2019t adopt a social democratic or progressive path in foreign debt repayment, international policy, the Tamil Question, Israel\u2019s genocidal war (and local encroachments), or anything else."

Dr. Jayatissa announcing the decision emphasised that this measure not only enables judicial efficiency, but also provides opportunities for social rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders within their own societies.\n\nHe said both decisions are expected to mark an important step in reinforcing bilateral ties with the Philippines in the areas of justice, law enforcement, and criminal rehabilitation.\n\nBoth agreements, proposed by Justice and National Integration Minister Harshana Nanayakkara, were approved by the Cabinet of Ministers."

According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the proportion of Sri Lankans aged 60 years and above is projected to rise to 24.8% by 2052. As a result, this demographic shift demands stronger measures to safeguard the welfare and rights of senior citizens.\n\nThe updated national policy is designed to enable older citizens to live with dignity in supportive social, economic, physical, and spiritual environments. Developed under the theme \u201cRespectful Senior Citizen \u2013 Meaningful Retirement\u201d, the framework emphasises both protection and empowerment, aligning with the Government\u2019s broader policy priorities.\n\nAddressing the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing\u00a0 on Tuesday, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said the new approach seeks to ensure that Sri Lanka\u2019s ageing population remains integrated and active in society, while also strengthening systems that provide care and protection for vulnerable elderly groups.\n\nHe said the move underscores the Government\u2019s recognition that addressing the needs of senior citizens is central to long-term social protection and inclusive development in the country.\n\nThe proposal to this effect was submitted by Rural Development, Social Protection and Community Empowerment Minister Dr. Upali Pannilage."

Paranthan Chemicals has already completed a feasibility study and is preparing detailed plans to restart operations at the site.\n\nCurrently, the company imports chlorine for nationwide distribution, as the entire domestic requirement for water purification depends on imports.

It did not work for Marie but President Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) seems a firm believer in her bag of tricks. She believed cake will work in place of bread despite the price, but does AKD? Can Tamils be bought over so easily?\n\nMany of us in the Tamil Country were willing to forget that one of the JVP\u2019s five lessons in 1971 was that we Tamils are intrinsicallly chauvinistic and a fifth column for India as Indian aircraft and helicopters straffed JVP positions in 1971.\n\nDespite not being the main target of the 1971 violence, the JVP\u2019s ideology was distinctly nationalist and chauvinistic towards the Tamil community. Key elements of this anti-Tamil stance included the JVP\u2019s communalism then. There were strong rumours about we Tamils being so reactionary and staunch agents of India meriting execution if aged over 60. Age and being reactionary went together in their minds. Unfortunately this was widely believed and heard by those who were in universities in 1971 but there is little in print to support this.\n\nHowever, there is much to support that the JVP\u00a0never recognized the specific issues facing the Tamil community regarding language, religion, and culture. They failed to acknowledge the violence Tamils endured and opposed any moves towards power-sharing or autonomy. The JVP used the historical and geopolitical backdrop of India\u2019s large size and influence to stoke fear among the majority Sinhalese community. That fifth lesson warned that any Indian presence on the island would empower the Tamil liberation struggle, which was painted as a threat to national sovereignty. This strategy proved effective in mobilizing its predominantly rural Sinhalese base in 1987-89."

But cricketing authorities claim they need over 100 acres for a viable stadium."

But cricketing authorities claim they need over 100 acres for a viable stadium.\n\nShowing lack of good will, the public request to annex Mandaithivu to Jaffna Town goes ignored, not even including Manadaithivu police into the Jaffna Police Station a mere 3 miles away and insisting it be part of the Kayts Police Station 15 miles away. No Tamil believes the government has no power to accede to a request so practical and practicable.\n\nFor an international stadium the surroundings need hotel room, restaurants, shops, entertainment facilities\u00a0 etc. That is more land. When these suggestions came up during the good governance time, those making making good suggestions asked why the government did not agree when the people lived bereft of these but now suddenly talk about restaurants and hotels in pretended generosity. Talk of the stadium was given up.\n\nA special factor was the amount of water needed. On a normal day, it would take 65,000 litres of water to maintain the stadium grounds. On days the stadium is used, 150,000 to 200,000 liters of water would be required . When the government could not find water as the Mandaitivu population fell from 300,000 to 50,000, where will the government find this water from?"

When the government could not find water as the Mandaitivu population fell from 300,000 to 50,000, where will the government find this water from?\n\nThe Sinhalese Communalist Deep State boasted of a sports ground in Mannar but did nothing. Then they planned a stadium in Jaffna in 2018 proposing a budget for Rs. 5000 million. At the time a bag of cement was Rs. 980 and a tipper load of sand Rs. 345,000. But today these construction costs are 300% up! That is, the cost of a similar-sized stadium would be Rs. 1,500,000 million. The government\u2019s cheating endeavor stands exposed considering that there is no budget proposal for a stadium, not even for the year 2027.\n\nBefore reaching the site of the stadium, one has to pass through 2 acres of land belonging to the Velanai Pradeshiya Sabai which has leased those 2 acres to a businessman who refuses to vacate citing the investments he has has made in building a rest house.\n\nCorrupt Tamil and Sinhalese Businessmen and Government Endangering Public Health\n\nThe South has always been corrupt, but the North has historically been less so (in part because there is less protection for corrupt Tamils). Even the war was unable to ruin the Tamils (with the exception of LTTE maneuvers to wring every penny from the Tamil people). Under this government, however, a corruption nexus is taking over. The following examples demonstrate how pervasive this corruption is\u2013 and how it is putting human life at risk."

The licensing process is very corrupt.\n\nA bigger dimenion of the problem is that at least two of Jaffna Town\u2019s biggest hotels with over 5 floors have a small tank on the third floor accepting toilet flush water from those floors, which are then let off into the drain by Hospital Road. Then, around 11 pm, the flush water is released from the upper floors.\n\nThe improper flushing of waste creates major risk to the population and to the environment. In addition, the Municipality\u2019s bills do not show the revenue collected when the water is properly removed. This reflects a massive loss to the municipality.\n\n2. The Monk Mafia: Similar to the previous item is the Ariya Kulam Guest House for poor Sinhalese pilgrims visiting Naga Vihara and staying at the guest house across from the temple. In yet another instance of Sri Lanka being for Buddhists, the guest house is run by the Navy. Reporters have seen\u00a0 hundreds of guests staying there for about Rs. 2000 a day. These reporters testify that the toilet water is allowed to drain into the sewers, which then goes into the drinking water supply. But fear of the monks, who are powerful with immense political connections through the Sangha, the Navy that runs the guest house, the police, and the government run by Sinhalese and corrupt officials, means that no one can report the issue, endangering the health of all who are innocently and unknowingly drinking this waste water."

Then when he went for some innocuous medical treatment, the medical personnel used the opportunity to declare him a lunatic, so that they could find him medically unfit to practice and forcibly terminate him. Ministry of Health officials were certainly complicit. Dr. Giri then went to Anuradhapura to get himself cleared. The three-member panel, reluctant to contradict the Jaffna doctors, only said he is now well. He is now back in service, but with the stigmatized reputation as one who went mad and is now cured. He is careful not to speak up any\u00a0more.\n\n4. Further Corruption in Municipalities: Another Dr. Umasugi Nadarajah makes astounding accusations of corruption against many, including the police, members of the judiciary, and even the Bribery Commission, fearlessly confronting the high and the low. For example, she filed police complaints against constables for not charging the upper-class people who light fires on the road. When the JMC lawyer asked her to file private action (instead of filing action himself, as is his job) she asked him why he is drawing a salary of 100,000/- a month. The magistrate who heard the complaint ordered a cursory 100/- fine on the people lighting the fires. Now, at her insistence, her complaint has gone up to the the High Court. There has been no time to assess all her claims, but her accusations are not receiving the serious examination they deserve. Instead, reporters I spoke to dismiss her as mad and an SJW (I.e., Social Justice Warrior), one who is warring against all sorts of social ills."

But the rest of the world is finally glimpsing the terror we have endured at your blatantly false narratives for so long, and they are seeing the reality of who you are, who you\u2019ve always been. They watch in utter astonishment the sadism, the glee, the joy, and pleasure with which you conduct, watch, and cheer the daily details of breaking innocent bodies, innocent minds, factual history and therefore, our future."

If she\u2019s looking down from heaven, I suspect she\u2019s quietly pleased with how I\u2019ve navigated this world. She taught me to revere Dr. Samuel Johnson, not just as an erudite Englishman and lexicographer, but as a philosopher who warned, \u201cIntegrity without knowledge is weak and useless, and knowledge without integrity is dangerous and dreadful.\u201d She also introduced me to Mrs. Malaprop, that delightfully misguided character from 18th-century theatre, who mangled words with misplaced confidence.\n\nThanks to my beloved mother, I developed an early aversion to linguistic misuse. Whether in Sinhala or English, the wrong word in the wrong place grates on my ears like a surgical blade drawn across bone and in Sri Lanka, where both languages are wielded by the \u201ceducated,\u201d the misuse is rampant.\n\nTake the Sinhala words \u0d92\u0d9a\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dca\u0dad\u0dba\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca\u0db8 and \u0d85\u0db1\u0dd2\u0dc0\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dba\u0dba\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca\u0db8. The former means \u201cdefinitely, absolutely or most certainly,\u201d the latter \u201ccompulsorily.\u201d Yet the latter is now used indiscriminately, unhesitatingly, and unashamedly in place of the former. Every time I hear it, I challenge it. But mine is a one-man resistance against a linguistically adulterated nation. Still, I press on.\n\nEnglish fares no better. One glaring example is the confusion between digitisation and digitalisation, a distinction that matters more than most realise.\n\nJust days ago, Chief Justice Surasena announced his intention to \u201cfast-track digitalisation\u201d of Sri Lanka\u2019s court system. The goal: to transform how justice is administered. Laudable, yes. But let us pause."

Investigating further, he identified foxglove, now known for its cardiac properties, as the active ingredient. He began experimenting with its three main alkaloids, digoxin, digitoxin and lanatosides, later termed digitalis, and discovered its ability to induce diuresis in patients with oedema.\n\nHis breakthrough came when a prominent Oxford figure, abandoned by the finest physicians, recovered through foxglove treatment. Withering defined the patient profile, standardised leaf preparations, and established dosage guidelines, many still relevant today.\n\nBut his warnings about toxicity were ignored. Physicians misused the drug, harmed patients, and blamed Withering. Disillusioned, he wrote, \u201cShall we wonder then that patients refuse to repeat such a medicine, and that practitioners tremble to prescribe it?\u201d Digitalis fell into disrepute for over a century.\n\nOnly after 150 years did its value in heart failure and arrhythmias gain recognition. It was then that the concept of slow, incremental dosing to reach an optimal therapeutic level was formalised, and the term digitalisation was coined by the medical fraternity.

To conflate the two is not just a lexical error, it\u2019s a conceptual one.\n\nThis semantic slip by the Chief Justice is not a crime, it\u2019s just a reminder. Even the top brass of the judiciary, being human, are fallible. And if they can err in terminology, they can err in judgment. That truth must be acknowledged with humility.\n\nReforms must be meticulous, user-friendly, and humane. They must reduce the travesties of justice, not just in process, but in outcome and for those wronged, there must be quick, easy, and ample room for review, perhaps by a larger bench, perhaps by a wiser one.\n\nLet us not forget Lesego\u2019s father, whose land was taken not by error, but by design. If digitalisation is to mean anything, it must begin with accountability, not just in code, but in conscience."

    "chunk_text": "Understanding The Pitfalls In Marketing Carbon\n\nIt is a tragedy that we still follow the line expounded by the carbon emitters and polluters of the environment. We have accepted a high debt and fossil dependency scenario as the indicator of \u2018Economic Development\u2019. Our concerns with adaptation to the ongoing climate changes brought about by our own actions, seem to be minimal. The current disasters of fishermen getting caught in an sudden, random, wind events, are a foretaste of things to come. Sudden violent downpours that strip and erode the soil or delays in rain bearing winds that create harsh drought conditions, will become more frequent. The \u2018climate affected\u2019 population will grow with every event. We are witnessing the thin edge of the wedge.\n\nThese tragic planetary changes have been brought about by us humans, through the agency of a human created value system that glorifies consumption. The modern notion of economic development assumes that consumption and the turnover of money, powers growth and is therefore good. But it is this very activity that affects the global climate and produces profound suffering for much of humanity, so can it really be called good ?\n\nTo understand this apparent dichotomy we have to understand that, the source of power to propel \u2018Economic Growth\u2019, is firmly anchored in the consumption of fossil energy. Oil and coal were seen as substances with untold promise the development of the industrial revolution. However, this was not a universally shared view. Others, with no vested interest in profit in the promotion of oil saw it differently,\n\nThe Shuar peoples of Amazonian Ecuador, under whose territories lie huge reserves of oil, have rejected oil exploration and extraction, they do not want to get rich on selling oil.\u00a0 They have a saying; \u201cOil\u2019 represents the sprits of a long dead world, that we use to satisfy our greed for power and sacrifice and our children in return.\u201d (CESR 1996)."

One of worst culprits is carbon in the form of Carbon Dioxide. We are told that Carbon Dioxide is a common gas , that is emitted by all living things so their \u2018contribution\u2019 is natural. This brings up the question \u201cdoes all carbon entering the atmosphere have the same value ?\u201d. The resolution to this question can put humanity on a path to real sustainable development and could avert a cataclysmic future. Thus, it is useful to study this question in the light of scientific evidence.\n\nCarbon (C), the fourth most abundant element in the Universe, after hydrogen (H), helium (He), and oxygen (O), is the building block of life. It\u2019s the basic element that anchors all organic substances, from fossil fuels to DNA. On Earth, carbon cycles through the land, ocean, atmosphere, and the Earth\u2019s interior in a major biogeochemical cycle (the circulation of chemical components through the biosphere from or to the lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere). The global carbon cycle can be divided into two categories: the geological/ancient, which operates over large time scales (millions of years), and the biological/modern, which operates at shorter time scales (days to thousands of years)."

The global carbon cycle can be divided into two categories: the geological/ancient, which operates over large time scales (millions of years), and the biological/modern, which operates at shorter time scales (days to thousands of years).\n\nSince those times, carbonic acid (a weak acid derived from the reaction between atmospheric carbon dioxide [CO2] and water) has slowly but continuously combined with calcium and magnesium in the Earth\u2019s crust to form insoluble carbonates (carbon-containing chemical compounds) through a process called weathering. Then, through the process of erosion, the carbonates are washed into the ocean and eventually settle to the bottom. The cycle continues as these materials are drawn into Earth\u2019s mantle by subduction (a process in which one lithospheric plate descends beneath another, often as a result of folding or faulting of the mantle) at the edges of continental plates. The carbon is then returned to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide during volcanic eruptions.\n\nThe balance between weathering, subduction, and volcanism controls atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations over time periods of hundreds of millions of years. The oldest geologic sediments suggest that, before life evolved, the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide may have been one-hundred times that of the present, providing a very different atmosphere and substantial greenhouse effect."

Hundreds of police and paramilitary soldiers patrolled streets Thursday while shops and businesses remained shut due to the restrictions.\n\nWednesday\u2019s clashes erupted after protesters threw stones at officers trying to stop them from marching in the high-altitude town of Leh. Others set ablaze police and paramilitary vehicles and the local office of India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and some other government buildings, police said.\n\nPolice fired bullets and tear gas and swung batons at demonstrators, killing four people and injuring dozens more, police and residents said.\n\nNestled between India, Pakistan and China, Ladakh was split from Indian-controlled Kashmir after New Delhi removed the disputed region\u2019s statehood and semiautonomy in 2019. While Kashmir has largely been silenced through a crackdown on dissent and a slew of new laws, demands for political rights in Ladakh have intensified in recent years.\n\nThe protests are part of a larger movement in the federally governed region seeking statehood and constitutional provisions from the Indian government to gain autonomy over land and agriculture decisions.\n\nThe protests Wednesday were sparked by a local group\u2019s call for a strike after two residents collapsed while participating in a hunger strike with more than a dozen residents who were making statehood demands."

They were investigating who was controlling them and their motive.\n\nOn Monday, Kastrup airport in Copenhagen was forced to shut for several hours following the sighting of a number of drones.\n\n\u201cIt says something about the times we live in and what we as a society must be prepared to deal with,\u201d Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told reporters earlier this week.\n\nRussian involvement could not be ruled out, she added - although Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the allegations \u201cunfounded\u201d.\n\nThen on Wednesday night, at least three flights were diverted from Aalborg airport, with officials saying the Danish Armed Forces were affected as the airport is also used as a military base.\n\nThe North Jutland Police released a statement saying they were monitoring the situation at Aalborg closely but could not elaborate on how many drones were involved.\n\n\u201cWe cannot yet comment on the purpose of the drones flying in the area, nor can we say anything about who the actor behind it is,\u201d chief inspector Jesper B\u00f8jgaard Madsen said.\n\n\u201cIf we get the opportunity, we will take down the drones,\u201d he added.\n\nPolice said they did not believe there was any danger to passengers at the airport or residents, but asked the public to keep their distance from the area."

General Assembly earlier this month overwhelmingly endorsed a seven-page declaration that aims to advance a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians and end the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas militants.\n\nThe declaration emerged from an international conference at the U.N. in July - hosted by Saudi Arabia and France - on the decades-long conflict. The United States and Israel boycotted the event and have rejected the international efforts.\n\nSeparately, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said on Wednesday that Trump had presented a 21-point peace plan for the Middle East and Gaza during a meeting with leaders of several Muslim-majority countries on the sidelines of this week\u2019s U.N. General Assembly.\n\nAbbas addressed the annual gathering of world leaders on Thursday via video after the United States said it give him a visa to travel to New York.\n\n\u201cDespite all that our people have suffered, we reject what Hamas carried out on October 7th - acts that targeted Israeli civilians and took them as hostages \u2014 because such actions do not represent the Palestinian people nor their just struggle for freedom and independence,\u201d Abbas said.\n\n\u201cWe have affirmed \u2014 and will continue to affirm \u2014 that Gaza is an integral part of the State of Palestine, and that we are ready to assume full responsibility for governance and security there. Hamas will have no role in governance, and it - along with other factions - must hand over its weapons to the Palestinian National Authority,\u201d he said. \u201cWe reiterate that we do not want an armed state.\u201d\n\nThe points he raised are included in the declaration endorsed by the General Assembly."

He was handed a one-year sentence, of which six months were suspended.\n\nIn 2021, he was found guilty of trying to bribe a judge in 2014 and became the first former French president to get a custodial sentence. In December, the Paris appeals court ruled that he could serve his time at home wearing a tag instead of going to jail."

The 70-year-old has been on trial since January, in a case he said was politically motivated.\n\nThe court found him guilty of criminal conspiracy between 2005 and 2007. After that he was president and covered by presidential immunity, the court added.\n\nAmong the other accused in the trial were Sarkozy\u2019s former right-hand man Claude Gueant and former Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux. The court found Gueant, also a former Interior Minister, guilty of corruption, among other charges. Hortefeux was found guilty of criminal conspiracy. Despite his legal battles, and having his Legion of Honour, France\u2019s highest distinction, stripped in June, Sarkozy remains an influential figure on the French political stage."

While the city was under the No. 10 Hurricane Signal, the two women, accompanied by a young boy, ventured onto the exposed shoreline.\n\nShock footage, which subsequently spread across social media, shows one woman holding the child while the other appears to be recording a video on her mobile phone.\n\nThe situation turned critical in an instant when a monstrous wave, several metres high, breached the sea wall. The powerful surge completely engulfed the trio, washing them off their feet and onto the pavement behind a barrier.\n\nAudible screams can be heard on the video as the water crashes over them. Miraculously, all three were able to scramble to their feet afterwards, appearing drenched and shaken but escaping serious physical injury.\n\nIn response to the Ap Lei Chau episode, police confirmed they had taken two individuals into custody. Sources indicate the arrested parties are the child\u2019s Indian-born mother and her friend, a Sri Lankan national. They are being investigated for their role in an act that placed the child in clear and imminent danger."

So hopefully we will work into the ascension working group and we are of course in support of any countries that are willing to join RCEP,\u201d she said when met by reporters after the Fourth RCEP Ministers\u2019 meeting in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday (Sept 25).\n\nDyah also said there were no objections by existing members against the four countries joining RCEP.\n\nThe fourth RCEP Ministers\u2019 Meeting is one of the key agendas on the fourth day of the 57th Asean Economic Ministers (AEM) meeting.\n\nObservers have said Malaysia and Asean could leverage the world\u2019s largest free trade agreement amid challenging and uncertain economic conditions with tariffs and growing protectionist policies in the United States.\n\nRCEP is a gateway to a market of more than two billion people and the 15 participating countries account for about 30% of the world\u2019s GDP.\n\nPresently, Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, Chile and Bangladesh have expressed interest in joining RCEP.\n\nRCEP involves all 10 Asean members and five key partners, namely China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIt came into force in 2022 and it aims to lower tariffs, boost investment and allow freer movement of goods within the region."

    "chunk_text": "Asia-Pacific issuers to have bumpy ride as trade strains hit: S&P Global Ratings report\n\nSINGAPORE (S&P Global Ratings) Sept. 24, 2025 \u2014 Asia-Pacific\u2019s credit conditions are keeping steady, after strong first-half growth and supportive financing conditions. However, the road ahead looks bumpy. That\u2019s according to a report S&P Global Ratings published today, titled \u201cCredit Conditions Asia-Pacific Q4 2025: On A Jagged Course.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cfrontloading\u201d of exports and resilient domestic consumption have supported the region\u2019s growth in 2025. However, slower trade will start materializing in fourth-quarter 2025 as effects of tariffs start to unfold. Consequently, we expect Asia-Pacific\u2019s growth to slow to 4.4% in 2025 and 4.0% in 2026.\n\nThis combined with other risks could lead to reversals in market sanguinity and easy financing conditions.\n\n\u201cAbundant liquidity, narrowing spreads, and steady yields have desensitized markets to tail risks. Should shock events occur, a significant correction may occur in asset prices such as bonds, equity, and real estate,\u201d said Eunice Tan, head of Asia-Pacific credit research at S&P Global Ratings.\n\nChina\u2019s growth is squeezed on both sides. Externally, high U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will limit export competitiveness. At home, the sticky property crisis is weighing on households while \u201cinvolution\u201d\u2013cut-throat price competition\u2013is squeezing corporate margins in some consumer-facing niches. More policy stimulus may be needed to restore confidence and support economic growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the weak U.S. dollar is giving central banks in Asia-Pacific more wiggle room on monetary policy.\n\n\u201cFinancing conditions will likely benefit from the Federal Reserve\u2019s more dovish stance around interest rates,\u201d said Ms. Tan. \u201cThe reduction in interest burdens will alleviate cash flow strains, and cheaper mortgages should free up disposable income for consumption. This provides relief for heavily indebted borrowers.\u201d"

It is a grave conclusion with far-reaching consequences for international law and for the global community. For Sri Lanka, which has long affirmed support for Palestine, the moment raises many questions. Can we speak more forcefully? What prevents us? And how might our own history figure into our current posture?\n\nA recent article published in the Sri Lanka Guardian argued that anti-Semitism is on the rise in Sri Lanka. It suggested that anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli sentiments function as a single ideology, and that this supposed trend in Sri Lanka \u201cshould be interpreted as an ideological endorsement of global Islamic extremism\u201d.\n\nSuch articles and efforts to legitimise critiques of Israel\u2019s policy are not uncommon. From a certain perspective, one may even find them bold in attempting to defend an increasingly morally untenable position. From a more analytical lens, however, one could see such efforts as instruments of soft power. They shape perceptions, frame narratives, and create hesitancy in how issues are later discussed in public. It is against this backdrop that warnings of anti-Semitism were raised, even as criticism of Israeli actions intensified globally.\n\nThe conflation of criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism is a central problem. Anti-Semitism is real, corrosive, and unacceptable. Yet equating opposition to the policies of the State of Israel with hatred of Jewish people is analytically flawed and politically counterproductive. It delegitimises genuine critique and shields a state from accountability under international law.\n\nSri Lanka must be able to draw this distinction clearly. Otherwise, accusations of anti-Semitism will be used to silence debate, as has increasingly happened in Western societies. That cannot be allowed to limit our own discussions."

That cannot be allowed to limit our own discussions.\n\nThe second obstacle is diplomatic and economic. Despite its official pro-Palestine stance, Sri Lanka maintains robust ties with Israel. Workers are sent there for employment, trade relations exist, and diplomatic contacts continue. Officials argue that to condemn Israel too strongly risks economic cost. Yet moral positions cannot always be traded for short term benefits. If Sri Lanka is to uphold principles of international justice, particularly in wake of the systemic shift that the State wants to live up to, it cannot remain paralysed by fear of economic retaliation.\n\nThe third obstacle lies in domestic politics and media framing. Officials often emphasise balanced diplomacy, urging caution in language that might inflame communal tensions. Segments of our society may wonder if there is an overt hypocrisy in condemning Israel, while being reticent about exploring domestic accountability. Others still may preach insularism, and ask why the Government wishes to immerse itself in \u2018someone else\u2019s rubbish\u2019. Such practices cultivate self-censorship and reinforce the perception that certain subjects are taboo. If we are to strengthen our democracy, such hesitation must be avoided, as it weakens society\u2019s moral voice and leaves foreign policy captive to fear.\n\nThe fourth obstacle is the inertia of diplomatic culture. Even when international bodies make strong findings, the Sri Lankan bureaucracy often prefers vague language. They cite respect for procedure, the desire to avoid isolating allies, or the risk of disrupting bilateral relations. In practice this means Sri Lanka issues general calls for peace while avoiding the precise legal terms that give those calls weight.\n\nThe consequences of silence or softening of position are significant."

In practice this means Sri Lanka issues general calls for peace while avoiding the precise legal terms that give those calls weight.\n\nThe consequences of silence or softening of position are significant.\n\nSri Lanka also risks losing diplomatic credibility. For decades, our support of Palestine has been consistent. To retreat at the very moment when the world is waking up to the severity of events in Gaza makes that history look hollow. We would be perceived as unable or unwilling to act on principles we have long proclaimed.\n\nSilence also deprives Sri Lanka of the chance to redefine its own legacy. The concern that speaking about Gaza might invite comparisons to Sri Lanka\u2019s past should be inverted. By speaking clearly about the present, we demonstrate that we value accountability and justice in all contexts. Our own history does not need to be erased or excused. It can be acknowledged honestly, while still affirming that what is unfolding in Gaza is of a magnitude that meets legal thresholds that were not applied to Sri Lanka, and deserves to be called by its name.\n\nThe way forward lies in combining clarity with responsibility. With the UN General Assembly well underway, there is potential for both the President and Foreign Minister to articulate a stronger policy position for Sri Lanka.\n\nFirst, Sri Lanka should adopt precise language when referring to Gaza. If the UN Commission has found genocide, we should cite that finding directly. To do so is not to make a new allegation ourselves but to stand with established international law."

To do so is not to make a new allegation ourselves but to stand with established international law.\n\nThird, Sri Lanka should ground its statements in legal authority. The Genocide Convention, International Court of Justice proceedings, and UN Human Rights Council debates are available tools. This ensures that our voice is not rhetorical but principled, and able to carry weight. Acknowledging global injustices does not erase the need for our own self-reflection, but it shows a willingness to apply principles universally.\n\nFourth, we should use multilateral forums to press our case. Whether in the UN, the G77, the Non-Aligned Movement, or in cooperation with states that have already spoken strongly, Sri Lanka can reinforce global momentum. This would also support in preserving our relations with states, rather through unilateral confrontation.\n\nFifth, the Government should support civil society and free media at home. Journalists should not be threatened for reporting on Gaza. Youth should not be intimidated for protesting. Exchanges and visits organised by foreign governments should be transparent and subject to scrutiny. Only then will debate remain free and credible.\n\nFinally, Sri Lanka should ensure policy consistency. Public statements must be matched by tangible actions. This could include humanitarian assistance for Palestinians, diplomatic support in international fora, and careful evaluation of how labour or economic relations with Israel are structured.\n\nSri Lanka has the capacity to speak with clarity. Our historic support for Palestine gives us legitimacy. Our place in the global South gives us voice. The finding by the United Nations that genocide is occurring in Gaza is an inflection point. To remain muted at such a time would weaken our foreign policy."

The real test lies in creating systems that deliver food safety, preserve shelf life, and meet consumer convenience, all while being environmentally responsible. What matters now is how packaging performs across its entire lifecycle: from raw material sourcing and production to disposal and reuse. That\u2019s where real impact begins.\n\nSri Lanka is at a critical juncture. With food, agriculture, and tourism reorienting towards export-led growth, sustainability has shifted from being a \u201cnice-to-have\u201d to a decisive competitive advantage. International buyers are increasingly favouring partners who can demonstrate environmental accountability across their supply chains, and packaging has become a central component of that assessment. For Sri Lanka, embedding sustainable packaging practices today is about building a national brand around ethical and responsible production. This is an opening for the country to lead rather than follow.\n\nMarkets such as Malaysia and the UAE are already demonstrating how sustainable packaging can be a differentiator for exporters. Recyclable mono-materials, compostable trays, plant-based bioplastics, and water-based inks have gone mainstream. But for Sri Lanka, the path forward is not to mimic.

The road provides access to key tourist sites such as the Sinharaja Forest, Maduwanwela Walawwa, Waulpane caves, Gongala, Hadapanagala, Buluthota waterfalls, and Himidiri Plains, and the upgrade is expected to improve connectivity and support the regional tourism economy.\n\nThe Ambilipitiya\u2013Panamura\u2013Buluthota project will be implemented in two stages, drawing on the OPEC loan balance first, followed by Treasury funding to close the gap.\n\nOn the expressway network, Dr. Jayatissa said the Cabinet had also approved the renovation of a 19 km stretch of the Southern Expressway between Kottawa and Dodangoda.\n\nThe expressway opened in 2011 has not undergone major repairs in more than a decade.\n\nThe Government has identified the rehabilitation of the first 34 km of the expressway as a priority, dividing the work into two phases: 0\u201319 km and 19\u201334 km.\n\nThe first phase covering the first 19 km stretch has been put out to tender, with five bids submitted under national competitive bidding."

He brings a wealth of insight into the vocational training landscape in both Singapore and Australia. He also shares valuable perspectives drawn from his role on the External Advisory Committee for the practical undergraduate degree programs at Western Sydney University.\n\nEvery compelling professional article begins with a spark, and mine was a simple yet striking question from a colleague: \u201cWhy are Sri Lankan domestic helpers paid significantly less than those from the Philippines?\u201d Without waiting for an answer, he pointed to a key factor: vocational training. In the Philippines, domestic workers undergo structured, hands-on training in simulated household environments, covering everything from appliance use and cleaning techniques to childcare, emergency response, and etiquette. This comprehensive preparation makes them job-ready and justifies the higher wages they command.\n\nThis insight prompted me to explore the broader role of vocational education in workforce readiness. With an engineering background and a commitment to lifelong learning including postgraduate studies, management diplomas, and TAFE Certificate III and IV qualifications I have seen firsthand how non-traditional education pathways can strengthen career outcomes.\n\nThis piece aims to highlight the transformative power of vocational education and advocate for its role in building a skilled, competitive workforce."

These individuals, often trained through vocational pathways, possess specialised skills in high-demand sectors such as IT, healthcare, and advanced manufacturing. They may not hold university degrees, but their certifications and competencies are globally valued.\n\nFor Sri Lanka, embracing this model is not just pragmatic; it is a strategic move. With the right training and internationally benchmarked qualifications, Sri Lankan youth can access better-paying jobs both locally and abroad, avoiding the trap of low-skilled labour migration.\n\nAustralia\u2019s TAFE system offers a nationally consistent, publicly funded framework for vocational education. Aligned with the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF), TAFE ensures that credentials are stackable, transferable, and internationally recognised."

    "chunk_text": "NPP Government\u2019s shamelessness over Gaza\n\nWhat is glaring, however, is just how completely the NPP has capitulated\n\nAmong the hopes many had for the NPP Government when it was elected one year ago was that it would move Sri Lanka to actually opposing the devastating genocide Israel was carrying out against the Palestinian people in Gaza. What the NPP Government has gone on to do since then has been the opposite. A look at its positions on Palestine, its actions while in Government and its own past unearths a shamelessness which all Sri Lankans must contend with.\n\nDuring his pestilent, unelected presidency, Ranil Wickremesinghe had folded Sri Lanka over completely for Israel, signing agreements to \u2018export\u2019 Sri Lankan workers, opening new consulates in Israel, and embarrassingly, supporting US Red Sea naval operations against the Houthis. The newly elected Government, however, was comprised of some of the most vocal supporters of Palestine in Sri Lanka. The JVP, the NPP\u2019s main constituent party, had consistently condemned Israeli aggression against Palestinians, including after this latest phase of genocide began in October 2023. It was not false hope to believe that they would reverse Sri Lanka\u2019s position, even slightly.\n\nInstead, what has transpired since then has been an appalling doubling down. Since September 2024, the Government has expanded its agreements with Israel to send over even more Sri Lankans to fill the labour shortages created by Israel\u2019s expulsion of Palestinian workers. The Government also continues to promote Sri Lanka as a tourist destination to Israelis, including by waiving visa fees, when many of them arrive here after serving in the Israeli Defence Forces and having likely committed war crimes in Gaza."

    "chunk_text": "After signalling this surrender, to then turn around and pretend to support Palestine is what makes the NPP\u2019s stance truly shameless. Perhaps as an indebted and powerless third world country, we really cannot have any dignity \u2013 to have any economic independence and to oppose imperialist, genocidal violence \u2013 and must instead endanger and persecute our own citizens to signal our submission. That we had to learn this lesson from the JVP is ironic on so many levels.\n\nThe Government\u2019s position about the JVP\u2019s role in the war has been to not speak of it and hope it goes away, just as it no doubt hopes Israel would wrap up its genocide of Palestinians quickly. But its actions speak beyond its silence, in both Sri Lanka and in Palestine. For two years, we have watched the most horrifying, barbaric violences being inflicted on Palestinians, a relentless series of atrocities each more unimaginable than the last. Every day, images of lifeless, destroyed Palestinian bodies fill our screens as emaciated others beg for help to survive. It should fill us all with deep shame that we have not been able to stop any of this. It should fill all Sri Lankans with as deep a shame to have a Government as shameless as this."

    "chunk_text": "Who cries for Hambantota, and why?\n\nHambantota is not merely an alternative; it is a practical solution to systemic inefficiencies in Sri Lanka\u2019s current LPG supply chain\n\nThis article is written to set the record straight in response to misleading narratives about the recent Litro Gas tender. It is not about protecting one company\u2019s interest, but about revealing how Hambantota, if rationally utilised, can deliver long-overdue benefits to Sri Lanka\u2019s economy and people.\n\nFor time immemorial, Sri Lanka has been a decisive node in global trade. From the days of the Silk Route, Ceylon\u2014as it was then called\u2014connected East and West. Historical records from the Godawaya port in Hambantota show how this southern coast played a role in international trade centuries ago. After 75 years of independence, despite every Government repeating Hambantota\u2019s location-specific advantage as an election slogan, little was done to convert that advantage into real economic prosperity.\n\nFor more than two decades, successive Governments in Sri Lanka have spoken of making the country an \u201cenergy hub of the Indian Ocean.\u201d It has been an easy slogan to roll off the tongue in Budget speeches, election manifestos, and policy documents. Yet, when we examine the record, very little has been achieved in practice. No new refinery has been built, no LNG terminal has been established, and no major strategic hydrocarbon storage project has been delivered. Instead, Sri Lanka has spent nearly twenty years locked in cycles of negotiations with so-called investors that ended in disappointment."

No new refinery has been built, no LNG terminal has been established, and no major strategic hydrocarbon storage project has been delivered. Instead, Sri Lanka has spent nearly twenty years locked in cycles of negotiations with so-called investors that ended in disappointment.\n\nThe demand curve reinforces this with India consuming 33 million metric tons annually, Bangladesh surging from 70,000 tons in 2010 to 1.7 million tons today, Pakistan importing half of its 1.2 million tons annual demand, Sri Lanka consuming around 420,000 tons with among the highest per capita levels in the region, and the Maldives recording the world\u2019s highest per capita consumption of LPG despite its small size. Against this backdrop, Hambantota is not a parochial investment. It is a regional necessity.\n\nInto this vacuum of political promises stepped LAUGFS Gas, a homegrown Sri Lankan energy brand with a history of courage. At a time when multinational giants like Shell dominated the LPG trade, LAUGFS broke the monopoly and secured space for local enterprise. No downstream LPG player can survive without an import terminal. LAUGFS recognised early that Sri Lanka\u2019s energy future\u2014and its own\u2014depended on building large-scale infrastructure. What set the company apart was its willingness to risk capital and pioneer at Hambantota, even when others hesitated.\n\nIn 2018, LAUGFS commissioned one of the largest LPG import and export terminals in South Asia. It did so without political patronage, relying on entrepreneurial drive and international credibility. That investment remains unmatched by any private Sri Lankan energy company."

It did so without political patronage, relying on entrepreneurial drive and international credibility. That investment remains unmatched by any private Sri Lankan energy company.\n\nThe benefits to Sri Lanka are multi-dimensional. Large Very Large Gas Carrier (VLGC) cargoes deliver lower premiums than smaller shipments into Colombo, directly reducing import costs. With more than 30,000 metric tons of static storage, Hambantota strengthens energy security by providing buffer stocks against disruptions. By re-exporting, Sri Lanka can earn hard currency instead of bleeding it, and through control over storage and logistics the country gains greater resilience against global shocks. This vision, if realised, could position Sri Lanka in the same league as Singapore or Fujairah\u2014small states leveraging geography to punch above their weight.\n\nThe Hambantota LPG terminal, owned by LAUGFS Terminals Ltd., is an $ 80+ million investment with advanced design. It includes over 30,000 metric tons of storage with further expansion potential, berths capable of handling the largest VLGCs, transshipment infrastructure for re-export cargoes, and modern safety and environmental systems that comply with international standards. Its integration with Hambantota Port\u2019s deep-draft facilities ensures economies of scale unmatched in Sri Lanka.\n\nBy contrast, Litro\u2019s Kerawalapitiya terminal has only 8,000 metric tons of storage capacity and cannot berth VLGCs, forcing multiple costly smaller shipments. This structural limitation entrenches higher costs for the state-owned entity and, ultimately, for consumers."

This structural limitation entrenches higher costs for the state-owned entity and, ultimately, for consumers.\n\nBy contrast, Hambantota eliminates these risks. It can berth the largest VLGCs at a dedicated jetty, while LPG transported inland by road or even cylinder filling at Hambantota itself would reduce logistic costs significantly. This underscores that Hambantota is not merely an alternative; it is a practical solution to systemic inefficiencies in Sri Lanka\u2019s current LPG supply chain.\n\nThe current controversy stems from a simple clause in Litro\u2019s tender: allowing suppliers to use Hambantota. Critics paint this as favouritism. In reality, it is economic rationality.\n\nAt import volumes of 25,000\u201335,000 MT per month, the annual savings reach $ 17\u201324 million. This is not a minor margin\u2014it is a national economic benefit. By enabling suppliers to use Hambantota, Litro opens the door to lower premiums, larger cargoes, and thus cheaper LPG for consumers.\n\nThose who cry \u201cconflict of interest\u201d ignore international practice. Shared infrastructure is standard in modern energy markets. In Europe, multiple LNG and LPG traders share common regasification terminals. In India, Aegis Vopak operates common-user terminals that handle the majority of imports. In the United States, pipelines and storage hubs are shared across dozens of energy firms. Even Sri Lanka\u2019s petroleum sector operates under the same principle, with the Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited serving all downstream players. Allowing competitors to use Hambantota is not a scandal; it is best practice."

The reasons are extraordinary, not structural. The terminal was commissioned in 2018, only for the COVID-19 pandemic to disrupt global trade soon after. Sri Lanka\u2019s own economic crisis between 2020 and 2022 saw severe foreign exchange shortages that prevented letters of credit. Country credit downgrades caused banks to refuse financing imports. Bangladesh, one of the main target markets, suffered its own economic crisis. Domestic political instability compounded investor hesitation.\n\nThis perfect storm of global and local crises clipped Hambantota\u2019s wings. None of these negate the terminal\u2019s underlying economic rationale. With stability returning, Hambantota can deliver on its promise."

Facts, however, remain stubborn. Hambantota saves money. Hambantota enhances security. Hambantota earns foreign exchange. Hambantota belongs to Sri Lanka.\n\nSri Lanka has wasted decades in rhetoric about becoming an energy hub. Hambantota offers a second chance. If fully utilised, it can save up to $ 30 million annually in foreign exchange, generate re-export earnings from neighbouring markets, secure the nation\u2019s energy needs, and provide competitively priced LPG to households and industries.\n\nThe real choice is stark: either embrace Hambantota\u2019s promise or remain captive to corrupt cartels. So, who cries for Hambantota and why? Those who profited from the old system. But for every Sri Lankan household struggling to afford cooking gas, Hambantota is not a rival\u2019s asset\u2014it is a national asset.\n\n(The writer is the Founder and Chairman of LAUGFS Gas PLC, with over 30 years of experience in the LPG mid- and downstream business.

The Navy will also be responsible for storing firearms, ammunition and other equipment belonging to such companies in its armouries, and for transporting the weapons and equipment as required.\n\nAccording to the order, these duties will be carried out under the supervision of the Defence Ministry, with vehicles or vessels provided by local representatives of the foreign firms, and will be classified as non-naval duties.\n\nThe President informed Parliament of the decision in line with statutory requirements under the Navy Act.\n\nSince 2012 the Navy had facilitated the storage and transfer of weapons for private security providers through semi-State companies. These entities, such as the Avant Garde Maritime Services Ltd., acted as intermediaries, generating revenue but also drawing controversy over accountability and transparency.\n\nWhile the Navy played an operational role, the framework rested on contractual arrangements rather than a direct statutory mandate.\n\nUnder the new directive, the Navy\u2019s role is explicitly expanded to cover not only storage and transfer of weapons but also the operational, administrative and financial management of the entire project."

A search of the premises turned up about 10 kilograms of crystal methamphetamine, known as Ice, together with a lorry and a motorcycle.\n\nA second lorry, found near a service station in Tangalle, contained the bulk of the narcotics haul. Police said it concealed more than 200 kilograms of methamphetamine and heroin, as well as five revolvers and a T-56 assault rifle.\n\nYesterday, police located a third lorry in Tangalle suspected of transporting drugs. The vehicle is now being examined.\n\nOne suspect has been arrested and efforts are under way to apprehend another. Investigations into the deaths and the narcotics network are continuing."

The upcoming 2025 UN Global Compact\u2013Accenture CEO Study reveals that 66% of CEOs remain strongly committed to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). CEOs are increasingly refusing to wait for perfect conditions; instead, they are acting despite uncertainty, recognising that delay heightens risk and erodes long-term value.

It reflects a recognition that Sri Lankan companies, while operating in a small market, play a vital role in addressing challenges that transcend borders \u2013 from sustainable agriculture and food systems to digital inclusion and climate adaptation.\n\nSince its inception, the UN Private Sector Forum has been a unique platform where business leaders, heads of state, and senior UN officials engage in candid dialogue on how to accelerate progress toward shared goals. Unlike other global summits, the PSF is not just a stage for commitments \u2013 it is a working roundtable where ideas are exchanged, solutions proposed, and partnerships forged.\n\nThe 2025 edition will focus specifically on unlocking private capital for sustainable and inclusive growth. With trillions of dollars required annually to meet the SDGs, the Forum will explore how businesses can align investments with global priorities such as climate action, food security, digital innovation, and more, resonating deeply with Sri Lanka\u2019s national development priorities.\n\nNetwork Sri Lanka\u2019s participation at the UN PSF is more than an international appearance \u2013 it is a signal that Sri Lanka is engaging with the world at a critical juncture, determined to contribute to and benefit from the global transition toward sustainability."

    "chunk_text": "Public Rights Movement raises alarm over Litro tender changes, calls for probe\n\nThe National Movement for the Protection of Public Rights has voiced strong concern over recent changes made to Litro Gas Lanka\u2019s tender process for importing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), warning that the move could undermine the profitability of the State-owned enterprise (SOE) and compromise national energy security.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) Director-General, Movement Convener Charaka Thilakaratne alleged that a key clause in previous tender documents had been removed without proper authorisation. The clause had prohibited Litro from using storage facilities owned by competing suppliers to store imported gas reserves, a safeguard long considered essential to prevent market manipulation in the critical gas sector.\n\n\u201cLitro, which played a vital role during the recent economic crisis, has been one of the few profitable SOEs in recent years. Its success stood as an example of how public enterprises can function without being a burden on the taxpayer,\u201d the letter noted. The Movement warned that the removal of the clause would carry far-reaching consequences, including eroding Litro\u2019s profitability, weakening State control over domestic gas prices, and enabling private competitors to gain market dominance.\n\nIt also charged that the tender changes were made after the announcement without approval from the Cabinet, Parliament, or a duly authorised committee. \u201cThis raises serious questions of corruption. It appears that decisions are being taken to intentionally benefit private players at the expense of the State and the public,\u201d they charged.\n\nThe Movement charged the Government of inconsistency, pointing out that it had repeatedly pledged to safeguard public ownership and control in the energy sector, while allegedly allowing practices that could hand disproportionate influence to private firms."

Hence, AKD Government which is bent on making a digital transformation of the Sri Lanka economy is correct in its action to setup an outfit that will monitor the work of the key institutions day and night and prevent cyber attackers from destroying the system\n\nLast week, President Anura Kumara Disanayake, unveiling Sri Lanka\u2019s National Cyber Protection Strategy 2025-9, declared open the National Cyber Security Operations Centre or NCSOC, an outfit brought into existence by the work done by Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Team or CERT and the Ministry of Digital Economy with technical support from the World Bank.1 The objective of this outfit has been to improve the preparedness of state institutions, strengthen the capacity of CERT, protect institutions that manage critical digital infrastructure, and foster collaboration with multiple stakeholders to create a secure public cyberspace. It will provide 24-hour monitoring of 37 state institutions involved in the country\u2019s digital infrastructure such as the Departments of Immigration and Emigration, Inland Revenue, and Motor Traffic against potential cyber-attacks."

What his means is that digitisation-a process in which information in hardcopies is converted to digital form-is necessary but not sufficient to create an inclusive digital ecosystem.\n\nA further step should be taken for the digitalisation of the systems in which the digitised information is used across different sections within an organisation or across different organisations within an economy.2 This is the fundamental objective of using what is known as big data productively. If digital transformation is not allowed, digitising information in stand-alone institutions is a waste."

If digital transformation is not allowed, digitising information in stand-alone institutions is a waste.\n\nSince the digital space is rich with resources, it naturally draws the interested persons to hack the systems to gain an undue enrichment. Hence, hackers and modes of hacking are aplenty.3 Government institutions are hacked not only for money but also to embarrass the rulers through temporary stoppage of government activities. Hence, AKD Government which is bent on making a digital transformation of the Sri Lanka economy is correct in its action to setup an outfit that will monitor the work of the key institutions day and night and prevent cyber attackers from destroying the system.\n\nThis is a precautionary activity done by the Government to protect the government institutions from cyberspace crimes. It is a must, but it is necessary to protect other stakeholders too in an economy, namely, private businesses, and private individuals. This is where a supplementary work program is needed to make the system completely free from cyberspace crimes."

There is an advisory committee set up to guide the organisers as to how this fair and conference should be held. It is made-up of leading Indian bankers and headed by reputed banker CHSS Mallikarjuna Rao, former MD and CEO of the Panjab National Bank.7\n\nDevaiah tells me that the organisers welcome participants from other countries to enrich the knowledge dissemination process through cross-fertilisation of new ideas. Hence, in my view, it is good opportunity for Sri Lankan banks and insurance companies to have a foot stand in the technologically growing Indian marketplace.\n\nDevaiah tells me that technology, specifically AI technology, is being used by cyber thieves to capture technologically illiterate people to siphon off the moneys they have. This puzzles me because this is the first time I am being told that AI is being used by cyber thieves to steal money from individuals. We have been told about stories of cyber hackers attacking computer systems of large organisations, including government websites, and demanding ransoms to allow them to start operations again. Also, another undesirable side effect of AI, we are being told, is how it will have undesired consequences on income distribution and poverty levels of national economies."

    "chunk_text": "What Doha delivered: Diplomacy beyond the podium\n\nThe Doha summit stands as a potent act of collective diplomacy\n\nWhen Qatar hosted the Arab-Islamic emergency summit on 15 September 2025\u2014just days after an Israeli strike in Doha killed Hamas leaders and a Qatari officer\u2014expectations were high. Could this gathering produce more than a chorus of protest speeches? Would it reshape regional alignments, force policy shifts, or deepen legal and military responses? As the dust settles, Doha emerges as a significant diplomatic moment that combined high symbolism with cautious substance.1\n\nThe first measure of success lay in the breadth of participation. Qatar secured an impressive roster of leaders from across the Arab and Islamic worlds.2 Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Iran\u2019s President Masoud Pezeshkian, Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II, Iraq\u2019s Prime Minister Mohammed Shia\u2019 al-Sudani and Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif all arrived in person.3 For Qatar, whose sovereignty had been directly violated, such high-level attendance signalled a powerful endorsement of its grievance and a clear message of regional solidarity.\n\nEqually significant was the presence of countries that maintain formal ties with Israel. Senior delegations from the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco\u2014states that had joined the Abraham Accords\u2014added weight to the gathering.4 Their decision to endorse a communiqu\u00e9 critical of Israel and to consider a \u201creview of diplomatic and economic ties\u201d reflected a subtle but important shift in the regional conversation. By convening the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in tandem with the Gulf Cooperation Council\u2019s Supreme Council, Qatar ensured that the summit carried institutional legitimacy beyond a one-off protest meeting.5"

By convening the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in tandem with the Gulf Cooperation Council\u2019s Supreme Council, Qatar ensured that the summit carried institutional legitimacy beyond a one-off protest meeting.5\n\nThe summit\u2019s outcome document is the clearest indicator of what this diplomacy achieved. It opens with an unequivocal denunciation of the Israeli strike as a \u201cflagrant\u201d violation of Qatari sovereignty and the United Nations Charter, pledging \u201cabsolute solidarity\u201d with Doha.6 This framing elevates the incident from a dispute involving a non-state actor to a direct breach of state sovereignty\u2014precisely the legal terrain on which international action can be built.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 also calls for \u201call possible legal and effective measures\u201d against Israel, including a review of diplomatic and economic relations and support for international legal proceedings.7 The accompanying GCC statement goes further, directing the bloc\u2019s Unified Military Command to activate joint defence and deterrence mechanisms\u2014language rarely used in recent years and potentially the summit\u2019s most concrete step.8\n\nAt the same time, the document bears the marks of compromise. It contains no binding sanctions, no timelines and no collective commitment to sever ties or impose economic penalties.9 References to a political horizon and a two-state solution were retained only after careful wording, and Iran publicly distanced itself from those passages.10 Implementation remains undefined; the language provides flexibility rather than obligation."

By explicitly endorsing legal action, the summit placed Israel\u2019s actions under a sharper legal spotlight and opened pathways to the International Court of Justice or the International Criminal Court.12 At the same time, the GCC\u2019s call to enhance joint defence gives the Gulf states a framework for practical coordination, a reminder that collective security is again on the agenda after years of drift.13\n\nEvents in Washington and Doha shortly after the summit add another layer of significance. During a visit to Qatar following meetings in Israel, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reaffirmed that Washington had not approved the strike and emphasized the inviolability of Qatari sovereignty.14 Rubio warned that there was only a \u201cvery short window\u201d to achieve a Gaza ceasefire and praised Qatar\u2019s role as mediator.15 Most notably, he announced that the United States and Qatar are close to finalising an enhanced defence cooperation agreement, signalling that the US intends to deepen its military partnership with Doha in response to the attack.16\n\nThis development underscores that the summit\u2019s impact extended beyond the region. By drawing the United States into closer strategic alignment with Qatar, the Doha gathering has influenced the calculations of the very power whose ally carried out the strike."

By drawing the United States into closer strategic alignment with Qatar, the Doha gathering has influenced the calculations of the very power whose ally carried out the strike.\n\nThe agreement reverberates well beyond the Doha summit\u2019s walls. By binding the region\u2019s largest Arab economy to South Asia\u2019s only nuclear-armed state, it raises the cost of any future violation of Gulf sovereignty and points toward a more multipolar security architecture in the broader Middle East.\n\nStill, the limitations are clear. Diverging national interests remain the chief obstacle to collective action. Iran\u2019s rejection of two-state language underscores how difficult it will be to maintain unity beyond rhetorical condemnation.18 Many governments are constrained by ties to the United States and Europe, economic interdependence and domestic political considerations.19 For leaders facing their own fragile coalitions, dramatic gestures\u2014severing ties, imposing sanctions\u2014can carry steep internal costs.\n\nThe reliance on careful verbs\u2014\u201dreview,\u201d \u201cconsider,\u201d \u201cpossible measures\u201d\u2014exposes the gap between symbolism and enforcement.20 Without timelines, verification or shared mechanisms, momentum may fade and the communiqu\u00e9 may come to be seen as another strong statement without follow-through.\n\nThe true measure of Doha\u2019s success will unfold in the coming months. Signs to watch include whether the GCC\u2019s Unified Military Command moves beyond declarations into coordinated air-defence or deterrence exercises; whether states that maintain relations with Israel undertake tangible downgrades; whether Qatar or a coalition of Arab states file legal cases before international courts; and whether Washington and Doha translate the promised defence cooperation agreement into operational reality.21 External reactions\u2014including how India, Iran and Israel read the Saudi-Pakistan pact\u2014will further shape the region\u2019s strategic balance."

The uprising left vast destruction in its wake: national assets worth millions were lost, and numerous five-star hotels in Kathmandu were set ablaze. Videos flooded social media, showing enraged crowds dragging politicians through the streets while setting their homes on fire.\n\nObservers quickly drew parallels with Sri Lanka\u2019s \u201cAragalaya\u201d (Struggle) of 2022. Bangladesh too had experienced a similar upheaval, when its Prime Minister was driven to seek refuge in India.\n\nDespite their differences, these three cases\u2014Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Nepal\u2014share one defining feature: deep-seated hostility toward the political class. Anger was directed not only at those in power but also at opposition politicians. In Nepal, as in Sri Lanka, the homes of both government and opposition leaders were torched.\n\nDriving Nepal\u2019s movement was the Gen Z generation. The protests were sustained largely by digitally connected youth, some as young as 13 to 23 years old. Many were too young to vote, yet, armed only with smartphones, they became the decisive force behind regime change.\n\nThis marked the emergence of a new form of public power\u2014one that goes beyond the ballot box.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, for example, there are about 17 million registered voters, with around 14 million typically casting ballots in crucial elections. Yet, an even larger number now shapes discourse and mobilisation through the digital sphere."

Yet, an even larger number now shapes discourse and mobilisation through the digital sphere.\n\nNepali youth in particular see the rising wealth of their neighbours as proof of injustice. This sense of inequity, magnified by social media, eventually erupted into open revolt.\n\nWhat underpins these uprisings is an ideological foundation built on deception and resentment. Across South Asia, societies have been \u201cintoxicated\u201d by a narrative package of lies and hatred.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, this mindset was cultivated over 76 years since independence. The belief that politicians were looting the nation\u2019s wealth gradually became an accepted truth, spread widely through social media. Crucially, it cut across all social classes until it hardened into a universal conviction: *\u201cEvery politician is a thief.\u201d*\n\nThis same ideological drift has now swept through Bangladesh and Nepal. Once societies are armed with such a belief, every politician\u2014regardless of party\u2014is branded as someone who deserves to be attacked. The events in all three countries demonstrate this dangerous progression.\n\nThese movements also show how falsehoods and hatred can make regime change deceptively easy.\n\nIn Sri Lanka today, society expects instant development once the old conviction\u2014that \u201call politicians steal\u201d\u2014is defeated. Frustrated youth, live-streaming global events on their phones, direct their anger at local rulers, refusing to tolerate even the smallest misstep.\n\nExpectations of politicians have also shifted. It is no longer enough for them to avoid corruption. In some quarters, the demand now is that they should own *nothing at all*. This attitude has already created dilemmas for several government ministers. If normalised, it could lead to severe social distortions."

It is a living, breathing entity that discounts the future, processes the present, and is invariably haunted by the ghosts of the past. For 16 tumultuous years, the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) has been the most honest narrator of Sri Lanka\u2019s modern saga\u2014a tale of euphoric triumph, devastating despair and now become the forward barometer of Sri Lanka\u2019s economic rebirth.\n\nIn exactly one year since the Presidential elections, the ASPI has gained more than 90%, gaining 10,119 points from 10,966 to 21,085 as of 19 September 2025.\n\nMarket capitalisation has grown by 85% from Rs. 4.045 trillion to Rs. 7.479 trillion. This 3.434 trillion in wealth creation in one year, in USD terms is $ 11.4 billion, which works out to be almost four times the total bailout package by the IMF which is paid out in four years.\n\nListed companies have cumulatively brought in profits of 800 billion for the last four quarters as well.\n\nBut these numbers, impressive as they are, represent more than a rally. They signal a country positioning itself for the most decisive transformation in its modern history.\n\nWhat lies ahead is even more consequential. With the IMF program giving us much needed discipline, stability and relief, we have come out strong out of one of Sri Lanka\u2019s worst financial crisis. Ensuring we carry on with these reforms and turning stability into growth is what we need to ensure going forward."

With the IMF program giving us much needed discipline, stability and relief, we have come out strong out of one of Sri Lanka\u2019s worst financial crisis. Ensuring we carry on with these reforms and turning stability into growth is what we need to ensure going forward.\n\nTurning the crisis around required continuity, discipline, and political commitment across three successive Governments. The administration of 2022 began tough stabilisation measures: fuel and electricity prices were aligned to cost-recovery, taxes were increased, and monetary tightening brought inflation down from its peak. The Government in 2023 continued this path, negotiating and implementing the IMF Extended Fund Facility, restructuring debt, and rebuilding reserves while maintaining fiscal discipline. By late 2024, President Anura Kumara Disanayake\u2019s administration took the reforms further, ensuring strict adherence to IMF program targets, completing successive reviews, and restoring confidence in economic governance.\n\nThe results are tangible: gross reserves rose from under $ 100 million to over $ 6 billion, the primary balance shifted to a surplus, and investor confidence returned. The economy saw eight successive quarters of growth in GDP, culminating in 4.9% as of the last quarter. The Central Bank, now firmly independent, cut policy rates, halted money printing, gave stability to the currency, all factors which helped the economy and the market to take off.\n\nUnlike previous rallies, this recovery rests not on short-term optimism but on a disciplined, multi-government implementation of structural reforms \u2014 proof that Sri Lanka can stabilise and grow even after deep crisis.\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s path to this moment was anything but linear. The CSE has lived through euphoric booms, painful crashes, and outright collapse. Each cycle carries a lesson \u2014 and together they explain why today\u2019s recovery has deeper roots."

Each cycle carries a lesson \u2014 and together they explain why today\u2019s recovery has deeper roots.\n\nPolitical change sparked bursts of market euphoria, but these were often short-lived. In 2015, the promise of good governance and international engagement lifted markets temporarily. The 2019\u20132020 period saw aggressive fiscal stimulus \u2014 VAT and income tax cuts, unfunded spending \u2014 which pushed the ASPI up by 20% in just months. Yet these gains were unsustainable: Government revenue collapsed, debt sustainability was undermined, and when COVID-19 struck, the fragile economic foundation crumbled. The key lesson is that rallies based on short-term populism, without structural reforms, leave economies vulnerable to shocks and investors exposed to avoidable risk.\n\nLesson 3: Post-COVID rallies are fragile without strong fundamentals (2020\u20132021)\n\nAfter the initial shock of COVID-19, global markets rebounded rapidly on stimulus, liquidity injections, and optimism about vaccines. Many countries sustained these rallies due to strong fiscal buffers, resilient domestic demand, and solid corporate earnings.\n\nSri Lanka, however, could not maintain its post-COVID recovery. The economy entered the pandemic with weak fundamentals: prior populist measures had hollowed out government revenue, foreign reserves were critically low, and key sectors remained vulnerable. Tourism, a major foreign exchange earner, collapsed due to border closures. Exports and industrial production were disrupted by supply chain issues. In addition, the Government\u2019s abrupt nationwide ban on chemical fertilisers and pesticides in 2021 sharply reduced agricultural output, particularly rice and tea, further depleting foreign currency earnings and driving up import costs."

In Sri Lanka, both the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent economic crisis illustrated this vividly \u2014 across multiple sectors and listed companies.\n\nHealthcare and essential services: During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals, local supermarkets, and logistics companies experienced increased demand. Companies that could efficiently supply goods and services to households and businesses found strong revenue growth, even amidst a broader economic contraction.\n\nEnergy and agriculture: Amid the economic crisis and import restrictions, energy companies gained opportunities to restructure operations and improve efficiency. Fertiliser companies profited as domestic demand shifted due to restrictions on imports, highlighting how regulatory or policy changes can create temporary advantages for domestic producers.\n\nManufacturing and exports: Import restrictions boosted sectors producing tiles, cables, and other essential manufactured goods, while exporters benefited from currency depreciation and global demand. Companies earning foreign currency or operating internationally saw windfalls as the rupee weakened."

Rupee depreciation and inflation increased construction costs, while land and property revaluation lifted asset bases for listed real estate companies.\n\nPolicy and regulatory environment: As VAT and corporate taxes were rationalised and enforced, an even playing field emerged, favouring listed companies with stronger compliance and transparency, giving them competitive advantages over smaller or informal operators.\n\nWhile many of these opportunities may be temporary, their impact is lasting. Short-term gains in revenue or profit often translate into improved cash flows, stronger balance sheets, and greater operational flexibility, putting listed companies in a much better position to weather future challenges.

Fiscal discipline, debt restructuring, and monetary prudence have rebuilt reserves and stabilised the currency.

Improved tax collection, broader coverage of VAT and corporate taxes, and stricter compliance enforcement have created a more level playing field for companies operating in the formal economy."

Sri Lanka\u2019s AI dilemma beyond AKD\u2019s binary\n\nA binary \u201cdigitalise or perish\u201d narrative must give way to a measured path\n\nPresident Anura Kumara Disanayake has cast digital transformation as a stark binary: either embrace artificial intelligence (AI) and modernise, or be \u201cpushed to the margins\u201d of the global economy. His appeal identifies inefficiency, stagnation, and weak public services as consequences of past inaction. This rhetoric mirrors global leaders who treat AI as a \u201cpillar\u201d of competitiveness and a survival imperative.\n\nYet such framing is both motivational and reductionist.

Under the IMF program, Government must run primary surpluses and push public debt down from roughly 110% of GDP toward 80\u201385% by 20323, 4. In such a setting, every rupee funnelled into prestige digital projects crowds out what is urgently needed to cushion disruption: unemployment protection, retraining, and sectoral transition support. But Sri Lanka has no nationwide unemployment insurance yet, and more than half of the poorest citizens were not covered by safety nets even during the crisis\u2014evidence that administrative fixes and \u201csmart targeting\u201d do not magically create buffers where fiscal capacity is thin5.\n\nGuardrails are also late. The Personal Data Protection Act only began full enforcement in March 2025; institutions, capacity and independence still need to mature before large biometric or AI systems are expanded6. Meanwhile, energy intensive data centres and AI infrastructure face tariff volatility: a 15% electricity hike in June 2025 underlines the recurrent cost risk to Government and SMEs alike7.\n\nThe policy implication is sequencing, not speed: build legal safeguards, labour protections, and human capital first; target digital spend to high-value domestic problems (health, agriculture, logistics) with open standards and clear exit options. Otherwise digitalisation risks deepening inequality while adding hard recurrent costs to a debt-burdened state."

Petitions filed by former Minister Wimal Weerawansa and civil society activists allege that the deal jeopardises Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereignty and exposes citizens\u2019 biometric data to foreign misuse8.\n\nThe Supreme Court has issued notice to the President and Cabinet, recognising at least a prima facie concern. This controversy highlights the danger of \u201cmodernisation by outsourcing\u201d: in digital governance, whoever controls the database controls the citizen.\n\nAnother overlooked risk is employment. Sri Lanka has marketed itself as a destination for call centres and back office outsourcing. Yet advances in AI voice agents, customer service chatbots, and automated translation threaten to erase this industry.\n\nThe paradox is cruel: while Colombo may trumpet digitalisation as a source of new jobs, global AI firms headquartered in California, London, or Bangalore are already automating these very functions. Sri Lanka has little leverage to regulate these giants or shield its workforce. For thousands of young urban workers, the dream of digital employment could become a nightmare of redundancy.\n\nPresident Disanayake frequently highlights foreign examples of digitalisation: fishermen abroad using mobile signals to locate schools of fish, or farmers applying digital forecasts to guide crop cycles. Yet these narratives obscure the actual burdens of Sri Lankan farmers and fisherfolk."

I have politely declined to be involved as a keynote speaker or as the chief guest in several such \u201csuspected\u201d events. Today\u2019s column is all about awards, rewards, and swards.\n\nA \u201csward\u201d is a portion of ground covered with grass, or the grassy surface of the dull looking land, in making it nice looking. What is the relevance of it to award ceremonies? The final showcasing of several reputed leaders who undisputedly deserving accolades whilst inserting several \u201cpaid participants\u201d on the equal footing is something one can observe in some so-called elegant events. It is in a way to cover the \u201cdull soil\u201d of haphazardly organising an award ceremony with the \u201cgrass surface\u201d of popularly known veterans. I must be truly clear that my intention is not to sling mud at any individual or institution, but to bring a timely topic of the town to the limelight.\n\nAs the fundamentals of organisational behaviour tell us, rewards (both financial and non-financial) can be a way of motivating people. An award in many recent local ceremonies is typically a non-financial reward involving a trophy, plaque, or any other monument together with a certificate. In a true technical sense, it is an example of \u201cextrinsic motivation\u201d where one is excited by an external reward, a mechanism to motivate individuals, interactive teams as well as institutions.\n\nIn perusing the web, I came across several suspected ways of enticing people to receive an award.\n\nUnsolicited congratulations: You receive a congratulatory message out of the blue for a particular award or ranking.\n\nWebsite badges and certificates: The award is presented as an HTML badge or winner\u2019s certificate, often with a fee attached."

Also, the organisation might be highly unresponsive to one\u2019s inquiries, or one must painfully chase them for updates.\n\nI have come across several such cases in Sri Lanka where giving awards has become a key financial reward for the organisers. The challenge I have is when a person known to me and seeks my advice whether to accept an award from a relatively lesser-known organisation with no formal assessment or evaluation or at least a discussion involved. The ways of checking the credibility of some such \u201cattractively arranged\u201d award ceremonies are also not clear. At times, I wonder whether some have discovered a lucrative revenue stream of \u201cconducing award ceremonies.\u201d\n\nMy point is quite simple. There must be a professionally-designed, transparent process in place to select the truly deserving winners. Typically, it should involve, technical evaluation, objective judging, and assurance of the overall process. If not, the reputation of those who involved will be possibly at stake. What is required is not to curse the darkness but to light a candle. Whilst acknowledging the presence of several professionally conducted award ceremonies, let me share my authentic experience in one event as the Co-chair of the panel of judges in ensuring highest professional standards."

    "chunk_text": "My point is quite simple. There must be a professionally-designed, transparent process in place to select the truly deserving winners. Typically, it should involve, technical evaluation, objective judging, and assurance of the overall process. If not, the reputation of those who involved will be possibly at stake. What is required is not to curse the darkness but to light a candle. Whilst acknowledging the presence of several professionally conducted award ceremonies, let me share my authentic experience in one event as the Co-chair of the panel of judges in ensuring highest professional standards.\n\nWith the right leadership at all levels, crafting and executing strategy begins. An enterprise is expected to have exemplary governance. Ensuring the needed elements such as capacity building, performance management, having local and global market reach, focus on environment, society and governance, would lead to excellent business and financial results. The much-acclaimed framework of NBEA captures all the above as seven key elements depicted as a marking scheme of 1000 points. I remember with gratitude all previous chairs of the panel of judges, who have continuously improved the scheme of recognition with enhanced transparency and accuracy.\n\nBased on the published details, the four main objectives of the NBEA can be stated as follows:\n\n1. To recognise and reward those organisations that have excelled in all-round performance\n\n2. To recognise and reward enterprises that have excelled in each of the excellent criteria such as Corporate Governance, Capacity Building, Performance Management, Global and Local Market Reach, Corporate Social Responsibility & Environmental Sustainability, and Business and Financial Results\n\n3. To encourage Sri Lankan organisations to emulate those excellent organisations"

To encourage Sri Lankan organisations to emulate those excellent organisations\n\nAny registered business organisation domiciled in Sri Lanka which has been in operation for a minimum period of three years prior to the date of application is eligible to apply. Divisions, units, estates, factories, etc. of organisations, unless they are legal entities by themselves, are not eligible. Also, the overall Gold award winner of the previous year is not eligible to apply for the immediately succeeding three years. We were aware that the Co- chairs of the Panel of Judges are the sole and final deciding authority regarding the evaluation procedures and on the recipients of the awards.\n\nAs the NCC states, all award winners will be permitted to use the award logo on their promotional material for a period of three years from the date of winning the award. Also, every winning enterprise is to be listed in the virtual hall of fame hosted on the website dedicated to the National Business Excellence Awards until next National Business Awards Ceremony. Further, winners will be included in the Chamber\u2019s automated mailing list and will be entitled to receive all Chamber journals, newsletters, and other communications in the preceding year.\n\nSince there were only a limited number of awards, all others who competed will be invited to participate in a seminar, after the event, on how they could better prepare themselves for the next National Business Excellence Awards competition."

The tiered base symbolised the initial ascent of the business ladder from the formative stages of a company\u2019s life where an input of much dedication and hard work would have been observed. Rapid growth would have followed to the upper levels of the ladder in terms of quality and fame as denoted by the pillar of the trophy.\n\nThe intricate details go even further. The pillar tops out to an inverted set of steps where the landing depicts stability. This supports an intricately handcrafted lotus blossom with hand embossed petals of traditional motifs. The inverted sets of steps are created to symbolise the stupendous effort needed to rise to the very top akin to climbing an overhang of rock on a mountain face. The summit contains the previously mentioned lotus bloom in all its splendour denoting the purity, prosperity, fame, and glory that the business houses which have reached the highest levels of excellence enjoy.\u201d\n\nWe could observe an evolved framework tested and proven over years is being used for evaluation. It covers the following salient features, as depicted below:\n\nLeadership and strategy: As a key driver for other deliverables, this is seen as the start for excellence.\n\nCorporate governance: Successful institutionalisation of corporate governance with needed compliances were expected.\n\nCapacity building: Capital investment and other initiatives to create capacity for future growth were looked into. Investing in people and technology both were considered\n\nPerformance management: Successful implementation of best practices in performance management was investigated."

The Main Awards for overall excellence included Gold, Silver, and Bronze. Winner and Runner Up were selected for Criteria Awards inclusive of capacity building, performance management etc. The Category Awards (Winner, 1st Runner Up, and 2nd Runner Up) were selected from Micro, Small, Medium, and Large sectors. The Sector Awards (Winner and 1st Runner Up) were the broadest covering a large number of sectors including agriculture and plantations, banking, construction, gem and jewellery, healthcare and related services, hospitality and tourism, ICT services, insurance, printing and related services, non-banking and financial services, infrastructure and utilities, trading, education and many other sectors.\n\nAs was the practice, there was a technical team who evaluated each of the application submitted using a 1000-point scheme.

The traditional expectation that rulers should mirror their own values, backgrounds, and mannerisms faces a rupture as society increasingly values qualities of integrity, transparency, and empathy. Instead of popularist theatrics or superficial image-building, the new leadership embodies a character shaped by years of learning, community experience, and a resolute commitment to the welfare of all Sri Lankans."

The traditional expectation that rulers should mirror their own values, backgrounds, and mannerisms faces a rupture as society increasingly values qualities of integrity, transparency, and empathy. Instead of popularist theatrics or superficial image-building, the new leadership embodies a character shaped by years of learning, community experience, and a resolute commitment to the welfare of all Sri Lankans.\n\n\u201cElite Displacement Syndrome\u201d describes the reaction of entrenched elites who suddenly lose their privileges when a corrupt system is dismantled. In Sri Lanka, this is visible today as once-powerful political families, their business allies, and loyal media supporters find themselves side-lined. Their properties, bank accounts, and networks, long shielded from scrutiny, are now under the eyes of investigators. Many fear losing the patronage system that kept them safe for decades.\n\nTake any district. Look at the wealth accumulated by certain political families, their houses, vehicles, land, and overseas assets and connections. Ordinary Sri Lankans survived hunger, malnutrition, and lack of proper schools or hospitals, while these elites celebrated with banquets, foreign tours, and tax-funded extravagance. Doctors still treat children for malnutrition, while politicians once wasted public resources on luxury lifestyles. This injustice went on for decades. Now, people demand accountability. Bringing those who looted the country to justice is not revenge it is justice owed to the millions who paid the price through poverty and lost opportunities. Without accountability, reforms risk being weakened by backlash from these same elites."

A section of the business community also kept the system alive by partnering with corrupt politicians. For decades, businesses flourished by taking state loans they never repaid, hiding money in fake ventures, creating monopolies in essentials or bribing officials to secure contracts. Public banks were drained, consumer confidence destroyed, yet private profits kept flowing. In many cases, politicians and business owners became silent partners in each other\u2019s thefts.\n\nThat era is ending.

    "chunk_text": "On Reconciliation: Listening To India Is Always Good For Sri Lanka\n\nAs speculation swirls over whether Sri Lanka\u2019s National People\u2019s Power (NPP) government will hold provincial council elections next year, a bigger question looms: Will the NPP genuinely move forward with these elections, or is it preparing to abolish the provincial council system altogether, despite repeated assurances? Against this backdrop, India has once again reaffirmed its long-standing position\u2014insisting that the full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment to Sri Lanka\u2019s Constitution is crucial for the country\u2019s unity and stability. India\u2019s recent statement at the 60th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) is not mere diplomatic routine, but part of a decades-long commitment to Sri Lanka\u2019s reconciliation process.\n\nThis year, India\u2019s call was\u00a0echoed\u00a0by other influential international stakeholders, including the United Kingdom and Canada. These \u201ccore group\u201d countries jointly underscored the urgency of early provincial council elections and the further devolution of power in accordance with the Thirteenth Amendment. The message is clear: meaningful devolution and genuine reconciliation are indispensable for Sri Lanka\u2019s future.\n\nSpeaking at the UNHRC in Geneva, Anupama Singh, First Secretary at India\u2019s Permanent Mission, summed up India\u2019s enduring support: \u201cAs a close friend of Sri Lanka and an immediate neighbour with deep-rooted ties, India has remained steadfast in its support for relief, rehabilitation, resettlement, and reconstruction in Sri Lanka since 2009.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cIndia believes that meaningful devolution and genuine reconciliation, through an inclusive approach, would contribute to nation-building and durable peace. Progress in these areas will benefit all communities in Sri Lanka and reinforce the strong foundation of friendship and trust between our nations.\u201d"

Progress in these areas will benefit all communities in Sri Lanka and reinforce the strong foundation of friendship and trust between our nations.\u201d\n\nAfter intensive negotiations from 1985 to 1987, both moderate and militant Tamil factions agreed to India\u2019s proposed framework for devolution. However, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) ultimately rejected this path, charting their own violent course until their eventual military defeat in 2009. With the LTTE gone, the Indo-Lanka Accord remains the only credible foundation for lasting peace\u2014if, and only if, Sri Lanka\u2019s leaders on both sides are truly willing to bridge the country\u2019s deep-seated divides.\n\nCritics of India\u2019s involvement in Sri Lanka often argue that the Thirteenth Amendment is a purely internal matter and that outside interference is unnecessary. On the surface, this argument appears logical. Yet, it overlooks the root cause of persistent international concern: Sri Lanka\u2019s repeated failures to seize opportunities for reconciliation and its prolonged political impasse.\n\nHad the country\u2019s leaders sincerely treated the Thirteenth Amendment as a domestic issue, they would have either implemented it or replaced it with a superior solution. Their collective inaction instead highlights the shortcomings of the political elite\u2014lending legitimacy to continued external engagement."

Their collective inaction instead highlights the shortcomings of the political elite\u2014lending legitimacy to continued external engagement.\n\nIndia\u2019s position has always been consistent: resolving Sri Lanka\u2019s ethnic question is not only in India\u2019s interest\u2014it is fundamentally in Sri Lanka\u2019s own best interest. As Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar has\u00a0pointed out, \u201cIt is in Sri Lanka\u2019s own interest that the expectations of the Tamil people for equality, justice, peace and dignity within a united Sri Lanka are fulfilled. That applies equally to the commitments made by the Sri Lankan government on meaningful devolution, including the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution.\u201d\n\nFor sixteen years since the end of the war, New Delhi has encouraged Tamil parties to unite, and both sides to negotiate in good faith. Yet, no reconciliation measure as substantial as the Thirteenth Amendment has moved forward. India has also advised Tamil leaders not to make unrealistic demands\u2014such as merging the Northern and Eastern provinces\u2014acknowledging that such proposals are now \u201cwater under the bridge.\u201d\n\nThe critical question now facing Sri Lanka is whether its leaders will finally deliver on the promise of the Thirteenth Amendment, or allow history to repeat itself. Until genuine progress is made, international actors\u2014including India\u2014will continue to press for reconciliation and inclusive governance.\n\nSixteen years after the war\u2019s end, Sri Lanka has yet to achieve meaningful reconciliation with its minority Tamil population. In this context, India\u2019s message is unequivocal: Colombo should resolve the national question by implementing the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution\u2014not for India\u2019s benefit, but for Sri Lanka\u2019s own future."

Depicting every Israeli as a mass killer is an imbecile act filled with vendetta towards Israelis. Furthermore, when Russian soldiers, who are engaged in a war in Ukraine, are not being questioned when they visit Sri Lanka, it exposes the hypocrisy of their argument.\n\nThe second question critics raise is about the behavior of Israelis in tourist areas. They point to Israelis conducting prayers in Chabad houses and seeking kosher food as evidence of an expansionist attitude. This criticism is ironic and stems from a deep ignorance of Jewish culture in Sri Lanka. Just as Muslims seek halal food, Jews seek kosher food to follow the Torah and the laws of kashrut. Kosher food is part of Jewish religio-cultural identity, just as halal food is for Muslims. It is preposterous that some Muslims in Sri Lanka are suspicious of kosher food while they themselves adhere to halal food culture."

Biomedical waste left in open bins, hazardous chemicals poured down drains, and overflowing bins where plastic, paper, and food waste are all dumped together.\n\nThe gap between what policies states and how they are practiced is more than just an administrative oversight. It weakens public trust and puts communities at serious risk. When hospitals fail to dispose of biomedical waste safely, they don\u2019t just put their own staff at risk they endanger sanitation workers, patients, their families, and entire neighborhoods. When schools or universities treat waste as an afterthought, they send a message to young people that environmental safety is negotiable.\n\nFailure to manage waste is not just a regulatory issue but its being\u2019s immeasurable consequences. Proper disposal of waste is essential as improper disposal of biomedical waste can lead to contamination of nearby water sources, open dumping increases the risk of infectious diseases like hepatitis, HIV, and others among sanitation workers and waste pickers. Contaminants from industrial waste seep into soil and waterways causing long-term health problems, from breathing disorders to cancers.\n\nThe impact on environment is high and so is the cost to clean this up. Open burning produces harmful smoke that contains dioxins and other toxins and is released into the atmosphere making the air quality worse. Plastics are recyclable but due to negligence end up in rivers and eventually in the ocean polluting the water bodies. When institutions fail to manage their waste responsibly, the ripple effects extend far beyond their gates."

When institutions fail to manage their waste responsibly, the ripple effects extend far beyond their gates.\n\nThis gap between formality and responsibility causes unnecessary skepticism. Public is advised by the government officials to segregate household waste and be careful with hazardous and biomedical waste but they see offices in government, institutions and hospitals failing to follow their own rules. This sets a very wrong example in their mind. Young children are taught at school about recycling and pollution but growing up they witness the waste being dumped at the roadside or casual attitude of adults about waste. So, we should be responsible of our actions and lessons learned in our formative years should shape how we act as responsible citizens. This will ensure that these actions become a habit and our first thought is about efficient waste disposal and not merely getting rid of waste at hand.\n\nIt is easily said that we should be accountable for our actions but what does it look like in practice?\n\nTransparency: Institutions must be willing to publish data on how much waste they generate, how it is classified, and where it goes. This simple act of disclosure puts pressure on leaders to move beyond rhetoric and allows the public to hold them to account.\n\nTraining: Waste management cannot be outsourced to the lowest rung of the institutional hierarchy. From cleaners to senior administrators, every stakeholder needs clear guidance, defined responsibility, and the resources to carry out safe disposal practices."

From cleaners to senior administrators, every stakeholder needs clear guidance, defined responsibility, and the resources to carry out safe disposal practices.\n\nSuch collaborations have resulted in bringing out positive change. Mc Clelland Engineers worked with hospitals, research centers and industries for efficient waste disposal using thermal systems tailor made to each waste type. Incinerators are not a one size fits all solution; it needs to be engineered. For this knowledge about the waste type and installation site conditions are needed to ensure combustion is controlled condition and released gases remain within the regulatory limits. Thus, the risks to patients, staff, and surrounding communities are significantly lowered.\n\nThese interventions should not be thought as a method to full fill the regulatory requirement or escape fines or punishments. They fill a larger role of protectors that allows institutions to operate without disruption or harming the life or environment. From secure storage for infectious waste to infrastructure that ensures safe segregation and disposal, the emphasis is on making compliance routine rather than optional. When systems are built this way, staff are not forced to improvise safe practice becomes the default.\n\nIntroducing accountability into the concept of waste management systems would ensure that the institutions do not have to choose between efficiency and responsibility and firms like Mc Clelland with demonstrate experience can guide them with the right infrastructure, they can achieve both."

It is not enough for governments to draft rules; institutions must adopt and practice them. Waste management must be treated not as a compliance burden, but as a marker of credibility and integrity.\n\nInstitutional leaders, hospital directors, government secretaries must stop treating waste as a unimprotant matter. Waste management is central to health, safety, and institutional reputation. A school that dumps waste irresponsibly is teaching irresponsibility. A hospital that mishandles biomedical waste is not just careless it is helping spread disease.\n\nLeadership also means facing uncomfortable truths. Sadly, many institutions often cut cost on waste management, treating it as an afterthought and something they assume public will not notice. This is not true as now the communities are now more aware of environmental issues and institutional negligence. Communities have seen firsthand the devastating impact on health and environment. It has now become clear to the institutions that either they play by the rules, or they lose public trust.\n\nIn the end, waste management is about more than disposal it is a test of integrity.

    "chunk_text": "Empowering Rooftop Solar With Smart Battery Storage: An Economic Rescue With Grid Stability\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s rooftop solar program has reached 1,700 MW across nearly 100,000 households and buildings. However, due to economic challenges and reduced tariffs for home solar investors, the program has recently slowed. While there is a strong commitment to promoting solar energy, including the President\u2019s recent launch of a 100 MW solar project, its benefits to the public can only be fully realised if surplus power is stored.\n\nThe Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has warned that grid instability is a risk when integrating large volumes of solar. This makes storage of daytime generation crucial for evening use, ideally through affordable and scalable methods. Unfortunately, the CEB has prioritised large-scale battery tenders, such as a proposed 640 MWh Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), which would be funded at public expense. Yet investor appetite remains weak, as financial returns are limited.\n\nA smarter path forward is a win-win strategy where households adopt distributed batteries in conjunction with rooftop solar. This approach provides sufficient returns to investors, saves public money, and aligns with the President\u2019s declared vision of producing energy at the lowest cost in the region. It would attract investors and entrepreneurs, create jobs, reduce daily living costs, and finally move Sri Lanka towards a greener and more equitable energy future\u2014after decades of public money mismanagement in the power sector.\n\nInstead of centralised storage, Sri Lanka can unlock hidden capacity in existing rooftop systems by encouraging households to install subsidised batteries supported by a guaranteed evening peak tariff.\n\n* 40% daytime use, 60% shiftable: If 40% of rooftop output is consumed directly, the remaining 60% (~1,000 MW) can be stored and dispatched in the evening."

However, only distributed storage avoids public debt, frees up land, rewards citizens, and aligns with the government\u2019s vision for Community Energy Cooperatives outlined in the NPP Manifesto.\n\nThis is not just about the grid. It is about shaping a national energy strategy that delivers affordability, resilience, and prosperity for all Sri Lankans."

It will provide 24-hour monitoring of 37 state institutions involved in the country\u2019s digital infrastructure such as the Departments of Immigration and Emigration, Inland Revenue, and Motor Traffic against potential cyber-attacks.\n\nThis is a move in the right direction since, due to lack of data sharing and coordination among these state institutions, the public is greatly inconvenienced. For instance, to have a new car registered, the member of the public should report his taxpayer identification number or TIN to the motor vehicle registration authorities. This number can easily be learned of by accessing online to the data base of the inland revenue authorities. But this facility has not been provided and the member of the public concerned should produce a hardcopy of the certificate issued by the latter institution."

If digital transformation is not allowed, digitising information in stand-alone institutions is a waste.\n\nSince the digital space is rich with resources, it naturally draws the interested persons to hack the systems to gain an undue enrichment. Hence, hackers and modes of hacking are aplenty.[3] Government institutions are hacked not only for money but also to embarrass the rulers through temporary stoppage of government activities. Hence, Anura Kumara Dissanayake Government which is bent on making a digital transformation of the Sri Lanka economy is correct in its action to setup an outfit that will monitor the work of the key institutions day and night and prevent cyber attackers from destroying the system.\n\nThis is a precautionary activity done by the Government to protect the government institutions from cyberspace crimes. It is a must, but it is necessary to protect other stakeholders too in an economy, namely, private businesses, and private individuals. This is where a supplementary work program is needed to make the system completely free from cyberspace crimes."

Underscoring the force majeure it intends unleashing on unsuspecting abusers of state assets and at the same time silencing dissenting voices among its supporters who may have entertained second thoughts about the JVP-led regime\u2019s bona fides of late.\n\nOne of the key promises made and kept was the amendment of the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax under the \u2018economic reforms\u2019 plank. The Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 2 of 2025, which came in to effect on 1 April (no fooling around there!), revised tax brackets to ease the burden borne by the earning/taxpaying masses and increased the tax-free threshold from Rs. 100,000 to 150,000. For this relief, sighed the conscientious taxpayers, many thanks!\n\nAnd running in tandem with this welcome legislation was the provision of a minimum monthly financial grant ranging from 10,000 rupees to Rs. 17,500 for low-income families, which cabinet decision of December 2024 parliament ratified. The proof of the pol palaa porridge will be how well these Aswesuma funds, which were boosted from LKR 205 billion in 2024 to LKR 232.5 billion the next year, are used per Budget 2025.\n\nAnd in similar vein (sympathetic to the notion of setting up a safety net for islanders susceptible to unsustainable socioeconomic falls) was approval by the Cabinet for providing a monthly allowance of Rs. 5,000 to senior citizens needing assistance; a minimum monthly financial grant on a needs-basis of Rs. 10,000 to persons with chronic illnesses; as well as a similarly timed comparable disbursement (10,000/- monthly) to people with disabilities in low-income families."

They also discussed the challenges faced by women Parliamentarians and highlighted the need for support mechanisms, including counselling.\n\nThe Caucus further engaged in discussions on intergenerational dialogue as a way to encourage young women to enter politics.

Gardiner Mawatha in Colombo yesterday, after Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) workers staged a demonstration opposite the CEB headquarters. The protest, which blocked one lane between the Lake House roundabout and Slave Island, disrupted evening traffic and forced police to advise motorists to take alternate routes.\n\nThe demonstration was part of an escalating trade union campaign against the Government\u2019s plan to restructure the CEB into four entities. Large numbers of workers carrying placards gathered outside the CEB Head Office, shouting slogans and obstructing traffic for several hours.\n\nThe protest follows a series of trade union actions launched earlier this month. Unions began a work-to-rule campaign on 4 September, refusing duties beyond their core responsibilities. As part of the second phase, employees called in sick on 17 September, continuing the action into a second day yesterday.\n\nUnion leaders warned that measures would intensify if the authorities fail to respond to their demands.\n\nThe CEB Engineers\u2019 Union has also opposed the move, arguing that dividing the State utility risks undermining its stability. Trade unions said their actions are aimed at pressuring the Government without directly disrupting electricity supply to consumers."

First, it was a massive mandate given to the new Government by the people. This mandate reflected the nation\u2019s desire for a complete break from past approaches. Successive Governments since 1948 had left a trail of economic mismanagement. Their policies often enriched a few while burdening the majority. Corruption, nepotism, and shortsighted decisions became common. The damage was seen in livelihoods, education, healthcare, and national unity. Ordinary citizens paid the price with rising poverty and lost opportunities. Trust in government eroded with each administration. The people demanded an end to this cycle of betrayal and neglect. The overwhelming mandate was thus a call for real change and renewal."

It shows the people that their leaders will stand with them, not above them. By rejecting special privileges, the Government is also breaking down a long-standing sense of inequality. Ultimately, this approach builds trust, enhances accountability, and fosters unity between rulers and citizens.\n\nThe third reason comes from the example set by the first Government, which made a clear and deliberate statement about public service and accountability. From the start, this Government chose to lead by example, greatly reducing all privileges, perks, and unnecessary entitlements usually given to political leaders and senior officials. Luxury vehicles, personal staff, housing allowances, and other benefits were either cut or eliminated, leaving only the essential resources needed to perform official duties effectively. By doing so, the Government showed that public office is a position of responsibility, not a way to gain personal wealth."

By setting such a powerful example, the first Government laid the foundation for subsequent administrations to follow, making it clear that authentic leadership requires sacrifice, humility, and dedication to the common good. In doing so, it redefined what it means to serve the nation.\n\nFourth, the Government displayed stunningly outstanding discipline across every front, directly countering claims made by Mahinda Rajapaksa that it lacked direction or control. From financial management to policy implementation, from administrative efficiency to public engagement, every aspect of governance reflected meticulous planning and rigorous oversight. Budgets were adhered to with precision, resources were allocated transparently, and deadlines were consistently met, demonstrating a level of organisational discipline rarely seen in previous administrations.

Their motives are often driven by self-interest rather than the national good, showing how the legacy of self-centred politics continues to block development. At the same time, figures like Maithripala Sirisena demonstrate complete self-interest, having completely abandoned Colombo and left behind the privileges of his official residence, highlighting a disregard for accountability or civic duty.\n\nThe contrast between past leadership and the current Government is striking. For decades, the people of Sri Lanka endured governance driven by self-interest, privilege, and loyalty to a few, with power concentrated in the hands of a select few. Meanwhile, the majority struggled to meet their basic needs. Leaders like Mahinda Rajapaksa created dependency networks, protected corruption, and prioritised personal luxury over public good. The sour fish stew in the village symbolises that such leadership is temporary, fragile, and disconnected from the realities of the people. The privileges that once secured loyalty now seem irrelevant as the populace has awakened and the Government is now committed to principles."

Meanwhile, the majority struggled to meet their basic needs. Leaders like Mahinda Rajapaksa created dependency networks, protected corruption, and prioritised personal luxury over public good. The sour fish stew in the village symbolises that such leadership is temporary, fragile, and disconnected from the realities of the people. The privileges that once secured loyalty now seem irrelevant as the populace has awakened and the Government is now committed to principles.\n\nIt is this rare combination of vision, courage, and ethical clarity that ensures AKD\u2019s legacy will endure. While past leaders will fade into the footnotes of history, AKD will be remembered by generations as the leader who put the people first, who acted with conscience, and who demonstrated that true power lies not in privilege but in service. The new era has begun, and it is one where the nation and its citizens will thrive under leadership that is just, disciplined, and profoundly human."

This is a response to the arrogance of the Minister and the Director General in particular. But if the President continues to respond in the same way, we will be compelled to escalate matters further,\u201d Abeysinghe said.\n\nThe union campaign started on 4 September with a work-to-rule action, followed by a sick-leave protest on 17 and 18 September.\n\nEarlier this week, Energy Minister Eng. Kumara Jayakody said that the Government\u2019s restructuring of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) will not undermine employee job security or labour rights, despite trade union concerns and ongoing protest threats.\n\nAddressing the media, the Minister explaining the reforms noted that the CEB currently consists of four key institutions, Generation, Transmission, Distribution, and Systems Administration, staffed by around 23,000 employees and fully State-owned under the licencing and regulatory oversight of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL).\n\nIn addition, the CEB operates a retirement fund, the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund (EPF) and a separate funding company, where staff from the four core institutions are now being considered for redeployment."

However, he said the Government has opted to offer a more favourable package in line with employee preferences. \u201cAfter considering the new reforms, the Government has decided to extend the compensation with Rs. 5 million for all employees keen on the VRS, as all employees are equally important to us,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough a past Cabinet decision to cut 12,000 jobs at the CEB remains on record, Jayakody clarified that this has not been included in the present reform package. Instead, the restructuring is aimed at reducing inefficiencies, cutting dependence on expensive liquid-fuel power generation, and positioning the CEB to attract international financing, particularly from the Asian Development Bank (ADB)."

He stressed Minister Peiris had not given a written document to US Secretary Clinton. It\u2019s only a verbal explanation, he stressed.

    "chunk_text": "Tribute to Rajiv Perera on 60th birthday\n\nIn life we meet many people, most of whom hardly leave a trace of their passing. Some, very few in fact, leave a mark so deep that no passage of time can erase it. For me, at the very top of that list is Rajiv Perera.\n\nI knew of Rajiv at school \u2013 St. Thomas\u2019, Mount Lavinia \u2013 where he was a few years senior to me. A fine sportsman, he played rugby for S. Thomas\u2019, CH & FC, and Sri Lanka. On the field he was fearless yet always a gentleman, respected by teammates and opponents alike. That same spirit carried into the rest of his life, competitive when it mattered, but always fair, always gracious.\n\nBut I only really got to know him when I went to the UK for my higher studies, about 35 years ago. This was around the time that John Major had replaced the Iron Lady, Margaret Thatcher, and was just settling in as Prime Minister. I knew only a few people in London. It was through the Thomian network that I met Rajiv. We clicked immediately.\n\nThe UK Old Boys\u2019 Association always looked after students who had just arrived in Britain. But Rajiv went far beyond that. He quickly became my closest friend and my greatest asset in London. I must confess that I sometimes took his friendship for granted. He never complained, never made me feel a burden. He simply gave with a loyalty that cannot be expressed in words.\n\nI was living in the university halls of residence, yet Rajja would drive more than one and a half hours just to take me for a haircut. If I craved a Sri Lankan meal, he would pick me up, take me home and cook a spread that no one could match. He could cook almost anything, always tasty, always fast, and always better than anyone else. I would never have survived my university years without him."

The old Thomian team used to practice at Northwick Park, with Rohan Karunaratne, another who is sadly no longer with us, as a coach. Rajiv played a key role in all this, not just as a former player himself, but as the man who bound everyone together. Some days, after rugger practice, the natural next stop was Rajja\u2019s place, where food, laughter, and insults were, in abundance.\n\nThose nights at Rajiv\u2019s house were unforgettable. It was the stage for endless banter. Nobody was spared, and the teasing flew as freely as the food and drinks. We laughed until our stomachs hurt, and if you went home without being embarrassed, you knew you hadn\u2019t really been part of the evening. Rajiv himself rarely drank, and then only for company, but he was always at the centre of it, cooking, serving, laughing, and making sure everyone left happier than when they arrived.\n\nRajiv became, for thousands of Sri Lankans, the first port of call in London. He did the pick-ups and drop-offs from Heathrow, drove people around, fed them, and often even sent them away with gifts. Many of us, when a friend travelled to London, would simply call Rajiv knowing he would step in, without hesitation, to provide a meal, a lift, or simply good company."

Even when people took advantage of him, he never reacted in anger. He is an extremely civilised man who would never utter hurtful words to anyone. Whenever he did a favour, he did it quietly, without making a song and dance about it. His only concern was to make people happy, never to make them sad.\n\nRajiv\u2019s biggest weakness, if one can call it that, is his inability to say no \u2013 even to those who offered little or nothing in return. He helped those who deserved it, and even those who did not. It is a reflection of his kindness and generosity of spirit.\n\nAnd yet, despite all that, Rajiv is an accomplished Thomian; a man full of grit and determination, and a human being overflowing with kindness and affection for everyone. He has a wonderfully dry sense of humour, delivered with a straight face, and a heart that is as big as any I have known.\n\nGod above has been kind to me in giving me extraordinary friends. Once, a Lebanese friend I came to admire within a very short time told me, \u201cKrishantha, my address book is the wealth I will leave my children.\u201d I understood what he meant.

    "chunk_text": "JVP-led NPP Govt. must take meaningful action to end illegal Indian fishing in northern waters\n\nThe Tamil Nadu fishers have displayed unbelievable hostility and animus towards their Tamil speaking counterparts in Sri Lanka\n\nThe ongoing problem of illegal fishing and bottom trawling in Sri Lanka\u2019s northern territorial waters by Indian fishers from Tamil Nadu state was described in detail in the first part of this article published last week. Particular attention was devoted to the bogey of Katchatheevu being raised by the Indian side to sidetrack the issue. As emphasised previously the fundamental problem is illegal fishing in Sri Lankan waters and not the question of Katchatheevu islet ownership. Certain salient points regarding the illegal fishing by Tamil Nadu fishers will be related in this second and final part of this article.\n\nAn extremely troubling factor in this issue is the attitude and conduct of Tamil Nadu fishers towards their northern Sri Lankan counterparts. The Tamil Nadu fishers have displayed unbelievable hostility and animus towards their Tamil speaking counterparts in Sri Lanka. If Sri Lankan Tamil fishermen get caught to the invading marauders, they are severely assaulted and their boats and equipment damaged or destroyed. Fishing nets owned by Sri Lankan fishermen have been deliberately damaged or destroyed by Indian fishers.\n\nIn one instance some Indian boats ventured very close to the Maadagal-Chuzhipuram coast and destroyed fishing nets. In a rare occurrence, compensation was paid by the Indian diplomatic mission in Sri Lanka.\n\nThus it could be seen that Tamil Nadu fishermen are ruthlessly and rapaciously exploiting the marine resources of northern Sri Lanka and causing irredeemable harm in the process. There is no concern about preserving marine resources for sustainable fishing. There is also no sympathy or empathy for their war-ravaged Sri Lankan Tamil \u201cbrethren\u201d struggling to eke out a living and re-build their shattered lives."

There is no concern about preserving marine resources for sustainable fishing. There is also no sympathy or empathy for their war-ravaged Sri Lankan Tamil \u201cbrethren\u201d struggling to eke out a living and re-build their shattered lives.\n\nInstead it has become a capitalist industry. Fish and shrimps and crabs have become \u201ccommodified\u201d. They are commodities to be produced and sold as much as possible without any concern for livelihood longevity. The large fishing boats and trawlers are owned by rich capitalists. Several of them are either politicians or possess political links. Many of the boats are owned by fishermen who are \u201cbenamis\u201d of others.\n\nBenami refers to people who are supposedly the legal owners of assets that actually belong to someone else. Since there is a land ceiling in Tamil Nadu and most states in India, many landowners have registered their excess lands in the names of their illiterate employees and servants as \u201cbenamis\u201d.\n\nLikewise many fishing boats are registered in the names of fishermen who are actually benamis. This was discovered by Dutch researchers studying the Indo-Lanka fishing disputes.\n\nThese researchers also found that most of the fishing boat crews in Tamil Nadu were from castes that did not engage traditionally in fishing. They were hired on a daily wage basis and are forced into illegal fishing in Sri Lankan waters by their employers. Most of the fish are exported.\n\nAnother point in this regard is how such a huge number of fishing boats are able to venture out into Sri Lankan waters without being restrained or apprehended by Indian authorities. It is obvious that Indian authorities are deliberately turning a blind eye towards what is happening, or are being instructed by their political masters to do so. The possibility of being bribed too, cannot be ruled out."

The possibility of being bribed too, cannot be ruled out.\n\nThe issue of Indian fisherfolk from Tamil Nadu, fishing illegally in Sri Lanka\u2019s northern waters in large numbers, and destroying marine life through pernicious practices such as bottom trawling was discussed by President Disanayake and Narendra Modi when the Indian PM visited Sri Lanka in April this year. One is not aware of how exactly this issue was discussed by the two leaders, but their media statements illustrated the \u201cdivergence\u201d of perspectives on the question.\n\nPresident Disanayake emphasised that a \u201ccooperative approach for a sustainable solution\u201d to the problem was necessary. He further said: \u201crecognising the serious environmental damage caused by bottom trawling\u2026\u2026we call for decisive measures to halt this activity and to address illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.\u201d\n\nThe Indian Prime minister, on the other hand, was more sanguine. Describing it as a matter of livelihood, Narendra Modi said that the Sri Lankan president and he had agreed on a \u201chumane approach\u201d being adopted towards the issue. The Indian PM underscored the need for the immediate release of Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan custody and their seized boats.\n\nSubsequently, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told the media in Colombo that the two countries had agreed to intensify institutional discussions and facilitate talks between fishermen associations from both sides in the near future. \u201cIt is something that has remained a constant feature of discussions at all levels including high levels between the two sides,\u201d said the Foreign Secretary."

The Tamil Nadu fishermen must stop their illegal fishing in Sri Lankan territorial waters. They must stop the detestable practice of bottom trawling. Sri Lanka\u2019s long suffering Tamil fishermen who were battered and bruised during the long years of the war should be allowed to rebuild their lives and resurrect their livelihood. The Tamil Nadu fishers must refrain from invading Sri Lanka\u2019s fishing waters.\n\nSadly, the dominant Indian attitude and approach towards the issue is different. From Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Muttuvel Karunanidhi Stalin, the response is that this problem should be treated humanely and resolved through talks.\n\nThe humane approach advocated is not based on concern for the victimised Sri Lankan Tamil fishermen. It is for the invading Tamil Nadu fishermen poaching in Sri Lankan seas. They are depicted wrongly as the victims. The Sri Lankan navy is falsely accused of being the aggressors. \u2018The Lankan navy is cruelly arresting the innocent Tamil Nadu fishermen and seizing their boats\u2019 is the Indian narrative. It is sustained and strengthened by the Indian mainstream media and social media.\n\nThe kinder and gentler humanitarian approach they want is to not arrest the Indian fishermen or seize their boats. In short, they want the Indian fishermen to continue plundering our marine resources and deprive our fishermen in the name of a humane approach. Sympathy is for the predator and not the prey."

Sympathy is for the predator and not the prey.\n\nThe poaching and bottom trawling, however, continues with no sign of abatement. Resolving the Indian illegal fishing issue through negotiations is a farce that has been enacted for several decades. Meanwhile frustration rises among northern Tamil fisherfolk.\n\nIt is this sense of frustration that led to large numbers of people from coastal areas in the north to vote for the JVP-led NPP in the recent presidential, parliamentary and local authority elections. Anura Kumara Disanayake addressing election meetings pledged to remedy the situation and end the Illegal Indian fishing and bottom trawling. Many Tamils voted for the Compass only because they believed Anura and trusted him.\n\nThe JVP-led NPP won three of the six seats in Jaffna. The JVP point man in Jaffna Ramalingam Chandrasekar was appointed Fisheries Minister. Chandrasekar talked tough about Indian fishers and thundered \u201cNaangal Chandiyarhal Vanthu vittoam\u201d (we who are thugs or Chandiyas have arrived). What Chandrasekar implied was that a tough line would be taken against Indian illegal fishing.\n\nMinister of Fisheries and Aquatic and Ocean Resources Ramalingam Chandrasekar, hailing from Bandarawela is the JVP-NPP organiser for Jaffna. Chandrasekar who has resided in Jaffna for several years is very familiar with the problems faced by northern fishermen at the hands of their Tamil speaking brethren from Tamil Nadu. As mentioned earlier, a huge segment of the coastal population in Jaffna voted for the Compass at the 2024 Parliamentary election because of the promise that poaching by Tamil Nadu fishers would be stopped."

Katchatheevu is not the problem. The problem is the Indian fishers passing beyond the waters off Katchatheevu and invading northern territorial waters.\n\nThe Sri Lankan Government must not let itself be deluded by the illusion of Katchatheevu ownership and be diverted from the main problem. The Indian fishing lobby would very much like to keep the Katchatheevu ownership boiling while the illegal fishing and bottom trawling continues merrily.\n\nThe problem is illegal fishing in our waters by Indian fishers. That problem cannot be resolved by President Disanayake and Fisheries Minister Chandrasekhar sailing to Katchatheevu in a naval vessel. It can only be reduced by the navy taking consistent action against the Indian fishing boats fishing illegally in our waters."

Global protests in all forms even from within Israel against US supported Israeli genocide of Palestinians and pulverisation of Gaza city with an ultimate agenda to annex Gaza and West Bank to create Eretz Israel is sufficient support for such a resolution.\n\nAlmost a year ago when a Palestinian mother became so exasperated and angry after losing one of her children to an Israeli bomb, she raised her hands and shouted, \u201cShame on you Arabs. Wake up!\u201d Now it is not her alone, but the entire humanity is shouting. Will the Arabs and their fellow Muslims wake up? You have been in slumber for nearly a millennium. It is your slumber that is causing nonstate actors like Hamas and Ansarullah to take up the cause of Palestine.\n\nOf what use are wordy and vociferous summits without action?"

    "chunk_text": "Sri Lanka\u2019s hollow democracy: Need to awaken and reclaim our nation\n\nParliamentarians no longer represent the people but act as protectors of privilege, brokers of fraud, and breakers of law\n\nI often wonder whether our nation\u2019s founders ever paused to reflect before adopting the foundational principles of Democratic, Socialist, and Republic to define the country. A nation\u2019s self-identification shapes not only its domestic policies but also its relationship with its people and its place in the world. Misinterpreting or inconsistently applying these terms risks deep conflict, ideological, institutional, and social, which we have adequately experienced. Before judging the merits of this identity, we must return to the fundamentals of democracy: does it serve some of the people some of the time, or all of the people all of the time?\n\nThe core principles of democracy: liberty, equality, and justice are meant for all, not merely for a majority or a privileged few as under colonial rule. These values, grounded in reason and rationality, are designed to elevate human dignity and secure social justice for everyone. In today\u2019s interconnected world, where global challenges demand collective solutions, safeguarding these principles through ethical governance and strong institutions is indispensable.\n\nWhen elements of democracy, such as universal franchise in 1931, were introduced to colonial Ceylon, they were carefully engineered to preserve colonial power. Authority remained concentrated at the top, while ordinary citizens were denied meaningful influence. Voting was manipulated by elites, with the majority bound to landowners who colluded with political leaders. After independence in 1948, this framework did not change; the local ruling class simply inherited and perpetuated the system. Rather than laying a new foundation for a genuine democracy, colonial totalitarianism mutated into autocratic rule but with a Democratic, Socialist tagline."

Governments must be held accountable to serve the people, uphold the law, and protect individual liberties. Citizens should have the authority to elect and, if necessary, impeach their representatives through judicial processes, to exercise genuine self-governance within truly devolved systems. A free and independent media must be protected from intimidation, manipulation, or to advocate corporate agendas. Above all, TRUE Democracy must be reclaimed, not as a hollow slogan, but as a government of the people, by the people, and for the people to ensure equal freedoms and dignity for all."

    "chunk_text": "Similarities and differences of three recent uprisings in South Asia: Lesson for democracies\n\nTaken together, these uprisings demonstrate both the resilience and the fragility of democracy in South Asia. They remind us that popular sovereignty is not exercised only at the ballot box but also in the streets when institutions falter. Repression corrodes legitimacy, while timely engagement can transform dissent into democratic renewal. For democracies everywhere, the lesson is clear: listen to citizens before the street becomes the only forum for dialogue\n\nSouth Asia is living through an era of popular uprisings that has reshaped the political vocabulary of the region. In Colombo, Dhaka and Kathmandu, ordinary citizens\u2014many of them strikingly young\u2014have turned public squares into stages for democratic confrontation. These movements differ in their national contexts and immediate triggers, yet together they illuminate how people power can both rescue and test democratic institutions.\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s Aragalaya of 2022 remains the most dramatic of the three. Confronted with an unprecedented economic collapse, spiralling inflation and crippling shortages of fuel and medicine, citizens of every ethnicity converged on Colombo\u2019s Galle Face Green. Their demand was simple but revolutionary: an end to executive overreach and the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Despite occasional provocations and isolated violence, the protests were largely peaceful, disciplined and inclusive."

In Bangladesh, inflation and job insecurity gave otherwise abstract calls for electoral reform a visceral urgency. In Nepal, stagnant growth and chronic corruption fed a slower but equally potent sense of grievance. Across the region, material hardship turned constitutional debate into a matter of daily survival.\n\nPerhaps the most striking similarity is the instinct for non-violence. Candle-light vigils, communal kitchens and volunteer-run medical posts became the public face of protest from Colombo to Kathmandu.

Yet Nepal\u2019s storming of parliament is a reminder that when governments delay or dismiss dialogue, even largely peaceful movements can tip into confrontation.\n\nWhere the uprisings diverge most sharply is in their outcomes. Sri Lanka stands out as the clearest example of peaceful protest leading to systemic change. After the Aragalaya, the country moved from sovereign default to a surprisingly swift recovery. Inflation, which had exceeded 70%, fell to single digits. Foreign reserves climbed beyond $ 6 billion, and gross domestic product grew by about 5% in 2024 after two years of contraction. Parliament passed the 21st Amendment to the Constitution, restoring key checks on presidential power and limiting the head of state\u2019s ability to dissolve Parliament or dismiss the prime minister.\n\nIn the 2024 General election the left-leaning National People\u2019s Power coalition captured a historic super-majority, seating more than one hundred and fifty first-time members of parliament and a record number of women. It appears that the current Government is committed to anti-corruption drives, welfare expansion and land redistribution, even as they adhere to the fiscal discipline demanded by the International Monetary Fund. This combination of constitutional reform, generational turnover and early economic rebound illustrates how a largely peaceful uprising can catalyse deep structural change."

    "chunk_text": "In the 2024 General election the left-leaning National People\u2019s Power coalition captured a historic super-majority, seating more than one hundred and fifty first-time members of parliament and a record number of women. It appears that the current Government is committed to anti-corruption drives, welfare expansion and land redistribution, even as they adhere to the fiscal discipline demanded by the International Monetary Fund. This combination of constitutional reform, generational turnover and early economic rebound illustrates how a largely peaceful uprising can catalyse deep structural change.\n\nThe youth factor runs like a bright thread through these stories. Young organisers in each country mastered the tools of the digital age to mobilise support and to counter disinformation. They also expressed a clear impatience with politics as usual, demanding not only regime change but job creation, climate action and transparent governance. Their involvement presents both an opportunity and a challenge. Governments that harness this energy through inclusive dialogue can convert dissent into constructive nation-building. Those that dismiss it risk alienating the very generation on whom their countries\u2019 future depends.\n\nTaken together, these uprisings demonstrate both the resilience and the fragility of democracy in South Asia. They remind us that popular sovereignty is not exercised only at the ballot box but also in the streets when institutions falter. Repression corrodes legitimacy, while timely engagement can transform dissent into democratic renewal. For democracies everywhere, the lesson is clear: listen to citizens before the street becomes the only forum for dialogue."

Themed \u201cSri Lanka at the crossroads: Navigating trade turbulence, currency risk & the global reset\u201d, organised exclusively for the bank\u2019s trade, treasury, and corporate customers. The event reinforced Sampath Bank\u2019s commitment to providing foresight and strategic guidance amidst global economic shifts, bringing together policymakers, economists, and corporate leaders to debate the country\u2019s position in an increasingly uncertain global order.\n\nOpening the discussion, Sampath Bank Chairman Harsha Amarasekera set the tone by warning that geopolitical realignments, volatile capital flows, and recalibrating financial markets are reshaping the very foundation of Sri Lanka\u2019s growth model. \u201cTrade turbulence, currency risk and the global reset are no longer abstract concepts,\u201d he noted. \u201cEach of these forces touches every business, every investor and every household in our country.\u201d\n\nAmarasekera urged stakeholders to look beyond defensive strategies, stressing that resilience in trade is now an imperative rather than an option. Traditional export markets are no longer guaranteed, he argued, and Sri Lanka must diversify, innovate, and move exports higher up the value chain. He also highlighted the necessity of managing currency exposure through hedging and deeper financial market reforms to anchor long-term stability."

Traditional export markets are no longer guaranteed, he argued, and Sri Lanka must diversify, innovate, and move exports higher up the value chain. He also highlighted the necessity of managing currency exposure through hedging and deeper financial market reforms to anchor long-term stability.\n\nDelivering the keynote address, Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe described Sri Lanka\u2019s economic recovery since the 2022 crisis as remarkable, highlighting both progress made and the challenges that remain. He noted that the country broke a six-quarter streak of economic contraction in late 2023 and has sustained positive growth since then, with GDP expected to expand by around 4.5% in 2025, exceeding projections by several international agencies.\n\nInflation, which reached record highs at the peak of the crisis, was brought down to single digits within a year through tight monetary policy, an achievement Dr. Weerasinghe described as unprecedented in comparable global cases. Inflation is now anchored around the Central Bank\u2019s 5% target, allowing monetary policy to adopt a more accommodative stance that supports growth while maintaining stability.\n\nOn external balances, Dr. Weerasinghe highlighted a historic turnaround: the current account returned to surplus in 2023 for the first time in decades, and the country is on track to record three consecutive years of surpluses by end-2025. Foreign reserves have been rebuilt to levels exceeding 2016, supported by remittances, tourism, and export gains, with reserve accumulation now largely organic rather than debt driven. The Sri Lankan Rupee, though modestly weaker this year, is trading under a flexible exchange rate regime that reflects market fundamentals."

While recent US tariffs on apparel have been negotiated down to 20%, he stressed the urgency of diversifying both products and markets to reduce vulnerability. Emerging sectors such as ICT, maritime logistics, and high-end services, alongside deeper integration into regional trade frameworks, were identified as critical pathways for resilience.\n\nHe also highlighted the importance of sustaining reforms in debt management, state-owned enterprise restructuring, and fiscal discipline to prevent a relapse into crisis. \u201cStability is not an end in itself,\u201d he said, \u201cbut a foundation upon which we must build a more competitive, investment-driven economy.\u201d\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s economy faces a critical juncture, driven by structural reforms, private sector momentum, and a rapidly shifting global landscape.

Without a broad understanding of economic fundamentals, he argued, the public could be swayed by populist narratives, risking a reversal of hard-won gains."

Private credit is expanding by nearly 18% year-on-year, making the current cycle more sustainable than past episodes, provided reforms are protected.\n\nThe panel then turned to the global context, exploring how changing international trade dynamics intersect with Sri Lanka\u2019s economic trajectory."

He emphasised that the country\u2019s export growth has largely plateaued within existing products, highlighting the need for diversification into new sectors and industrial zones, leveraging FDI and diaspora knowledge to foster innovation and expand product offerings. Jafferjee stressed that US consumption dominates global demand, and navigating American economic diplomacy is essential for exporters seeking growth.\n\nTurning to the domestic foreign exchange environment, the discussion noted that current account surpluses are creating a fundamentally different FX market than in past deficit-driven cycles.

This represents a significant shift in how Sri Lankan businesses can plan and participate in global trade while managing currency risk.\n\nThe panel concluded by addressing the implications of portfolio inflows, public debt, and long-term growth prospects for Sri Lanka.\n\nModerator Chayu Damsinghe opened the discussion by asking about potential portfolio inflows following recent credit improvements and investor roadshows. Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy highlighted past lessons, noting that when portfolio limits were raised to 12.5% of rupee securities, the inflows became destabilising, complicating exchange rate management and undermining monetary policy autonomy.

He emphasised the need for institutional mechanisms such as the Productivity Commission, investment zones, and investment promotion agencies, alongside stronger competition in state-owned enterprises.\n\nDr. Coomaraswamy added that central bank independence remains crucial to withstand political pressures, manage future debt repayments, and maintain monetary policy flexibility. He stressed that past failures in structural reform were due to short electoral cycles, entrenched vested interests, and resistance from powerful individuals, but expressed hope that the current government\u2019s lack of historical baggage may enable meaningful reform."

Sri Lanka now stands at a pivotal moment, supported by a robust macroeconomic framework that calls for vigilance and active engagement. The focus, he emphasised, must be on action rather than hesitation, with policy makers, businesses, and financial institutions working together to turn challenges into opportunities and ensure that the country\u2019s recovery leads to sustainable growth and shared prosperity. He reaffirmed the bank\u2019s commitment to partnering with all stakeholders on this journey, underlining that collective effort and adherence to reforms can secure a more resilient economic future for Sri Lanka."

    "chunk_text": "China\u2019s entry into SAARC: Gateway to South Asian prosperity\n\nA SAARC revitalised by Chinese membership would cease to be a peripheral talking shop and become a formidable actor on the world stage\n\n\u201cChina as a full member of SAARC? At first, the idea may sound bold, even strange. But it could be the spark the region needs to move forward. For years, SAARC has carried a huge promise; a platform to connect markets, people, and ideas across South Asia. Yet political tensions have often slowed its progress. Bringing China into the fold could give SAARC fresh energy, new opportunities, and a stronger voice in the world.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s entry could change that. With its huge economy, global influence, and experience in building connections, China can inject new life into SAARC. It could open bigger trade opportunities, boost regional projects, and make SAARC more visible on the world stage.\n\nThe economic argument for China\u2019s full membership in SAARC is not merely compelling; it is an undeniable reflection of the present-day reality. China is no longer a peripheral trading partner; it has fundamentally rewired the economic circuitry of South Asia, becoming the single largest or one of the top two trading partners for every single nation in the bloc. SAARC represents a market of over 1.9 billion people, but intra-regional trade languishes at a dismal 5% of its total trade, compared to 35% in ASEAN. China, as the world\u2019s second-largest economy and the largest trading partner of most SAARC nations, can fundamentally alter this equation.\n\nDespite geopolitical tensions, China remains one of India\u2019s largest goods trading partners, with bilateral trade hitting a staggering $ 130 billion in 2024. This figure dwarfs India\u2019s trade with any SAARC nation. China is Pakistan\u2019s largest trading partner and its largest source of imports. The China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement has solidified this relationship, which is the cornerstone of the $ 65 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)."

The China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement has solidified this relationship, which is the cornerstone of the $ 65 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).\n\nChina is one of Sri Lanka\u2019s largest trading partners and, critically, its largest source of foreign direct investment and infrastructure financing over the past decade, funding iconic projects like the Hambantota Port and Colombo Port City. The Maldives\u2019 \u201cChina In\u201d policy shift underscores its economic reorientation. China is its largest source of imports and a key partner for tourism infrastructure and development projects.\n\nThe aggregate value of China\u2019s trade with SAARC nations is well over $ 200 billion, utterly dwarfing the intra-SAARC trade volume, which struggles to reach $ 23 billion. This disparity is not just a number; it is a symptom of SAARC\u2019s failure to create a viable internal market and a testament to the irresistible pull of the Chinese economy.\n\nChina\u2019s economic influence in South Asia extends far beyond trade, where it is the top partner for every SAARC nation with flows surpassing $180 billion. It is also the region\u2019s foremost investor and builder, directing billions in foreign direct investment especially in energy, telecoms, and manufacturing and financing major infrastructure via the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the AIIB, and Silk Road Fund. These funds develop critical assets: hydropower in Nepal and Pakistan, ports like Gwadar and Hambantota, and digital networks across the region."

The current India-Pakistan deadlock has rendered the SAARC summit process inert since 2014. While no single nation can resolve this bilateral complex issue, China\u2019s unique position enjoying a strategic partnership with Pakistan and a simultaneously complex but major economic relationship with India allows it to play a facilitative role. Within the SAARC framework, China could act as a neutral arbiter of dialogue, encouraging a shift from bilateral disputes to multilateral cooperation on shared challenges like climate change, terrorism, and water security."

The complex web of supply chains, investments, and infrastructure that would bind SAARC and China would create overwhelming incentives for peaceful dispute resolution and diplomatic engagement.\n\nChina has been an Observer state in SAARC since 2007, and its officials have consistently expressed interest in deeper engagement. Observer status, however, is a half-measure that allows for dialogue but excludes contribution to decision-making. The logical and necessary progression is to full membership, where China can assume the responsibilities and obligations that come with shaping the region\u2019s future.\n\nThe objections to this proposal are known, primarily rooted in strategic concerns from New Delhi. But exclusion has not solved these concerns; it has only contributed to regional stagnation. Engagement within a transparent, rules-based multilateral framework is the most proven method to manage differences, build trust, and create mutual gains.\n\nRecent engagement between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping at the SCO summit in Tianjin has underscored the enduring value of dialogue and multilateralism. After years of strategic mistrust, both leaders emphasised that India and China are development partners, not rivals, signalling a willingness to reframe their relationship around stability and mutual growth.\n\nPractical steps such as the resumption of direct flights, eased travel and pilgrimage arrangements, and renewed trade discussions illustrate how transparent, rules-based cooperation delivers tangible benefits to both societies. These developments highlight a broader lesson: exclusion only perpetuates stagnation, while structured engagement within inclusive multilateral frameworks creates pathways to manage differences, build trust, and unlock shared regional prosperity."

Its origins date to 49 BCE, when Julius Caesar, confronted with a political deadlock, led his army across the Rubicon River an act that defied the Roman Senate and marked the beginning of a civil war that forever changed Rome\u2019s destiny. As Caesar reportedly declared, \u201cThe die is cast.\u201d In that single moment, he understood that there was no possibility of retreat, only the certainty of consequences. The step across the river was not just military defiance; it was the point of no return, carrying outcomes that would reshape both his own fate and the future of the Republic.\n\nThis enduring metaphor is equally relevant today, particularly in public finance. Tax reforms, once enacted, rarely allow for reversal without significant disruption. They shape compliance culture, influence trust in institutions, and set into motion economic outcomes that last for years. Policymakers, therefore, must approach decisions with foresight, recognising that some choices commit a nation irreversibly to a fiscal course."

Policymakers, therefore, must approach decisions with foresight, recognising that some choices commit a nation irreversibly to a fiscal course.\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s fiscal history highlights several instances where policy choices assumed an irreversible character. Once enacted, these decisions set in motion long-term economic and institutional consequences that continue to influence the country\u2019s fiscal landscape.\n\nSharp tax hikes in times of crisis may be unavoidable, but they leave little room for households and businesses to adjust and once the state grows reliant on the revenue, rolling back becomes fiscally risky.\n\nFor years, exporters in Sri Lanka have voiced frustration over long delays in receiving VAT refunds, a problem that strained cash flow and eroded business confidence. The Suspended VAT (SVAT) scheme was initially introduced to tackle these delays, but it brought its own set of complexities. With the scheme set to be abolished in 2025, the country has moved to a more streamlined VAT refund system, designed to process claims faster and within a clear timeframe. The success of this reform will be closely watched: if refunds continue to lag, distrust among businesses may linger; but if the system delivers as promised, it could mark a pivotal moment, strengthening compliance and restoring faith in the tax system. Much like crossing the Rubicon, the outcome of this reform could have long-lasting implications for the credibility of Sri Lanka\u2019s tax administration."

    "chunk_text": "Streamlined procedures, intuitive digital interfaces, and consistent guidance are essential for building a tax system that is predictable, user-friendly, and responsive. Such a system not only reduces the compliance burden but also fosters trust and encourages taxpayers to engage constructively with the revenue authorities.\n\nHistory and current experience underline the need for careful foresight in fiscal policymaking. Before making major tax changes, policymakers should consider key principles:\n\nAffordability: Taxes should reflect what citizens and businesses can reasonably pay.\n\nFairness: Sharing the tax burden equitably encourages voluntary compliance and builds trust.\n\nClarity and simplicity: Simple, easy-to-understand rules reduce compliance costs and disputes.\n\nPredictability: Stable policies allow households and businesses to plan for the long term.\n\nStakeholder engagement: Consulting professional bodies, businesses, and civil society improves the practicality and acceptance of reforms.\n\nPhased implementation: Gradual changes give taxpayers time to adjust, easing the transition.\n\nBy following these principles, fiscal reforms are more likely to succeed and strengthen confidence in the tax system.\n\nEven when major reforms are unavoidable, careful planning and the use of modern tools can help minimise risks and ensure smoother implementation.\n\nTransparent communication: Clearly explain why reforms are needed and how revenue will be used, helping build public understanding and support.\n\nDigital integration: Leverage modern tools such as pre-filled returns, online platforms, and real-time data capturing to make compliance easier and strengthen taxpayer confidence.\n\nMonitoring and review: Use real-time information and analytics to track implementation, identify emerging challenges, and make timely adjustments.\n\nInstitutional capacity building: Strengthen Inland Revenue systems and staff capabilities to ensure effective, data-driven, and sustainable implementation."

These ideas will be distilled into a policy paper, forming part of a series of six policy briefs that will ultimately be presented to policymakers at a roundtable and conference in 2026.\n\nSpeaking at the event, SAPRI Executive Director Madara Ranmuthugala emphasised the institute\u2019s mission to open up meaningful spaces for public participation in national decision-making: \u201cThese monthly events will bring together thought leaders, youth activists, entrepreneurs, and researchers to generate actionable insights for policy reform. We want to ensure that the general population, especially the youth, are aware of the avenues open to them and that all concerned citizens have ample opportunity to get involved in the political and economic policymaking spaces of the country.\u201d"

We learnt a lot in the session and are planning on implementing in our future lives.\u201d\n\nThe series will run from September to February, with a concluding event in March, covering diverse national policy themes. Each session is designed to empower participants to transform discussion into action, producing outputs that can directly shape Sri Lanka\u2019s future.\n\nBeyond this initiative, SAPRI continues to drive innovative projects in reconciliation and youth empowerment, including a pilot Science Education program in Mullaitivu, with plans for expansion across the country."

While a healthy profit is essential for sustainability and growth, an overemphasis on this motive has had a corrosive effect, particularly on the concept of professionalism. Professionalism, at its core, is a set of values and behaviours that transcend the mere commerciality of a transaction. It is founded on principles of expertise, ethical conduct, fiduciary trust, client-centricity, and dedication to public service. When the profit motive becomes the primary driving force, it systematically erodes these foundational pillars, leading to a decline in ethical standards, compromised service quality, and a loss of public trust. Sadly, the nobility of professions has been traded, and is being traded, for silver and gold!"

God does act in mysterious ways!\n\nA professional\u2019s true allegiance is to a set of ethical standards, to a body of knowledge, and to the well-being of the wider community. Two examples will help to illuminate. Some architects, and engineers, refuse to compromise on structural integrity, even when pressured to lower costs. Their loyalty is not just to the construction company; it is to the principles of safe and sustainable design, and to the people who will one day live or work in that building. Some journalists are committed to publishing the truth, despite pressure from higher-ups. Their loyalty is to the public\u2019s right to know, to the integrity of their craft, and to the principles of transparency and accountability.\n\nThis is not an argument against being a good employee. Of course, professionalism involves diligence, hard work, and contributing positively to your organisation. But this allegiance is a means to an end, not the end itself. The end is the public good, and the means is the diligent application of one\u2019s professional skills. The profession provides the framework, the ethical compass, and the standards of excellence that guide a professional\u2019s actions. When an organisation\u2019s interests diverge from these standards, a professional\u2019s duty must always be to the higher calling."

    "chunk_text": "Crafting legacy through collaboration and synergy\n\nThe traditional corporate mindset in Sri Lanka often equates success with control. But in an era where volatility is the only certainty, holding majority stakes does not guarantee sustainability.\n\nThe recent decision by business magnate Dhammika Perera to acquire 50% of LAUGFS Holdings Ltd. (LHL) has taken the Sri Lankan corporate world by surprise. For decades, Perera has built his reputation on outright acquisitions and consolidating controlling stakes\u2014an approach that has made him one of the most powerful figures in Sri Lankan business.\n\nThis time, however, the story is different. Instead of claiming majority control, he entered into an unprecedented 50:50 partnership. The move sent ripples across boardrooms, with many calling me in disbelief, some expressing concern, and others cautiously optimistic. Many friends and peers advised me against agreeing to an equal partnership, warning me about the risks of sharing power with someone of Dhammika\u2019s stature and history.\n\nYet my conviction was clear. This was not an impulsive decision, but a carefully considered strategy rooted in the belief that collaboration, rather than control, is the truFrom dreams to dynasties: The entrepreneur\u2019s true legacy\n\nWe live in a time of relentless change\u2014geopolitical instability, climate risks, technological disruption, and shifting consumer behaviours have made the business environment more volatile than ever. In such a context, clinging to traditional notions of ownership\u2014insisting on 51% control\u2014can be shortsighted.\n\nEntrepreneurs of our generation must recognise that resilience comes not from solitary strength but from combining complementary capabilities. In other words, two strong hands can steady the wheel better than one."

    "chunk_text": "Entrepreneurs of our generation must recognise that resilience comes not from solitary strength but from combining complementary capabilities. In other words, two strong hands can steady the wheel better than one.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, businesses today face rising energy costs, supply chain disruptions, regulatory reforms, and a fragile consumer environment. These challenges cannot be overcome by isolated action. They demand new models of collaboration\u2014models that encourage businesses to pool strengths, share risks, and build for the long term.\n\nEvery entrepreneur begins with a dream. Contrary to the common perception that wealth is the sole motivator, the real driver is often the vision of building something enduring\u2014an enterprise that grows, survives, and contributes beyond one\u2019s lifetime.\n\nThe truth, however, is sobering. Globally, about 70% of founder-led firms do not survive beyond the first generation. Only 13% make it to the third generation, and a mere 3% cross the century mark. This phenomenon\u2014sometimes referred to as the 30/13/3 rule\u2014remains one of the harshest realities of entrepreneurship.\n\nSri Lanka, too, has witnessed once-thriving family firms fade into oblivion, despite their historic legacies. The reasons are not always external\u2014taxation, competition, or labour issues\u2014but often internal: founder complacency, failure to professionalise, or destructive rivalries within families.\n\nThis is why I believe that for founders at the peak of their careers, decisions such as forming a 50:50 partnership are not about relinquishing control but about future-proofing the enterprise.\n\nJoseph Schumpeter, the father of entrepreneurship theory, argued that capitalism is inherently dynamic, driven by waves of innovation and eventually leading to its own \u201ccreative destruction.\u201d Businesses, like organisms, have life cycles: birth, growth, maturity, and decline."

By entering into an equal partnership, I am consciously choosing continuity over pride. It is not about diminishing influence but about protecting what has been built.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, the phrase \u201cfamily business\u201d often carries a somewhat dismissive tone, associated with small shops bearing names like & Sons or & Brothers. Yet globally, family businesses are the backbone of economies.\n\nIn fact, 35% of Fortune 500 companies remain family-controlled. In India, 79% of GDP is contributed by 65 family business groups, including giants such as Reliance (Ambani), Tata, Birla, Mahindra, and Godrej. Even in Sri Lanka, conglomerates like John Keells, Aitken Spence, and Hayleys started as family ventures before evolving into professionally managed corporations.\n\nThe real challenge for family firms is not starting or scaling but surviving succession. The so-called \u201ccousins\u2019 tournament\u201d\u2014conflict among second or third-generation heirs\u2014is one of the most common reasons for collapse. This is precisely why partnerships like ours matter. By combining two entrepreneurial legacies, we build resilience not just against market risks but also against succession pitfalls.\n\nWhen founders unite, they not only combine resources but also create checks and balances that force them to think beyond personal pride and family rivalries. They establish systems and governance that can guide businesses long after the founders themselves step away."

Both parties remain equally invested in success, which fosters a balance of accountability and incentive. It also encourages each partner to bring their best resources to the table\u2014financial strength, networks, innovation capacity, or brand equity.\n\nGlobal business history offers several compelling examples. The Sony-Ericsson joint venture combined Sony\u2019s expertise in consumer electronics with Ericsson\u2019s telecommunication technology, producing mobile phones that defined an era. The Renault\u2013Nissan alliance, though later evolving into a more complex structure, initially thrived as a balanced partnership that allowed both companies to survive and grow in a hyper-competitive automotive market. Closer to our region, the Tata-SIA Airlines joint venture (operating as Vistara) brought together Tata\u2019s brand legacy and Singapore Airlines\u2019 technical and service excellence, creating one of India\u2019s most successful premium carriers.\n\nOther global cases reinforce this point. The GlaxoSmithKline\u2013Pfizer consumer health joint venture created a global powerhouse in over-the-counter medicines by merging complementary product portfolios. In the energy sector, the BP\u2013Reliance partnership in India exemplified how international capital and local market knowledge can come together under equal terms to unlock vast potential.

How many of the 43 can vote at this session?\n\nThe answer is 14. That\u2019s way less than half, and slightly under a third.\n\nAs of now, it appears doubtful that even after a year in office, President Anura Dissanayake\u2019s JVP-NPP administration is able to position itself to pull Sri Lanka out of the losing spiral at the UNHRC Geneva we plunged into during the (Gotabaya-influenced) second Rajapaksa term through to the Gota and Ranil presidencies, corkscrewing from a winning high of 29 votes in May 2009, to 15 (2012), 13 (2013), 12 (2014), 11 (2021), 7 (2022) and 12 (2023) votes.\n\nIn 2006 the European Union (EU), through Finland, submitted a draft resolution on Sri Lanka demanding a field presence of the office of the High Commissioner in the country (A/HRC/2/L.37). This early date, when the State had hardly begun its fightback, reveals the hypocrisy of the Western assertion that its interventionist UNHRC resolutions are due to massive war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the Sri Lankan State during the closing stages of the war. How can that explain a 2006 EU draft resolution?"

How can that explain a 2006 EU draft resolution?\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s Far Right ultranationalist fringe, continues to criticise the winning May 2009 Resolution. The ignorant irrationality of that extremist criticism is amply demonstrated by the fact that the notoriously biased Darusman Panel Report of 2011 \u2018recommended that the Human Rights Council should reconsider its 2009 Special Session Resolution\u2019 (p 122). That was precisely because it was a resounding endorsement of and victory for Sri Lanka.\n\nAs for the 13th amendment which remains the hate symbol of the ultranationalist Radical Right, the EU Resolution of May 2009 presented by Germany (which was pre-emptively defeated by Sri Lanka\u2019s Resolution) irrefutably establishes the inspiration, origin and source:\n\n\u2018The resolution welcomed the reassurance given by the President of Sri Lanka with respect to his commitment to the implementation of the thirteenth amendment, which called for the devolution of powers to the Provincial Councils\u2019. (A/HRC/S-11/L.2, 2.)\n\nSri Lanka has had three distinct discourses and postures/modes at the UNHRC Geneva.\n\n(i) 2007-2009: unassailably broad, progressive, winning coalition of Global South + Eurasia, i.e., a NAM-SAARC-OIC-BRICS-SCO umbrella.\n\n(ii) 2012-2023: Israeli-type ethnoreligious ultranationalism; narrowing, failing, losing, residual coalitions (hitting single-digit in 2022).\n\n(iii) 2015-2019: appeasement and capitulation; Ranil-Mangala co-sponsorship of Western resolution."

Instead, Sri Lanka either rejects and fails, or appeases and capitulates.\n\nThough Velupillai Prabhakaran is a monster who murdered most of the Tamil democratic politicians, potential internal competitors, the LTTE\u2019s own negotiators, rival Tamil guerrillas, the Tamil political intelligentsia and Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s grandson, and lost the Thirty Years War decisively and utterly, much of the Tamil Diaspora and many Northern and Eastern Tamils still regard him as the hero of their \u2018nation\u2019, remember him, and revere him.\n\nThey also remember the role of Mahinda Rajapaksa.

He did address the Working Group, but nonetheless petitioned the Supreme Court on the grounds that he could not do so \u201cfully\u201d because the authorities (the Premadasa administration) had seized his dossiers of supportive documents.\n\nMahinda Rajapaksa addressed the UN Working Group on the disappearances of suspected JVP activists.

She said she sought further stay in the same place under new arrangements since moving out was difficult for her during her old age, surviving two bouts of cancer within 15 years.\n\n\u201cI even agreed to pay for repairs,\u201d she said, adding that she had already paid Rs.14 million out of her pocket for renovation, repair and refurbishment of it after it was assigned to her as her official residence in retirement."

What stands apart from and contrary to that universe is definable (and is commonly defined) as \u2018barbarism\u2019.\n\nWhat has happened in Nepal is the forceful end of the cycle of Left dominance of its politics. Not only is the deposed Prime Minister Oli a Marxist leader, even the once-iconic Maoist leader Prachanda (Pushpa Kamal Dahal) who was broadly sympathetic to the Gen Z uprising, had his house burnt. It is hard to imagine any Left party making a comeback at the snap parliamentary election scheduled for March. Nepal\u2019s politics is now predominantly post-Left, perhaps even pre-Left.\n\nFor the serious student of comparative Left politics internationally, and especially in the global South, the starkest contrast is between the failure of Left governance in Nepal and the durable success of left governance in the Indian state of Kerala. This once again brings home that what is decisive is not generic \u2018leftism\u2019 but the kind of leftism.\n\nKerala\u2019s successful leftism resides in a durable United Front. Nepal never stabilised a Left Front. Kerala has its own rational, progressive development model. Nepal never did, and veered way to the right of Kerala\u2019s. Kerala\u2019s leftism, primarily influenced by the CPI-M, was mature, measured, thoroughly democratic. Nepal\u2019s left, with a history of armed uprisings, was polarising, arrogant and leader-centric (Prachanda, Baburam Battarai, Oli)."

That question is distinct from and precedes that of the burning of Parliament.\n\nThe answer lies in an unacknowledged but fundamental factor: the Sri Lankan State inflicted incomparably fewer casualties on the protestors than in Bangladesh-Nepal. The Sri Lankan army did not open fire and shoot-to-kill, thanks largely to General Shavendra Silva who was criticised for that restraint by some high-ranking military hardliners. The Sri Lankan military hierarchy was well aware of the intelligence reports from within the army camps: sentiment was heavily in favour of the Aragalaya, and rising. Had the Police, STF or military fired on protestors and many deaths had resulted as in Bangladesh and Nepal, the armed forces would have given birth to a revolt from within, with rebellious units crossing over to the Aragalaya with their weapons, after having turned them on senior officers.\n\nHow was the Army rank-and-file in sympathy with an Aragalaya against one of their former officers Gotabaya Rajapaksa? Because he had implemented a \u2018shock and awe\u2019 attack on the farmers and thereby the rural communities with his irrational fertiliser policy, and the rural families of the soldiers kept them informed of the resultant harvest failure, their great hardships and suffering."

A guided bomb from an Israeli military jet hits its base, throwing debris, dust, and a cloud of ashen hell into the air. While the video captures the air barely clearing, and even as we get a glimpse of the building still managing to stand, a second bomb hits. The Mushtaha tower comes down on itself in an explosion that rattles the earth.\n\nThere have been mice inside the tower, and insects. Cockroaches and their ilk. These insignificant creatures stand no chance as the world literally collapses around them. With no one to explain what is happening, no one around to evacuate them, the mice and the cockroaches die in their hundreds and thousands, and the former tower becomes their tomb.\n\nThe Mushtaha is not the first residential building to crumble upon its residents in Gaza. We know it was not the last, and the way things are going, it seems many more will meet the same fate. But I know something that those who bring these buildings down do not seem to know, for I have seen the videos. Many videos, every day. It is not just mice and cockroaches that live in Gaza.\n\nTherefore, heed my advice, O Israeli soldier: be gentle with that trigger, for there are humans in Gaza.\n\nThere are humans in Gaza, living inside those very buildings, like Abu Salah Khalil and his family that lived in the Mushtaha tower. As reported by Al Jazeera last week, until they received evacuation orders just 30 minutes before the attack, the building \u201chad become a shelter for Abu Salah\u2019s family members, including his elderly parents, his brother\u2019s family, and his own wife and children \u2014 17 people in total.\u201d"

    "chunk_text": "There are humans in Gaza, living inside those very buildings, like Abu Salah Khalil and his family that lived in the Mushtaha tower. As reported by Al Jazeera last week, until they received evacuation orders just 30 minutes before the attack, the building \u201chad become a shelter for Abu Salah\u2019s family members, including his elderly parents, his brother\u2019s family, and his own wife and children \u2014 17 people in total.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wished I could embrace the house walls and tell them: stay strong and tall, don\u2019t be affected by the missiles,\u201d says Abu Salah. But the walls could not. The humans of the Abu Salah family now live on the streets, together with the mice and the cockroaches and the other displaced creatures from their tower.\n\nMarah Al-Haddad (11 years old) rescued from under the rubble by the men of Palestinian Civil Defence\n\nBut there are also humans in Gaza, dead under the rubble, like the extended family of Al-Jazeera journalist Ibrahim Al-Khalili. In the intensified bombardment of Gaza City that is happening as I write this, the residential block in the Al-Daraj neighbourhood they were living in got bombed to smithereens at night, while they were asleep.\n\nStanding next to the fresh pile of rubble, Ibrahim reports on video, \u201cMany Palestinians have been confirmed killed, and at least fifty Palestinians are still trapped under the rubble. Tragically,\u201d \u2014 and here he has to pause \u2014 \u201cmany of my close relatives were among those killed in this airstrike.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis area was once meant to be a place of refuge for many Palestinian families,\u201d he adds, \u201cand now has become a site of death and massive destruction. It has turned into a mass graveyard for Palestinians in the light of the unprecedented escalation of Israeli attack targeting towers, residential blocks, and shelter schools.\u201d"

Men who are trying to rescue her share frequent updates.\n\nIn the first, posted around midnight, they call out to her, and we hear her muffled voice from the depths below. Later we see the progress the men have made, clearing some of the concrete, cutting some of the bars. We see her face, with a thick steel bar blocking the view, and which she holds with one hand. Her other hand is held by a man, who gently strokes it.\n\nThe men talk to Marah kindly, gently, with love. Marah does not cry. The men use the lid of a plastic bottle to feed her water. The men keep digging. Ten long hours later, she is gingerly pulled out and laid on a stretcher. Marah will live, untouched by M\u0101ra, the Buddhist deity of death, for a while longer.\n\nBut there are also humans in Gaza, in rickety old vehicles, trying to flee death, like the small truck that burns on a narrow street on the day I\u2019m writing this. A family of five, including a child, leaving the city and the bombardment, has been targeted by a drone, and are burning alive. Their possessions still remain largely intact on the bed of the truck they have been traveling in, its cab now engulfed in flames."

Men still run in, trying to lift them up, to carry them to whatever fiction of safety they can conjure.\n\nThere are also humans in Gaza, sleeping on the streets or in tents, too tired to even fear the death that constantly threatens to rain down on them. Often, we have seen photos and videos of the night skies above them illuminated by flares. In one, we see a mother with her children, watching the slow descent of the bright flares, as if they were harmless fireworks.\n\nBut flares are the harbingers of far worse things, like the bombs that arrived for the humans in Al-Jundi Street at night. In one recent video from there, we see a father carrying his little son to the Al-Shifa hospital, his left leg a mangled mess from below the knee, hastily wrapped in some garment to stop the bleeding. The boy does not cry. He remains expressionless, as if he feels no pain. I suppose that is what they call shock, or is it something else: a spell of protection wielded by the love of his father that refuses to let go?\n\nLater we see the same little boy being treated on the hospital floor. It is the irrelevant things that draw my eye as I try not to look at what remains of his leg, such as the Sonic the Hedgehog t-shirt he is wearing."

Herzi Halevi, a recently retired Israeli general who served as the Chief of the General Staff and an executioner of the genocide, says the number exceeds 200,000. Some other studies place it north of half a million. We will never know the real figure as the carnage continues and confusion reigns, but at the end of this dark episode (for it must end at some point), it will surely be stated in hundreds of thousands, if not millions.\n\nAs I write this, the UN has finally declared what is happening in Gaza a genocide. It took them almost two years to recognise what was already apparent to most people within a few days or weeks. By the time UN got to it, a genocide had already been declared by the International Association of Genocide Scholars, Amnesty International, Doctors Without Borders, Human Rights Watch, International Federation for Human Rights, European Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights, and the Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention.

Vijitha Herath, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism at the 60th Session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva 8th September 2025\n\nI speak to you on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka at a time when my country has embarked on a historic journey towards transformational change. This journey is about democratic governance, human rights, inclusive economic growth and national unity.\n\nIn March this year, 3 months after the National Peoples Power (NPP) Government assumed office, I addressed the High-Level Segment of this Council and outlined the clear vision of the Government to bring in meaningful and progressive change that would advance the rights and well-being of all Sri Lankans.\n\nSix months on, as the High Commissioner presents his report on Sri Lanka today, I am pleased to share with you the tangible progress that we have achieved in translating this vision of change into a reality.\n\nPresident Anura Kumara Dissanayake was elected following the Presidential Election in September 2024. The subsequent Parliamentary elections in November 2024 established the new government with an overwhelming mandate from all communities in the country. It was the first time in the history of Sri Lanka that the people of the Northern, Eastern and Central provinces of the country extended such support to one political party.\n\nThe current Parliament is one of the most inclusive legislatures in Sri Lanka\u2019s history, with a record number of women and representatives of different communities. For the first time, two female members from the Malaiyahar community and a visually impaired person were also elected/appointed as MPs."

For the first time, two female members from the Malaiyahar community and a visually impaired person were also elected/appointed as MPs.\n\nWhen President Anura Kumara Disanayaka assumed office 11 months ago, Sri Lanka was grappling with the debilitating effects of an unprecedented economic crisis. The effects of the economic crisis and the fiscal measures implemented to address it were causing immense hardships for all segments of the population, especially the poorest and the most vulnerable segments of society. The immediate priority for the Government, therefore, was to alleviate the economic challenges faced by Sri Lankans, through a series of social security, welfare and empowerment measures.\n\nSpecial relief was extended to the farming, fishing and other vulnerable economic sectors throughout the country, while the 2025 National Budget made historic allocations for health and education. Increased funds were allocated for social welfare and security, while focused empowerment measures were extended to vulnerable groups such as women, children, including orphaned, disabled or autistic children, the estate sector population, students, persons with disabilities and people living in conflict-affected or underdeveloped areas of the country.\n\nThe Government has been actively working to develop infrastructure, support livelihoods and promote industries in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, aiming to enhance connectivity and support regional development. Rs.1,500 million has been allocated to meet the needs of resettlement, expedite the housing programme and provide essential relief to the families."

It is only if we work together as a nation and root out division, racism and corruption that we can achieve our national aspirations, including economic growth.

All of you observing the developments in Sri Lanka would have witnessed several examples in this regard.\n\nPermit me to briefly outline the key steps that the Government has taken:\n\n\u00b7 In the short period since the Government took office, a number of confidence-building measures have been taken, including reopening some roads in the Northern province for public use after several decades, and extending an open invitation to Tamil-speaking youth to be part of Sri Lanka police.\n\n\u00b7 Last week, President Anura Kumara Dissanayaka visited the Northern Province again, where he launched several development programmes and reiterated the Government\u2019s commitment to protecting the land, linguistic, and cultural rights of the people of the North and their right to truth."

The Government has and will continue to provide adequate resources for the related processes. During his visit to Sri Lanka, High Commissioner Turk had the opportunity of visiting the Chemmani site and getting to know the processes that have been put in place in this regard.\n\n\u00b7 The Government is committed to advancing accountability through credible domestic processes. Recent decisions by the Sri Lankan courts demonstrate the independence of the Sri Lankan judiciary.\n\n\u00b7 To further enhance the delivery of justice, a decision has been taken to establish an independent public prosecutor\u2019s office. Views have been sought from the general public and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka.\n\n\u00b7 The Government has afforded full independence to the Police, and investigations have been resumed into many longstanding cases, including the Easter Sunday attacks, attacks against journalists, etc. At the same time, we have not hesitated to take stern action against abuse of power by any public official.\n\n\u00b7 The ONUR is in the process of formulating an Action Plan on National Reconciliation with the support of the United Nations Country Office in Sri Lanka."

Our genuine and sincere approach, which is visible, needs to be reciprocated with deeper understanding and noticeable appreciation. We urge that all of you assist us in seizing this historic opportunity to advance the rights and well-being of all Sri Lankans through our own domestic processes."

The high commissioner also describes \u201croutine use of torture and other forms of ill-treatment\u201d and multiple cases of deaths in police custody, as well as \u201ca lack of effective investigation into these cases.\u201d The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka told Human Rights Watch in July that it reviewed 736 torture complaints last year.\n\nThe high commissioner found that \u201cthe surveillance apparatus, especially in the north and east, has remained largely intact, with minimal oversight or direction from the central government,\u201d\u00a0leading to continued patterns\u00a0of \u201cintimidation and harassment of families of the disappeared, community leaders, civil society actors, especially those working on accountability for enforced disappearances.\u201d Among those targeted are families of victims who have engaged with the Human Rights Council.\n\nThe government continues to suppress the activities of nongovernmental organizations and human rights activists. Many groups face limitations on their funding, while officers from the Terrorism Investigation Division often summon activists for questioning or visit their homes or offices."

Regarding the\u00a02019 Easter Sunday bombings\u00a0of churches and hotels that killed over 250 people, the high commissioner noted that successive governments \u201chave failed to provide a comprehensive account of the circumstances that enabled those attacks, particularly regarding the role of the security establishment.\u201d\n\nThe high commissioner noted that since Dissanayake took office last September, the authorities have made some progress in pursuing corruption cases but, like preceding governments, have failed to acknowledge the government\u2019s responsibility for abuses, particularly the role of the military and other security forces in serious international crimes. In particular, survivors of conflict-related sexual violence experience \u201cfear of retaliation, social stigma, and lack of trust in justice mechanisms.\u201d\n\nOngoing abuses highlight the importance of continued Human Rights Council support for the UN Sri Lanka Accountability Project, as well as the UN\u2019s ongoing monitoring and reporting, Human Rights Watch said. The council should call on the government to end the surveillance and harassment of victims\u2019 families and human rights activists and impose a moratorium on the Prevention of Terrorism Act."

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) hold an extraordinary parliamentary supermajority. This rare political opportunity provides the platform to enact long-overdue constitutional reforms\u2014reforms that Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam envisioned nearly three decades ago as essential to redressing the grievances of Sri Lanka\u2019s minority communities.\n\nYet, despite the scope of the NPP\u2019s electoral mandate, meaningful steps toward constitutional reform have been disappointingly absent. It is my sincere hope that this documentary will serve as both an urgent call to action and a source of inspiration\u2014encouraging the Sri Lankan public to hold President Dissanayake accountable to his promises and to advocate for Dr. Tiruchelvam\u2019s vision of a just and inclusive constitution.\n\nIn addition to examining Dr. Tiruchelvam\u2019s far-reaching proposals for power-sharing and minority rights in Sri Lanka, the documentary also features interviews conducted with people who discuss his international contributions\u2014most notably Dr. Tiruchelvam\u2019s role in monitoring Chile\u2019s 1988 plebiscite that helped end Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship, and Dr. Tiruchelvam\u2019s role in shaping Kazakhstan\u2019s post-independence constitution. These segments highlight how Neelan\u2019s constitutional thinking and moral vision transcended national borders and helped shape democratic transitions in various parts of the world.\n\nThe two-hour documentary concludes with a poignant and beautiful elegy by the acclaimed Sri Lankan-Tamil poet Indran Amirthanayagam."

A Burning Question For \u201cSystem Change\u2019\n\nDefeating all expectations of good governance on which the National Peoples\u2019 Power (NPP) and President Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) coasted to a stunning electoral victory in 2024, the NPP Government has stubbornly turned a deaf ear to public appeals to speedily appoint the Chair of the Right to Information Commission (RTIC) left vacant since March 4th 2025 and to fill long pending vacancies in the senior legal staff of the Commission.\n\nThese appeals include a recent Open Letter sent to the President and the Constitutional Council by one hundred and seventeen public intellectuals, lawyers, journalists, activists, trade unionists as well as former heads and members of independent constitutional commissions. Observing that the RTI Commission is \u2018a critically important independent organ that ensures the government\u2019s accountability to the public\u2019, the President was told that the acid test of a system change in good governance was whether the NPP will support or sabotage the Commission.\n\nThe signatories called upon the Constitutional Council, when recommending commissioners to the RTIC as well as the President, when appointing the recommended Commissioner/the Chair, to consider the candidates\u2019 proven track record of \u2018commitment to human rights and free speech, as well as their knowledge, experience, and proficiency.\u2019\n\nThis appeal follows strongly worded representations made to the Government by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, the Sri Lanka Press Institute comprising the Editors Guild of Sri Lanka, the Newspaper Publishers Society, the Free Media Movement (FMM) and other media associations\u00a0 as well as civil society organisations PAFFREL and Transparency International, Sri Lanka on similar lines. The necessity to immediately fill the vacant seat of Chair, RTIC from among the sitting Commissioners was emphasized in common."

The necessity to immediately fill the vacant seat of Chair, RTIC from among the sitting Commissioners was emphasized in common.\n\nThis has been met with resistance from the NPP including the Presidential Secretariat refusing to disclose the names and expenses of officers attached to its media division. The Government has also refused to disclose the recent Memoranda of Understanding between Sri Lanka and India on crucial matters, including defence.\n\nAt a recent Cabinet briefing, the Cabinet spokesman was aggressively questioned by journalists as to why the Government is resisting RTI when previous Governments had not done so. An attempt to blame the Constitutional Council for the delay by saying that the Council did not include the NPP\u2019s selected civil society members and that the Council has yet not recommended a name as the 5th RTI Commissioner backfired when media personnel asked as to why the President was not appointing the Chair from among the existing Commissioners as per the RTI Act.\n\nThis came in the wake of public outrage over an attempt by the Government to appoint a former Secretary to the Media Ministry, Nimal Bopage during the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe coalition Government as Chair of the RTIC despite corruption allegations in a 2018 report by the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) headed by DEW Gunesekera. Reacting to fury by factions of the NPP itself against this move which was leaked, the Government backed off while Bopage whose anti-RTI record was well known at the time, also withdrew his application to the Constitutional Council."

The Court said that the Commission had followed its own principle in previous cases in ordering SLT to release information regarding the interview and selection of a candidate to a senior position which it had every right to do as a quasi-judicial body.\n\nThe Commission decisions were in response to appeals filed to the Commission by G. Surendra and D.J. Wijewardena, who served as Deputy General Managers of Sri Lanka Telecom when their information requests were rejected by SLT.\n\nSLT appealed against the Commission decision to the Court of Appeal citing the Right to Information Commission as respondent. President\u2019s Counsel Kaushalya Navaratne appeared for SLT. The appeals were dismissed by the Court.\n\nRecruitments of public officials are by public funds and the State must be transparent and accountable, the Court said."

    "chunk_text": "Retired Judges Should Not Perform Any Function For Personal Gain: Lawyers Collective\n\nLawyers Collective on the appointment of retired judges to positions in the public and private sectors\n\nThe appointment of retired judges, especially of the Superior Courts, to positions in both the public and private sectors has been a matter of concern to the legal community and the general public in Sri Lanka and elsewhere. Post-retirement appointments of judges create a cloud over the sanctity of their judgments, irrespective of their merits. They also tend to undermine public faith in judicial independence. It is worse when an appointment is made immediately after retirement.\n\nThis is not to say that the valuable experience and insights acquired by judges should be wasted after retirement. The country must make good use of their knowledge in a manner that does not raise the suspicion that they were not impartial during their tenure. There can be no objection to retired judges being appointed as members or Chairpersons of constitutional commissions, Commissions of Inquiry or institutions such as the Law Commission of Sri Lanka, provided they are appointed through mechanisms such as the Constitutional Council, which ensures a national consensus on appointments. Their expertise could also be used in legal education and training of judges and lawyers.\n\nThe Lawyers Collective proposes that retirement benefits for judges of the Superior Courts should be equivalent to the emoluments and benefits of judges in service. They should not perform any function that would bring them monetary gain, advantage, or benefit except as permitted by the Constitution or written law. These matters should be regulated by constitutional or statutory provisions."

    "chunk_text": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake Should Ensure Accountability For Past War Crimes: HRW\n\nThe government of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, which took office on September 23, 2024, has promised to address longstanding human rights issues that have plunged Sri Lanka\u00a0into repeated crises, Human Rights Watch said in its\u00a0World Report 2025. Dissanayake has pledged to introduce more equitable economic policies and to repeal the notoriously abusive\u00a0Prevention of Terrorism Act, but he has not backed accountability for\u00a0widespread rights violations\u00a0during Sri Lanka\u2019s 1983-2009 civil war between the government and the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).\n\nFor the\u00a0546-page world report, in its 35th edition, Human Rights Watch reviewed human rights practices in more than 100 countries. In much of the world, Executive Director\u00a0Tirana Hassan\u00a0writes\u00a0in her\u202fintroductory\u202fessay, governments cracked down and wrongfully arrested and imprisoned political opponents, activists, and journalists. Armed groups and government forces unlawfully killed civilians, drove many from their homes, and blocked access to humanitarian aid. In many of the more than 70 national elections in 2024, authoritarian leaders gained ground with their discriminatory rhetoric and policies.\n\n\u201cSri Lanka\u2019s multiple crises are connected by entrenched impunity for rights violations, discrimination against minority communities, and laws and institutions that seek to silence critics,\u201d said\u00a0Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cPresident Dissanayake has an opportunity to make real progress on rights if he carries out his campaign pledges, but he also needs to address the legacy of past conflicts and continuing abuses against Tamils, Muslims, and others on which he has been troublingly silent.\u201d"

The Dissanayake government has pledged to combat corruption and create more equitable economic policies.\n\n* Police and other security agencies harassed and threatened\u00a0activists and human rights defenders with impunity during 2024, particularly in predominantly Tamil areas in the north and east, including undue restrictions and interference in the financing of civil society organizations.\n\n* In May, the UN human rights office issued a report calling for the international community to undertake prosecutions and other accountability measures to address thousands of unresolved cases of enforced disappearance that occurred over decades during the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) uprisings, and the LTTE armed conflict. The UN Human Rights Council has extended a mandate\u00a0to monitor human rights violations and collect evidence of crimes during the civil war.\n\nPresident Dissanayake should begin to address Sri Lanka\u2019s many human rights problems by fulfilling and building upon the pledges he made during his party\u2019s election campaigns."
