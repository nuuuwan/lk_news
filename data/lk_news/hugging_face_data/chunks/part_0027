    "chunk_text": "We Buddhists believe in the ancient idea\u2014even though it is not part of early Buddhist teachings\u2014that we can share the merits accrued by our good deeds with other people, both living and dead. In the case of the former, we invite them to rejoice at what we have done, and through that mental solidarity, it is said that they reap the karmic benefits. In the case of the latter, we believe that in their new life after death, if they happen to be in a position to see what we do, they will still be able to rejoice in our good deeds and thus enrich their own karmic balance. This exchange is called pu\u00f1\u00f1\u0101numodan\u0101 in P\u0101li.\n\nSo, this year, as I join my family in offering the Ka\u1e6dhina robe to the monastic community of the small temple in our rural, ancestral village, I share the merits with people who have often occupied my thoughts in recent times.\n\nI share the merits with the babies of Gaza, born into a world that is burning and exploding, a world that is able to abandon them to starve to death, as happened to the infants in the Al-Nasr Children\u2019s Hospital, when the staff was forced to abandon the building and were not able to return due to intense bombardment, infants whose decomposing bodies were found later, lying on the beds they were left in, still connected to defunct medical devices.\n\nI share the merits with the toddlers of Gaza, in whom I see my own little daughter, in whose parents I see myself, who get bombed as they sleep at night in their tents, and whose pain as they get their limbs amputated without anaesthesia rips my heart, toddlers who get carried into the few barely operational hospitals, running low on staff, medicine, and resources, and die by injuries that should not cost them their lives in a humane world."

One of the best known and most popular forms of meditation is mett\u0101, universal love.\n\nOn this day after the Vap Poya day, as my family engages in the Ka\u1e6dhina ceremony, I will cultivate a mind of love towards the people of Gaza. Perhaps it would help me more than it helps them in any meaningful way, but at the very least it will ensure that whatever other work I do is done with a skilful frame of mind.\n\nIn my mind\u2019s eye I will see that tiny stretch of land hugging the Mediterranean, that ancient hub of trade and cultural exchange at the gate to West Asia, home to what used to be more than two-million people just two years ago, though that number is greatly diminished now in the genocide. I will picture the people of Gaza, young and old, men and women, and I will imagine bathing them in a gentle glow of love, where they shall remain safe from any harm."

I will picture the people of Gaza, young and old, men and women, and I will imagine bathing them in a gentle glow of love, where they shall remain safe from any harm.\n\nI anticipate that very last extension of mett\u0101 to a genocidal leadership would not be without difficulty, but then I shall think: If I were born where Netanyahu was, and if I were brought up the way Smotrich was, and if I were to end up where Ben-Gvir has, perhaps I too would be cultivating genocidal thoughts. As my Muslim brethren might put it, there but for the grace of Allah go I.\n\nMay Allah, the merciful and compassionate, help me cultivate a mind of love towards even those perpetrators of genocide on this Ka\u1e6dhina day.\n\nLegend has it that even the Buddha attempted, in his ever so peaceful way, to prevent the king Vidudabha of the powerful Kosala monarchy from annihilating Sakya, the small republic at the foot of the Himalayas from which the Buddha hailed.\n\nIn one story in the commentary to the Dhammapada verse 47, it is said that the Buddha was sitting by the side of the road, alone under the scorching sun, as the army of Vidudabha was marching towards Sakya. Vidudabha saw the Buddha and asked why he was sitting in the sun and not under the shade of a great Banyan tree that was just nearby.\n\n\u201cBe not concerned, great king. The shade of my kinsmen keeps me cool,\u201d replied the Buddha, it is said. Apparently Vidudabha was inspired by this conversation to not go to war with Sakya, at least for a while longer."

I am disappointed at the number of Buddhist Zionists\u2014an oxymoron if there ever was one\u2014we seem to have in Sri Lanka, but this appears to be largely a matter of ignorance (whereas I have nothing to say to those who are driven by blatant Islamophobia).\n\nIn the Netherlands, where I currently live, being Buddhist during genocide has meant, among other things, raising our voices against funding these crimes against humanity. According to research by the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations, the Netherlands is the largest investor in Israel among all EU states by a huge margin. Just a few days ago, the Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof, in an interview with Al Jazeera, denied that there is a genocide happening in Gaza. Perhaps he was more concerned about representing the corporate interests of the country than the public will.\n\nIn other words, the government that I pay taxes to is one that funds the genocide and helps perpetrate it. In that sense, I am responsible for what happens in Gaza, and it is my historical responsibility to protest against it. I will do so with the knowledge that I share far more with those who are being exterminated than the executioners empowered by my tax Euros.\n\n(The writer is a social anthropologist whose research interests are at the intersection of early Buddhism and contemporary Buddhist practice, particularly in the Sri Lankan forest tradition.)"

    "chunk_text": "Aruni Shapiro introduces Adam Smith to Sri Lanka\u2019s readers\n\nAruni Shapiro, sociologist cum advocate for liberty, has published her 10th book introducing Adam Smith to Sri Lanka\u2019s Sinhala readers under the title \u2018Adam Smith and the Wealth of Nations\u2019.1 Her previous books have been on diverse themes like guide to mental health, translation of fictions, translation of rare but valuable books on economics, and biographies. In 2015, as I have explained in a previous article2, she published the writings of the French economist and statesman in the early 19th century, Frederic Bastiat under the title Libertarian Economics. This was the first attempt to introduce Bastiat to Sri Lankan readers. All the copies numbering about 2000 were distributed freely to interested readers by the publisher, Sri Lanka Frederic Bastiat Society, of which Shapiro was one of the patrons. That shows the extent of her dedication for promoting sound and advanced economic literacy among the fellow Sri Lankans.\n\nTwo publications by the Scottish economist Adam Smith in the latter half of the 18th century have been responsible for carving out its own subject matter now we know as economics. One is The Theory of Moral Sentiments released in 1759 which critically examined the moral thinking of the time when he lived suggesting that conscience arose from dynamic and interactive social relationships which people sought to develop within themselves as a code of sympathy of sentiments. This was a philosophical work in which Smith explored the sources of the ability of the human beings, called Homo sapiens, to form moral judgments when they are born like blank slates without any moral sentiment at all. Hence, all the moral sentiments are acquired, argued Smith, by people while living as members of human societies through dynamic and interactive relations with each other."

Her simple language and attractive writing style have increased its value to readers\n\nHowever, writing such guiding commentaries also runs a risk, as was shown by many commentaries written on the most influential book of the 20th century, The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money by the English economist John Maynard Keynes, commonly known as Keynes, published in 1936. Like the Wealth of Nations, the General Theory was also a tedious reading not because of its advanced English but because of the complexity of the subject it covered. This was left to some of his followers in USA like Dudley Dillard and Alvin H Hansen to present Keynes in simple language to ordinary readers. Dillard published in 1948 a commentary explaining the General Theory under the title The Economics of John Maymard Keynes: The Theory of a Monetary Policy. Alvin H Hansen published a similar commentary in 1953 under the title A Guide to Keynes.\n\nSmith who joined Oxford University for higher studies found that it was not a fertile ground for one to improve his intellectuality. As he noted, says Shapiro, more time was spent on religious observances than intellectual discourses. This experience led Smith to make the hard statement in the Wealth of Nations that publicly funded education could not maintain the quality standards because there was no challenge for teachers to upgrade themselves through the fear of the uncertainty of their jobs. This applies not only to teaching but also to all other professions. What it means is that market driven discipline is the most potent driver for improving the quality rather than state patronage as is being demanded by professionals of the modern day"

He had earned sufficiently high income while he had been in employment. However, contrary to the basic tenet which he had presented in the Wealth of Nations that people do everything to ensure their own survival, he had led a very simple life and donated a large part of his income to his poor relatives and friends. Thus, he had died a poor man in the same way had been born a poor man.\n\nThe concept of \u2018invisible hand\u2019 that describes the operation of a free market economy without the intervention of any person or authority has been viewed as one of the main contributions of Adam Smith to the science of economics. Shapiro\u2019s chapter6 on invisible hand says that though it is being used by anti-free market economists to degrade the contributions of Adam Smith, he has used it only once in the Wealth of Nations. That is when he had argued for free trade as against the popular view at that time (and also, today) that imports should be restricted in the case of goods that could be produced locally to encourage the local producers."

    "chunk_text": "The concept of \u2018invisible hand\u2019 that describes the operation of a free market economy without the intervention of any person or authority has been viewed as one of the main contributions of Adam Smith to the science of economics. Shapiro\u2019s chapter6 on invisible hand says that though it is being used by anti-free market economists to degrade the contributions of Adam Smith, he has used it only once in the Wealth of Nations. That is when he had argued for free trade as against the popular view at that time (and also, today) that imports should be restricted in the case of goods that could be produced locally to encourage the local producers.\n\nIn a chess game, the player moves the chess pieces by deliberate action. However, in a complex human society, moving people within the society is not so simple as in a game of chess. It will become a failure, Smith had argued, when actions of social planners and human dynamism move in two different directions. Thus, the principles underlying the operation of the invisible hand are valid for a complex economy just like they are valid for a complex society. An economic planner will be successful in his enterprise if he directs the economy to facilitate the operation of the invisible hand. Such policy actions, though Smith had not explicitly presented, are known as market-friendly economic policies.\n\nSmith has said that businessmen are driven by an invisible hand to search for profits rather than a government incentive. This should be a learning experience for the present US administration which believes that it could develop a local production base if it restricts the import of goods that can be produced locally through higher tariffs. Shapiro says Smith has explained the fallacy of this belief in his The Theory of Moral Sentiments when he criticised the social planners who believed that they could change the behaviour of people by directing their work like a chess player"

One is the talent base of the labour, its skills, dexterity, and judgment, which is known as productivity of labour today. The other is how many people are employed in the production of that output. Thus, the wealth of a nation will be higher if the productivity of its labour is high and it has more people to work and produce its total output. Such a nation can provide greater welfare and conveniences to its people than a nation with a low productivity and a smaller number of people.\n\nAruni Shapiro has done a yeoman service to Sinhala readers who are interested in expanding their knowledge base in economics. Her simple language and attractive writing style have increased its value to readers.\n\nIn my view, Aruni Shapiro\u2019s book on Adam Smith and the Wealth of Nations is a worthy reading.\n\nEven a dedicated reader would choose to skip reading the whole texts degenerating Smith to the relics of the thoughts of economic history. What is necessary in these circumstances is for others to read them faithfully, and present to ordinary readers in simple language as abridged versions. These simplified versions with commentaries will help ordinary readers to fully enjoy the works of philosophers cum economists like Adam Smith. This is what Shapiro has done in her present publication"
