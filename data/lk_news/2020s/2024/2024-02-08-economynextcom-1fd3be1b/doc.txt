Sri Lanka CEB signs power purchase agreement with Rividhanavi

ECONOMYNEXT – The state-owned Ceylon Electricity Board has signed a power purchase agreement with Rividhanavi (Pvt) Ltd for a 100 MW ground mount solar project in Siyambalanduwa today (8).

“Power purchase agreement for the 100 MW Ground Mount Solar project in Siyambalanduwa was signed by Rividhanavi (Pvt) Ltd with CEB today,” Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera said on social media platform X (twitter).

“The project was advertised by the CEB in September 2022, evaluated in 2023 and was awarded to the lowest and successful bidder at the end of 2023.”

Wijesekera said Rividhanavi will also build the transmission line of 27.5 km for the project and transfer to the CEB.

Rividhanavi (Pvt) Ltd is a consortium of shareholders, Lakdhanavi Ltd, Windforce PLC and The Blue Circle PTE Ltd of Singapore.

Windforce said “the estimated total investment has been reduced to US $ 133 million due to the reduction

in the market price of solar equipment. We are pleased to inform that the project is scheduled for

completion by April 2026,” in a stock exchange filing. (Colombo/Feb8/2024)
