Willing to fill Sanath Nishanthaâ€™s vacant seat: Spouse

Spouse of late former Water Supply State Minister Sanath Nishantha, advocate Chamari Priyanka Perera said she is willing to consider the vacant seat of her husband only if the people of Puttalam district or the party request to do so.

She made her statement after visiting the residence of Anuradha Jayakodi, the security officer of the former state minister who died in a car accident recently.

"My husband did great service to the Puttalam district as well as to the people of the country. No one who sought help from him was ever turned away empty-handed. My children and I cannot believe what happened to him, and it is still like a dream. Even before my husband's death, some media have announced that I would join politics. No one has asked me when publishing such news. I have not made any statements to any media so far saying that I am joining politics," she said.

"Even though I managed half of the political affairs of my husband and worked as his personal secretary, I had no hope of ever entering politics. There is still no such hope. But if the people of Puttalam, the people of the country and the party leadership ask me to take over the position left by him and continue the mission of the people, I may have to think about it," she said.
