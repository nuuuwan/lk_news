Cops kneel in Supreme Court in apology for senior citizenâ€™s illegal arrest

Colombo, Feb 19 (Daily Mirror) - In a remarkable courtroom moment that has sparked conversations countrywide, three policemen tendered an apology while falling on their knees during a Supreme Court hearing involving an 88-year-old senior citizen they had previously arrested.

The gesture, which was seen as a rare display of empathy and reconciliation, has garnered widespread attention and praise for its demonstration of humility and acknowledgment of past actions.

Three policemen attached to the Narahenpita Police Station, a Police Sergeant and two Police Constables, tendered this unexpected apology to the petitioner Godwin Perera (88) as a part of a settlement reached between the parties into a Fundamental Rights petition filed by the petitioner in 2017.

In his petition, petitioner Godwin Perera stated that he had taken measures to inform the police about a person in trouble while collecting garbage. He alleged that he was arrested and detained by the Narahenpita Police and subsequently held in a police cell.

When the matter came up before the Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Justices Vijith Malalgoda, Achala Vengappuli and Arjuna Obeysekera, the petitioner expressed his willingness to settle the matter. The courtroom fell silent as the policemen offered their sincere apologies for their actions during the petitioner's arrest.

Court severely warned the three policemen to refrain from repeating similar offenses in the future.

Senior Counsel Vijith Singh appeared on behalf of the interest of the petitioner.
