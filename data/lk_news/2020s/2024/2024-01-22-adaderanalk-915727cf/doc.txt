Injunction order issued against Dayasiri Jayasekara extended

The Colombo District Court on Monday (22 Jan.) further extended the injunction order against the former General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), Dayasiri Jayasekara, preventing him from hindering the affairs of the SLFP Acting General Secretary, Sarathi Dushmantha Mithrapala, and submitting inaccurate recommendations to the Election Commission in relation to the matter.

The relevant order was issued when a petition filed by Mithrapala and Chairman of the SLFP former President Maithripala Sirisena was taken up in court this morning.

The case is due to be recalled in court on 29 January, allowing time for the respondents to file objections, if any.

The injunction order against Jayasekara was initially issued by Colombo District Judge Sandun Withana on 08 January.
