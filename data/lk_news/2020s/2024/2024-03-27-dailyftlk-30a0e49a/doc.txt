Claims future action will depend on instructions received from AG

In a statement released yesterday, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) General Secretary Sarathi Dushmantha Mitrapala strongly condemned recent efforts by various parties to smear the reputation of party Chairman Maithripala Sirisena and the SLFP on mainstream and social media platforms.

Mitrapala said that following Sirisena’s statement to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) regarding the Easter Sunday terror attack, the political party has observed false and distorted media content being disseminated about the statement on both mainstream and social media platforms.

On Monday afternoon, Sirisena appeared before the CID and provided a statement lasting over six hours regarding the Easter Sunday terror attack. The CID had summoned him to provide a statement regarding a recent comment he made, expressing his willingness to reveal the true masterminds behind the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attack if directed by the Court.

Speaking to the media yesterday Police Spokesperson SSP Nihal Thalduwa said the Police have commenced investigations into the statement provided by Sirisena.

“We will obtain instructions from the Attorney General depending on the findings. Future steps will depend on the directives received,” he said.

Thalduwa stated that he is not privy to the contents of Sirisena’s statement and emphasised that it is not feasible to disclose the information to the media.
