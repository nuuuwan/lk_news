ComBank boosts digital banking with ‘Pay and Win’ and ‘Transact and Win’ promos

The electricity bills of 300 customers will be wiped out, and three customers will each win a tour package for two to Singapore under an exciting new campaign launched by the Commercial Bank of Ceylon to promote the use of ‘ComBank Digital’ – Sri Lanka’s most-used digital banking platform.

The bank has announced that these valuable prizes will be offered under two promotions – ‘Pay and Win’ and ‘Transact and Win’ – that will run till the end of August, and will be open to all existing users of ComBank Digital as well as new registrants that meet the eligibility criteria.

Under the ‘Pay and Win’ promotion, Commercial Bank will provide cashbacks of up to Rs. 10,000 to 300 customers that pay their electricity bills via ComBank Digital in June, July, and August, rewarding 100 customers each month.

Running concurrently, the ‘Transact and Win’ promotion is for customers that perform five or more transactions, including three utility bill payments per month, for three consecutive months. They will go into a draw and three lucky winners will be selected to win six Singapore tour packages.

“ComBank Digital already processes an average of more than four million transactions each month, and our objective is to boost this figure further with an incentive,” Commercial Bank Assistant General Manager – Digital Banking Pradeep Banduwansa said. “This campaign will stimulate wider use of ComBank Digital, enabling more people to experience its features, functionality, and convenience, with the added benefit of winning exciting prizes and cashbacks.”

The flagship digital product of the bank – the trilingual ComBank Digital app – now serves over 1.3 million registered customers and recently introduced card activation and card blocking features from the app. ComBank Digital users can now activate their new ComBank cards instantly, without having to call the bank or visit an ATM. They can also block their cards immediately through the app if a card is lost or stolen, and request a replacement card via the app.

An integration of all online and mobile banking channels on a single omni-channel platform, ComBank Digital is offered via a responsive web application and three native mobile applications (iOS, Android, and Huawei), enabling access across all devices such as desktop PCs, laptop computers, tabs, and smartphones.

Commercial Bank customers enjoy the convenience of self-registration for ComBank Digital, gaining instant access to a banking platform that is secured with industry-level security standards to provide a convenient, swift, and safe digital 24x7, 365-day banking experience, wherever they are in the world.

The bank said new customers can register for ComBank Digital without the first-year annual fee and joining fee to experience its convenience, and that a range of new features, benefits, and offers are planned in the near future for users of the platform.
