Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and 160 devotees fly SriLankan Airlines for their Sri Lanka visit

SriLankan Airlines was privileged to be selected by the spiritual leader and founder of the Art of Living Foundation, Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, accompanied by 160 of his devotees, for their recent visit to Sri Lanka. The Art of Living, one of the world’s largest volunteer-driven non-profit organizations, has been actively working in Sri Lanka to create a stress-free, violence-free, healthier and happier society.

Gurudev and his devotees were welcomed at Bangalore International Airport onboard UL 172 by the airline’s Bangalore team on 18 May 2024. SriLankan ensured that their journey was comfortable and seamless, catering to their specific dietary preferences with all vegetarian meals while providing the highest care and attention throughout their travel. The entire trip is being managed by Art of Living’s in-house travel agency, Sumeru Travels.

SriLankan Airlines is committed to connecting special groups from Karnataka with Sri Lanka and will continue to collaborate with Sumeru Travel to ensure seamless air services between the two countries.

Gurudev’s visit symbolizes the cultural and spiritual ties between Sri Lanka and India, further strengthening the bond between the two nations. Gurudev addressed a public meeting at an event titled ‘Ekamuthuva’ at Taj Samudra on 19 May 2024. As part of the visit, Gurudev will also grace the ‘Kumbabishekam’ event in Seetha Amman temple in Nuwara Eliya and bless the community.
