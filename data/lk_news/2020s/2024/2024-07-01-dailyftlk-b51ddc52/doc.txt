Sajith promised estate workers ownership of small estates under future SJB Govt.: TPA

The Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) MP M. Udhayakumar has said Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leader Sajith Premadasa has given written assurance to the TPA that in a future SJB Government, steps will be taken to enable estate workers to become owners of small estates.

The MP made this claim while attending a political talk show on a private radio channel on Saturday.

During the show, the MP emphasised that estate workers are weary from protesting for wages that meet their basic livelihood needs. He highlighted the cycle where increased wages lead to higher living costs, stressing the need to break this cycle.

The MP proposed that workers should receive maximum benefits from their labour, suggesting a solution by dividing current plantation estates and making workers small estate owners, granting them management responsibilities.

Furthermore, the TPA MP confirmed that Sajith Premadasa has committed in writing to implement this plan. He stated that both parties have signed an agreement regarding this initiative.
