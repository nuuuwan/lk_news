SLSI honours ComBank for its victory at Global Performance Excellence Awards

The Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) recently paid a special tribute to the Commercial Bank of Ceylon in recognition of the Bank’s victory at the Global Performance Excellence Awards of the Asia Pacific Quality Organisation (APQO) last year. Commercial Bank was one of only eight organisations named ‘World Class’ winners of the Global Performance Excellence Awards, consequent to a submission made by the Bank on the recommendation of SLSI, to the APQO about the Bank’s commitment to facilitate business excellence based on the Baldrige Excellence Framework for the SLSI’s National Quality Award (SLNQA).

The special award presented by SLSI at this year’s National Quality Awards to honour Commercial Bank for this achievement was accepted on behalf of the Bank by Ms Pushpa Chandrasiri, Head of Human Resources Management.
