Keheliya’s revision application seeking bail fixed for consideration

Colombo High Court on Friday (March 22) decided to consider the revision application filed by former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella seeking to be released on bail.

Accordingly, the revision application has been fixed for consideration on Monday (March 25) by High Court Judge Sujeewa Nissanka.

During the court proceedings, Deputy Solicitor General Lakmini Girihagama, representing the Attorney General, told the court that the prosecution has yet to receive the documents pertaining to the revision application.

Accordingly, the High Court Judge instructed the petitioning party to provide the prosecution with the relevant documents and ordered that the revision application be taken up on Monday for consideration.

Rambukwella, who is in remand custody in connection with the substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) procurement, submitted his bail application to the Colombo High Court last Friday (March 15) after the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court rejected bail for Rambukwella, former health secretary and 4 other accused in the case. Furthermore, the magistrate had ordered them to be remanded in custody until the conclusion of the case under the provisions of the Public Property Act and fixed the case to be recalled on March 28.

In his bail application, filed through his legal counsels, Rambukwella claimed that the Maligakanda Magistrate’s decision to reject bail for him was unlawful. He also sought the High Court to release him on bail subjected to any condition.
