Sri Lanka central bank buys US$121mn in July, taking total to US$1.87

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank has bought 121 million US dollars from banks in July 2024, taking net purchases to 1.87 million US dollars in 2024.

The central bank had to sell dollars on a net basis in June after an ealier spike in unsterilized excess liquidity and credit.

In order to collect reserves permanently the liquidity created from dollar purchases has to be mopped up.

Mopping up prevents domestic investments of the same amount, allowing the central bank to invest the funds abroad as reserves.

Sri Lanka gets about 2.0 billion dollars of current receipts every month, of which about 1.5 billion US dollars are used in imports now. Some money is also used for outward travel and paying bonds.

The central bank can collect reserves from whatever that is saved by recipients of US dollars and is not re-lent to the domestic economy to invest as credit.

In June the central bank had to sell 52 million US dollars on a net basis, amid a spike in credit and exchange rate volatility.

Sri Lanka’s private credit has so far been muted allowing reserves to be built, while state enterprise credit has declined.

As long as the central bank does not inject money through various liquidity tools to suppress interest rates (the policy rate or the average weighted call money rate), triggering excess credit generating balance of payments deficits and depreciation.

So far this year the central bank had operated largely deflationary policy, mopping up over 538 billion rupees of liquidity generated from dollar purchases by June at current interest rates.

Or order to buy dollars and meet an International Monetary Fund foreign reserve target the central bank has to run some kind of pegged exchange rate.

A clean floating central bank neither builds nor runs down reserves and there is no sterilization in either direction.

In consistently pegged regimes, the monetary authority also does not give significant reserves for private sector activity.

Any reserve sales leads to rise in the interest rate and a corresponding slow down in credit, keeping the exchange rate fixed and reserves largely intact.

However under a centrally planned policy rate, reserve sales lead to more injections to offset the sale and maintain the call money rates, driving more credit, more reserve losses and eventually triggering a currency crises and more reserve losses.

Rates are suppressed to depreciate currencies on various statistical doctrines that got mainstreamed from the 1960s in particular leading to the collapse of the Bretton Woods system and high inflation and depreciation.

These include ‘full employment’ policies, Mercantilist devaluationism for trade (REER targeting and basket band crawl), potential output targeting (a type of ‘full growth’ or real GDP targeting) and flexible inflation targeting (a type of real interest doctrine to generate inflation as high as 5 percent).
