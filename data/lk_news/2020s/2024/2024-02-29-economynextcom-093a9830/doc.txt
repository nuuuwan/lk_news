Sri Lanka wants to ensure absence major power rivalries in Indian Ocean: president

ECONOMYNEXT — President Ranil Wickremesinghe has highlighted Sri Lanka’s dedication to maintaining a strategic position aimed at ensuring the absence of major power rivalries and upholding freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean.

Speaking at the Pathfinder Indian Ocean Security Conference phase III held in Colombo on Wednesday February 28, Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka’s commitment to freedom of navigation has prompted the country to engage in operations as “guardians of prosperity” in the Red Sea.

A statement from the president’s office said that that Wickremesinghe had underscored the significance of the Suez Canal which he said was particularly evident during the Six-Day War when its closure for ten years negatively impacted the Colombo port. This highlighted the necessity of ensuring unrestricted navigation, he said.

Emerging issues including security concerns in the undersea domain, prompts a reassessment of approaches, said Wickremesinghe, adding that the future is in the Indian Ocean. Understanding Sri Lanka’s role within the broader Indo-Pacific framework was important, he noted.

The dynamics of the Indo-Pacific, originating from post-World War II arrangements such as the San Francisco system and the Shanghai communiqué, have evolved, leading to questions about the country’s positioning and potential involvement in regional conflicts, President Wickremesinghe said.

According to the statement, the two-day conference will see participation from delegates representing several nations, underscoring the significance of the Indian Ocean and its role in global security and supply chain resilience.

The imperative to reconcile varying viewpoints on the Indo-Pacific, particularly regarding its geographical limits and implications for maritime security was also highlighted by the president. Sri Lanka adamantly opposes the idea of confining the Indo-Pacific to India’s western boundary, stressing its wider territorial concerns that stretch to the African coast, he said. This stance diverges sharply from China’s expansive outlook, prompting scrutiny into the underlying motives and potential repercussions of these contrasting approaches, he added.

The importance of addressing emerging developments in the Indian Ocean amid complex geopolitical dynamics was also highlighted. This includes China’s growing presence, which is bolstered by infrastructure projects like the Friendship Highway in Pakistan and agreements with India concerning connectivity and harbour development, he said. The evolution of economic corridors such as the Mumbai-UAE-Israel-Europe connection, said Wickremesinghe, highlights the changing geopolitical landscape underscores the need for long-term strategic planning.

The interconnectedness of regional dynamics and the potential implications for maritime security and diplomacy, as evidenced by the recent conflict in Gaza, is also important, said Wickremesinghe. He caleld for a nuanced approaches to crisis management, considering geopolitical complexities and cultural sensitivities.

Wickremesinghe also called for cooperation among major powers rather than competition and outlined Sri Lanka’s vision for the region as a hub for economic growth extending beyond India to Africa.

On the resurgence of Asia’s influence, particularly China’s pivot to the Indian Ocean and the Belt and Road Initiative’s impact, Wickremesinghe noted the importance of re-evaluating traditional power structures and alliances. According to the statement, he also addressed Russia’s eastward shift and the evolving dynamics between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which further complicate the geopolitical landscape, calling for nuanced diplomacy and strategic foresight.

Reiterating ri Lanka’s commitment to promoting stability and cooperation in the Indian Ocean region, Wickremesinghe called for maintaining an inclusive approach that respects the historical significance of the Indian Ocean and considers the perspectives of its diverse stakeholders for long-term peace and prosperity.
