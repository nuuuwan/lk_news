Popular Youtuber Will Davis exposes data breach in Sri Lanka’s visa system

Colombo, May 9 (Daily Mirror) - Popular travel influencer Will Davis, also known as 'TrekTrendy' on YouTube, took to Instagram to raise alarm about a concerning data breach related to Sri Lanka's visa issuing system.

Davis shared his distress over receiving daily emails containing tourist visas, complete with sensitive personal information such as full names, addresses and passport details.

He said that despite having his visa approved a long time ago, he has been continuously receiving details of other applicants from VFS Global.

“Some of you may remember the Sri Lanka visa saga a few weeks ago. Well, whilst mine has long been approved, each day I’ve been getting other tourists visas emailed to me complete with full names, address and passport info. How is this a thing?! I’ve reached out in an attempt to try and make these stop but what a massive data breach,” Will Davis posted on Instagram.

Recently, VFS Global faced criticism for its visa issuing procedures at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) and the fees, following the circulation of a viral video on social media.

In the wake of perplexities surrounding the issue of the visa on-arrival, VFS Global has temporarily ceased operations at the BIA counter.

Meanwhile, the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security along with the Controller General of the Department of Immigration and Emigration have been summoned before the Committee on Public Finance (CoPF) today for a balanced inquiry into the ongoing visa fiasco.
