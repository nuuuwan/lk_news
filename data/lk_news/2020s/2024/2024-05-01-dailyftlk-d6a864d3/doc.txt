Court clears Mahindananda of money laundering charges

The Colombo High Court yesterday acquitted and released former Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage from the money laundering case filed against him.

The case was called before Colombo High Court Judge Nawarathne Marasinghe.

Aluthgamage had been charged for allegedly failing to declare the source of funds used to purchase a luxury house worth approximately Rs. 27 million at Kynsey Road in Borella during his tenure as a Minister.

The Attorney General had filed indictments against the former minister under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in 2017.
