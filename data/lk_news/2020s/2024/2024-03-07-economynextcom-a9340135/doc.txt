Sri Lanka president to discuss plantation worker wages with employers

ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka plans to facilitate an increase in the daily wage of plantation workers soon, with President Ranil Wickremesinghe expecting to hold urgent discussions with plantation owners,  Labour Minister Manusha Nanayakkara said.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday March 06, Nanayakkara said there has been progress yet on discussions already being held between workers, plantation unions and employers due to the two sides being unable to reach a consensus. However, according to the minister, an increase in wages is round the corner.

“The president instructed us to work towards increasing plantation workers’ wages. We discussed with workers, unions and employers. There is no progress on those discussions yet as the two sides couldn’t agree. Yesterday too we had a discussion and agreed to take their proposals and discuss those proposals with unions.

“In the meantime, the president informed me yesterday that he would talk to plantation owners and urgently work towards increasing workers’ wages,” said Nanayakkara.

“We plan to increase your daily wage very soon,” he added. (Colombo/Mar07/2024)
