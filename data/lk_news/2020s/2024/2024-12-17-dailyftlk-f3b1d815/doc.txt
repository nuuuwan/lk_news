Complaint lodged against Namal Rajapaksa over alleged Law College exam fraud

Citizen’s Movement Against Fraud, Corruption, and Waste Chairperson Jamuni Kamantha Thushara filed a complaint with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) yesterday, alleging irregularities in MP Namal Rajapaksa’s Sri Lanka Law College examination.

Speaking to the media after lodging the complaint, Thushara accused Rajapaksa of receiving preferential treatment during a competitive Law College examination held 11 years ago. He claimed that a witness is prepared to testify that Rajapaksa cheated during the exam.

“There is evidence that Namal Rajapaksa sat for the Law College exam in a special air-conditioned room, where he was assisted by two lawyers to complete the examination,” Thushara alleged.

He revealed that in 2012, a former student of the Law College attempted to expose the matter by filing complaints with college authorities, the Ministry of Justice, the Keselwatta Police, and even the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC). However, all efforts were reportedly ignored. Thushara also claimed the student faced severe repercussions, including abduction and death threats, which forced him to flee the country.

Thushara urged the CID to conduct a thorough investigation, expressing concern about the reluctance of the new Government to address such allegations.

“This matter raises serious questions about how investigations are conducted when the same officials remain in their positions. Justice must prevail, and if it is proven that Namal Rajapaksa’s law degree was fraudulently obtained, it should be revoked immediately, and all those involved should face legal consequences,” he demanded.

The allegations come in the wake of increased scrutiny of public officials’ qualifications, following the resignation of Speaker Asoka Ranwala over controversies surrounding his doctorate.

MP Namal Rajapaksa had previously called on Government MPs to resign if they failed to prove their educational credentials.
