Ranil trying to open doors to economic hitmen like Elon Musk: Hadunnetti

Colombo, May 31 (Daily Mirror)- President Ranil Wickremesinghe is trying to open doors to economic hitmen like billionaire Elon Musk, George Soros and James Packer by introducing the Economic Transformation Bill, NPP Economic Council member Sunil Hadunnetti said.

Addressing a meeting with the business community in Badulla recently, he said President Ranil Wickremesinghe claimed that Elon Musk is coming to Sri Lanka to provide WIFI.

"Ranil said in 2015 that free WIFI will be made available to all. He has now dropped the word 'free' and says WIFI will be given in 2024. Elon Musk will never give free WIFI," he said.

He said Ranil Wickremesinghe claimed earlier that James Packer is coming to invest in Sri Lanka. But he never came with any investments.

Hadunnetti said a publicity stunt is being operated through a separate company by using government funds to show that foreign investors are coming to the country.

"There are businessmen in the world who visit countries on request of the Presidents in those countries. But,they do not always bring in investment," he said.
