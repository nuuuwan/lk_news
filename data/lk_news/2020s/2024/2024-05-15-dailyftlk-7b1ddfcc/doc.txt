Easter attack like NATO

Every year around late April we all speak about the Easter bomb disaster which affected thousands of people in the country.

During that period there were several public requests for action to be taken against all who are guilty of failing in their duties.

In an article on 2 May 2019 which was published in the papers soon after the disaster where I clearly mentioned:

“It is absolutely necessary that those responsible, starting from the top two leaders and all others holding political office, be compelled by law to face appropriate penalties for their indifference and negligence.”

As it has happened in the last 75 years after Independence, whenever a disaster takes place in the country we talk about it for some time and conveniently forget about it.

I firmly stated that all 225 members of the Parliament were responsible for this situation and should set up a fund out of their own earnings on a long-term basis to ensure that the victims who are still living are provided to (details as per my article).

The main reason for the lack of progress in our country over the last 75 years is absolutely due to politicians and State heads who have shown indifference, negligence and inefficiency and get away without any penalisation.

We have seen how some of the Asian countries are even jailing politicians who have failed in their duties.
