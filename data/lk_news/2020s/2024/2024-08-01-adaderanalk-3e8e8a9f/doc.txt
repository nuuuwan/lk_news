SC grants leave to proceed with petitions by ‘Aragalaya’ activists

The Supreme Court has granted leave to proceed with the hearing of four Fundamental Rights (FR) petitions filed by a group of activists of the ‘Aragalaya’ protest movement today (Aug. 01).

These petitions have been filed seeking a ruling that their fundamental rights have been violated by the police unjustly arresting them during the protests held near former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s private residence in Mirihana.

The Supreme Court judge bench comprising Justices Vijith Malalgoda and Yasantha Kodagoda granted leave to hear the petition following an extended consideration of facts presented, Ada Derana reporter said.

At the same time, the judge bench has dismissed four other petitions filed with regard to the same incident.
