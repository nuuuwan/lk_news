Court rejects Arjun Aloysius’ bail appeal

The Colombo Magistrate’s Court has rejected an appeal for bail made by the Director of W.M. Mendis Distilleries Arjun Aloysius and two others, who were sentenced to prison on Monday (14) over VAT evasion.

Appearing for the defendants, President’s Counsel Razik Zarook requested the court to release the three defendants on bail since the trial against them has now become a criminal case.

Colombo Additional Magistrate Bandara Ilangasinghe, who stated that the relevant case has been filed based on a certification given by the Inland Revenue Department, rejected the appeal for bail, mentioning that the prison sentence is only an alternative punishment imposed on the accused and that therefore the case has not become a criminal trial.

The Colombo Magistrate’s Court sentenced the Director of W.M. Mendis Distilleries, Arjun Aloysius and two others to 06 months in prison for defaulting the payment of Rs. 3.5 billion in Value Added Tax (VAT) by the company.

The relevant case was filed against the company by the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) for defaulting the payment of Rs. 3.5 billion in taxes owed to the government during the period from 2016 to 2019.
