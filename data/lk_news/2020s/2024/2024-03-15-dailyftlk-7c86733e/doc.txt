BASL expresses concern over growing vacancies in superior courts

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) in a statement yesterday expressed its deep concern over the increasing number of vacancies in the Superior Courts, which has now reached a critical point that significantly hampers the functionality and the integrity of the justice system.

The statement issued by BASL President Kaushalya Nawaratne PC and Secretary Isuru Balapatabendi also said the following.

The recent retirement of a judge of the Supreme Court has further exacerbated the situation by creating an additional vacancy in the Supreme Court. This comes at a time when there is already an ongoing impasse between the Constitutional Council and the Executive over the appointment to fill an existing vacancy within the same court. The delay in resolving these appointments is not only undermining the efficiency of our appellate courts but also eroding public confidence in the legal systemâ€ºs ability to deliver timely justice.

We fully understand that the appointment of judges to the Superior Courts is a matter of significant importance that requires careful consideration, and adherence to the procedure set out in our Constitution. However, the prolonged vacancies and the disputes over appointments have now reached a point where they are crippling the functions of the appellate courts, thus denying our citizens their right to a fair and expedient judicial process.

Therefore, we, the BASL, call upon His Excellency, the President, and the Constitutional Council to take immediate and appropriate action to resolve the ongoing disputes and to fill the vacancies in the Superior Courts as expeditiously as possible. It is imperative that these appointments are made in a manner that is transparent, merit-based, and in accordance with the highest standards of integrity and independence, as these qualities are fundamental to the preservation of public trust in our legal system.

The BASL stands ready to offer its support and assistance in any way that can facilitate a prompt resolution to these issues. We believe that through constructive dialogue and cooperation, we can overcome the current challenges facing our judiciary and ensure that it continues to function effectively and justly.
