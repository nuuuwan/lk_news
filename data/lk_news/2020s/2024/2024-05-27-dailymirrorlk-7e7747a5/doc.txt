Driverless vehicles banned from parking at BIA arrivals lounge

Colombo, May 27 (Daily Mirror) - A decision has been taken not to allow vehicles without drivers to be parked in the arrivals lounge premises at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) (Private) Limited (AASL) announced today.

In the notice, AASL Chairman Engineer Athula Galketiya said the decision to prohibit vehicles without drivers from being parked in the arrivals lounge premises at Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) was made to alleviate traffic congestion and streamline vehicular movements.

Vehicles are required to arrive at the arrivals lounge only at the designated times for pickups. No permission will be granted to park any vehicle in the arrivals lounge for more than 30 minutes, even with the driver being present, Chairman Galketiya said.

He said vehicles parked for more than 30 minutes at the arrivals lounge, causing traffic congestion and disregarding the orders, will be charged an extra fee upon leaving the airport.

This measure aims to provide a quality service to air passengers and will help prevent the entry of unauthorized vehicles and individuals, while ensuring the safety of the airport as well, he said.
