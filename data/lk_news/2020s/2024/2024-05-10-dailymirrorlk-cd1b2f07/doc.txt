Tharshan Selvarajah makes history as first Sri Lankan to carry Olympic torch

May 10 - Paris-based Sri Lankan-born baker Tharshan Selvarajah has etched his name into the annals of history as the first Sri Lankan to be bestowed with the honour of carrying the iconic Olympic torch.

Some 10,000 people will have the honour of carrying the torch for part of its relay around the country, from ordinary citizens to VIPs.

Selvarajah's journey to becoming a torchbearer embodies the essence of the Olympic spirit. Having arrived in France for the first time in 2006, he embarked on a remarkable trajectory from humble beginnings to culinary excellence.

Initially working as a cook, Selvarajah's passion for baking soon led him to a bakery, where he honed his craft.
