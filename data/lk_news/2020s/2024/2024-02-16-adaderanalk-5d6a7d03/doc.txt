Another suspect arrested over murder of Buddhist monk at temple

The police have arrested another suspect who was complicit in the murder of a Buddhist monk at a temple in the Malwathuhiripitiya area last month.

Arrest was made during an operation conducted by Western Province North Crimes Division in Malwana on Thursday (Feb.15).

The 23-year-old is reportedly a resident of the Aralaganwila area.

He was apprehended with a locally manufactured hand grenade and more than 10 grams of methamphetamine (‘Ice’).

In the early hours of January 23, a group of four assailants, who had arrived in a car, shot dead a Buddhist monk inside a temple in the Malwathuhiripitiya area of Gampaha.

The 45-year-old Buddhist monk, Ven. Kalapaluwawe Dhammarathana Thero, who sustained critical injuries in the incident, had been rushed to the Gampaha Hospital. But he later succumbed to injuries while receiving treatment.

Earlier this month, the investigating officers managed to arrest five other suspects who were allegedly complicit in the murder. The T-56 rifle supposedly used by the perpetrators had been recovered from the possession of the fourth suspect, in addition to a live grenade, pistol, 3 magazines, 15 grams of heroin, 19 rounds of live ammunition, a motorcycle with a fake registration plate, remote switch of the car used in the shooting and a mobile phone.
