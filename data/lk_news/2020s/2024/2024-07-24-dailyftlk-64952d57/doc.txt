Bird Island in Beira Lake to be leased to Sri Jinarathana Vocational Technical Training Centre to boost tourism

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the lease of Bird Island, situated on Beira Lake to the Sri Jinarathana Vocational Technical Training Centre for a 50-year term.

“The island will be developed into a tourist attraction,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

The lease request was made by the Chief Incumbent of the Gangarama Temple, with plans to enhance the island as a cultural heritage site aimed at attracting tourists. Bird Island, spanning 143 perches on the southwest part of Beira Lake, was initially transferred to the Urban Development Authority in 2000 as part of the Colombo City Development Plan under the Beira Lake Restoration Project.

Gunawardena said the lease terms are based on the value determined by the Chief Assessor of the Government.

“This development is expected to contribute to the cultural and tourist appeal of Colombo, further enhancing the city’s vibrant landscape,” he added.

The proposal by the Urban Development and Housing Minister Prasanna Ranatunga was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
