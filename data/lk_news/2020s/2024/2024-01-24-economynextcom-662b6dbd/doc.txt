Sri Lanka central bank equity positive by end 2023, no need for govt capital yet: Governor

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank had positive equity in its balance sheet by end December and the central bank does not need a government capital injection, after losses made in debt restructuring, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.

The International Monetary Fund has asked the central bank to be recapitalized if its capital is negative by 2025, he said.

“If you look at end December balance sheet, we still maintain positive equity,” Governor Weerasinghe said.

“So I think there is no need for us to seek recapitalization at this point.”

Due to converting Treasury bills to bonds, the lower yielding bonds led to a large capital loss at current yields immediately.

The central bank, while losing money on central bank dollar swaps and dollar borrowings, makes cashflow profits on its Treasuries portfolio coupons, though at a lower rate than before restructuring. Foreign assets also bring profits.

“Going forward what we expect is with reserve build up and monetary policy operations we would be able to build up more of our equity and reserves,” Governor Weerasinghe said.

“If that trend continues, in the positive direction, I do not think we need to seek recapitalization.”

“What the IMF requires is if there is a need, there want the government to have a commitment from the government to capitalize.”

Governor Weerasinghe said the balance sheet was valued according to IFRS rules.

It is not clear whether the full loss has been taken to the balance sheet based on current market rules, as there are discrepancies between various published data on balance sheet items.

The central bank had equity of 24 billion rupees by end November based on the valuation of its domestic assets in the balance sheet.

In September before recapitalization, the bank had equity of 493 billion rupees. (Colombo/Jan25/2023)
