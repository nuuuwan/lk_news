Even IMF has accepted NPP will come to power: Tilvin

Colombo, Jan. 20 (Daily Mirror)- Most countries and organisations in the world, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have begun to realise that the National People's Power (NPP) will come to power at the next election, NPP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said today.

He told a news conference that the Samagi Jana Balawegaya is perturbed over the NPP's recent meeting with the IMF representatives.

Responding to a question on the SJB's claims that the NPP has not revealed the matters discussed during the meeting with the IMF and other allegations, he said it was not a secret meeting.

"We know that it is hurtful for the SJBers when the IMF representatives visit our headquarters and hold discussions. We are not concerned about their allegations. Only the NPP has revealed its policy and stance in public. No other party has done it. The IMF has accepted that the NPP will come to power next. That is why they discussed with us. We discussed the economic situation and the impact of the tax increase on the people, during this meeting with the IMF," he said.

Silva said most countries and organisations have initiated discussions with the NPP as they have begun to realise that the NPP will come to power at the next elections.
