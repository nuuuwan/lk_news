The US Secret to Staying on Top – My Talk with George Friedman

Forecasting geopolitics has been George Friedman’s life’s work; a historian renowned for his foresight into global shifts. In an era of global volatility, I had the opportunity to sit down with Friedman to discuss current world affairs, focusing on major powers such as the United States, Russia, and China. Notably, this was the first time he shared his insights on Sri Lanka, exploring its future in the context of a changing global landscape. As the founder of Geopolitical Futures and former chairman of Stratfor, Friedman’s experience and knowledge provided a comprehensive view of how global powers are shifting.

During our discussion, Friedman highlighted the surprising ways in which power dynamics have evolved, even beyond his own earlier predictions. Russia, deeply entangled in a prolonged war with Ukraine, and China, grappling with economic stagnation, have both faltered. In contrast, the United States, despite forecasts of decline, has reasserted itself with remarkable strength. According to Friedman, this resurgence is less about traditional hegemony and more about the unmatched economic and military power that the US continues to wield on the global stage.

Friedman reflected on Sri Lanka’s challenges as a small nation surrounded by larger powers like India, emphasizing the importance of strategic engagement. “A small country will develop in the context of larger countries. India is your neighbour. And India, like the United States, is ruthless in how it does business,” he noted. He advised Sri Lanka to avoid direct confrontations and adopt pragmatic strategies, while being transparent with its citizens. “Many governments, let’s say Sri Lanka, try to hide the pain… And then they get instability.” Reflecting on its history, he lamented, “Sri Lanka was a country that never found its place as it became a nation,” missing key opportunities to assert itself on the global stage.

Friedman also pointed out that many political leaders don’t approach governance with the mindset necessary for economic growth. “Political leaders tend not to be business leaders. They don’t think in terms of business,” he remarked. This, he believes, is a major obstacle to economic development in countries like Sri Lanka. Understanding how global business operates is crucial for fostering prosperity, and governments need to make strategic decisions based on that knowledge.

Despite the challenges Sri Lanka faces, Friedman expressed optimism about its future, highlighting the country’s beauty and the fondness people who have visited it share. “I’ve had friends who went there. It was a beautiful country,” he said. Sri Lanka, he believes, has great potential, but it must adopt long-term strategies and effective governance to realize it.

Turning to his earlier predictions about global powers, Friedman reflected on his analysis of Russia, China, and the United States. While much of his focus on these nations was correct, recent developments have altered their trajectories in unexpected ways. Russia’s war in Ukraine has stretched far longer than anticipated, and China, once seen as an unstoppable economic giant, now faces serious economic difficulties. As a result, rather than being weakened, the United States has emerged stronger than ever.

“The US has actually increased its power,” Friedman asserted, noting that America’s dominance stems from its unmatched economic and military strength. Economically, he pointed out, “China’s major importer of capital is the United States,” further illustrating how reliant global powers are on the US. This dominance, however, does not reflect traditional hegemony. Friedman explained, “I don’t consider this hegemony. Hegemony means that we are trying to create governments here and there. The United States is simply the most powerful economic power and the most military power.” For Friedman, this means the US doesn’t need to impose its will through coercion, as other nations depend on its economic and technological infrastructure.

A key aspect of Friedman’s analysis is his dismissal of the idea that the US dollar could be replaced as the global currency, describing it as “fanciful.” He argues that trust in the US dollar, along with the infrastructure supporting it, ensures its dominance in global trade. “Everybody accepts the dollar,” he said, adding that its strength lies in its stability, not conspiracy or manipulation. According to Friedman, efforts to shift away from the dollar are mostly theoretical, as no other currency holds the same trust globally.

Friedman’s assessment of China is similarly pragmatic. While China has made significant strides in building its economy and military, Friedman contends that much of this growth was due to its relationship with the US. “China’s economy took off because of the United States, because of American investment,” he explained. As a result, any slowdown in the US directly impacts China. Militarily, China is in a defensive position, particularly in the South China Sea, where it seeks to deter American influence.

Looking ahead, Friedman sees Poland emerging as a significant power in Europe. In his book The Next 100 Years, he predicted Poland’s rise, which recent events, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, have reinforced. Poland’s strategic position and growing military strength, coupled with its close relationship with the US, make it a pivotal player in the region. “Poland is now engaged in a massive military process. But it is also cutting free from Europe,” he noted, pointing to its increased leverage.

Friedman’s approach to Russia highlights the country’s historical insecurities and strategic miscalculations. Russia’s fear of invasion, stemming from past experiences with Napoleon and Hitler, drives its actions, particularly in Ukraine. Friedman explained, “Russia has been invaded twice… And in each case, they came up the same route towards Moscow.” This deep-rooted fear led to Russia’s aggressive response to Western influence in Ukraine, particularly after the 2014 uprising.

George Friedman predicted Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, driven by its need to “close off Ukraine, make no attack possible,” despite overestimating its military capabilities. He notes, “Sometimes the Russians make strategic decisions that they can’t support with their military capabilities,” pointing to the prolonged war in Ukraine as evidence of this miscalculation. Russia’s failure to grasp its limitations and adversarial approach to potential allies isolates it globally. Turning to the European Union, Friedman calls it “misconceived,” arguing, “You can’t have a banking system that includes the Germans and the Italians.” He highlights Brexit as proof that the EU’s structure fails to accommodate its members’ diverse needs, noting, “The British… could not live under the auspices of a central government.” Ultimately, Friedman is “very negative about the ability of the EU to survive on this basis,” questioning its long-term sustainability.

George Friedman argues that Israel’s intelligence failures stem from a deeper issue of focusing too much on military solutions and neglecting diplomacy. He believes Israel’s reliance on military responses has perpetuated a cycle of conflict, stating, “Israel has got to… understand that a military problem does not have to be settled militarily.” This, he claims, prevents Israel from turning adversaries into allies, as the US did with Japan after World War II.

Friedman also critiques Israel’s unwillingness to recognize its strategic failures. He observes, “The Israelis are not likely to recognize that they had a failure,” pointing to missed opportunities to prevent conflicts, such as the rise of Hamas. He suggests that resolving the Palestinian issue is key to any long-term peace, stating, “There could be [a solution], but recognizing that the Arabs will not give up until the Palestinian problem is settled.”

On broader global issues, Friedman addresses the necessity of selective protectionism, arguing that it is essential for national sovereignty. He challenges the blanket condemnation of protectionist policies, noting, “Each nation has different needs. It cannot throw its market open to everyone.” While he acknowledges the benefits of free trade, Friedman believes a balanced approach is crucial for safeguarding critical industries. He also emphasizes the importance of patience in economic development, remarking, “They expect miracles. And they don’t understand how long it took the United States or China or any of these other countries,” highlighting the unrealistic expectations many nations have in their pursuit of rapid growth.
