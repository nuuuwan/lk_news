Sri Lanka in talks for US$25 mn German technical university: State Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is in the final stage of talks with a German investor for a Technical University to be established in the suburb of capital Colombo, State Higher Education Minister Suren Raghavan said.

“We discussed about German Technical University. This is a US$25 million investment. They want to focus on agriculture, renewable energy, and food technology,” Raghavan told reporters at a media briefing in Colombo on Friday (05).

However, the German University is expected to start operations after the Presidential election scheduled for later this year, he said.

Sri Lanka has been in the process to attract more foreign investments into the country to prevent foreign exchange outflow and promote technical courses.
