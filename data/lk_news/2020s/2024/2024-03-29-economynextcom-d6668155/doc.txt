Sri Lanka electricity sector reforms bill to be gazetted

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Attorney General has issued certification to proceed with the new draft bill on electricity sector reforms, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said.

“Accordingly the new electricity reforms bill will be gazetted in the next two weeks and presented to the Parliament during the last week of April,” Wijesekera said on social media platform X (twitter.)

A progress review of the electricity sector reforms was held at the Ministry of Power and Energy with officials of the Reforms Secretariat Wijesekera said.

“Suggestions and issues raised by the development agencies and stakeholders were incorporated as amendments to the draft bill that was gazetted in December by the Legal Draftsman’s office and the inconsistencies in the Sinhala and Tamil translations were also fixed.”

Stakeholders, or any interested individuals, will have at least two weeks to review the gazetted bill, and two more weeks from the day of presenting it to Parliament to challenge the bill’s legality.

Once approved by the parliament, the new Electricity Act will enable the unbundling of CEB services, restructure CEB, improve efficiency, transparency and accountability and will allow private sector participation across generation, transmission and distribution.

A condition of the IMF program is reform of state-owned enterprises, including the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). (Colombo/Mar29/2024)
