Raffles Consolidated marks 25 years of excellence

Raffles Consolidated (Pvt) Ltd, a leading name in Sri Lanka’s hospitality industry, will celebrate its 25th anniversary on December 1, 2024. To mark this milestone, the company is preparing to usher in a new era of growth as it embarks on the next chapter of its journey.

Since its launch in December 1999 as an outdoor catering company serving an established corporate and upscale clientele, Raffles has evolved into a multi-segment catering leader, catering to three tiers of the industry: cafés, industrial catering, and premium banquets and event catering.

In 2001, Raffles entered the industrial catering segment by winning contracts to operate cafeterias for several leading establishments in Sri Lanka.

Starting with a single client serving 350 employees, Raffles now provides nearly 70,000 meals daily across multiple factories, offering breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Industrial catering has since become a core focus of its business model.

Reflecting on this 25-year journey, Raffles Founder and Chairman Tony Bohoran stated, “Our journey has been one of rapid growth and resilience despite the numerous challenges we’ve faced, including the pandemic and economic crisis. These challenges tested our resolve, compelling us to adapt swiftly and think innovatively. I am proud to say we’ve succeeded in achieving all that – and more.”
