MAS partners UNFPA to advance women’s health

On 28 November, Global apparel-tech conglomerate MAS and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). This partnership marks the beginning of a year-long collaboration aimed at supporting women’s health and reproductive health.

The MOU consolidated a shared vision between MAS and UNFPA to increase investment into women’s health and wellbeing. It seeks to empower and encourage women and girls in the apparel sector to speak up and for corporates to create safe public spaces. Through the partnership, both organizations will work together to upgrade medical centers, conduct awareness programs, and establish wellness facilities in BOI zones accessible to employees of the apparel sector.

“Supporting women’s health and wellbeing isn’t just the right thing to do—it’s the smart thing to do for our communities and businesses. This partnership gives us a clear framework on how we can work together to make a meaningful difference. We’re proud to be part of this initiative, creating a positive impact for women, who are undoubtedly the backbone of the apparel industry.” Suren Fernando, CEO of MAS Holdings.
