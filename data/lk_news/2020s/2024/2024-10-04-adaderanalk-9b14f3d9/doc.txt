SLBFE pauses registration of migrant workers to Lebanon

The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) states that relatives of Sri Lankans working in war-affected Middle Eastern countries can access information regarding their family members or seek assistance by contacting the hotline number ‘1989’, amid the growing conflict situation in the region.

Speaking to reporters regarding the recruitment of workers to Middle Eastern countries, Additional General Manager of International Affairs of the SLBFE Gamini Senarath Yapa confirmed that worker registration for Lebanon is currently suspended.

“There is no immediate danger to Sri Lankans working in Israel or Lebanon despite the ongoing conflict situation. The Israeli government has implemented safety measures that all workers should follow. Relatives in Sri Lanka can contact us via the ‘1989’ hotline if they have any concerns,” Mr. Yapa explained.

While worker registration for Lebanon is paused, Sri Lankans wishing to return home can coordinate with the Sri Lankan embassies, he said, noting that although travel is available through Middle East Airlines, airfares are high due to increased demand.
