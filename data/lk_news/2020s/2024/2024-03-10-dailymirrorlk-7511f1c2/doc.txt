Who’s not moving on from ’timed-out’ celebration?

Mar. 10 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka secured a thrilling series win over Bangladesh on Saturday when they clinched the third T20 courtesy of a stunning hat-trick from Nuwan Thushara, but the brilliant performance from the visiting Sri Lankan team was probably overshadowed by the split opinions on the 'timed-out' celebration.

Sri Lanka captain Wanindu Hasaranga, after lifting the T20 trophy at the end of the post-match presentation on Saturday, handed it to Dhananjaya de Silva, who seems to be the designated trophy holder for the team when they pose for photographs, and then, in a surprising turn of events, the whole Sri Lankan squad, including Niroshan Dickwella, who didn't even get a game, appeared to be pointing their fingers towards an imaginary watch they were wearing.

While many saw the funny side of the infamous 'timed-out' celebration, which originated after Angelo Mathews was timed out by Bangladesh during the Cricket World Cup 2023, Bangladesh captain Najmul Shanto wasn't impressed by the celebration.

"They haven't moved on from the timed-out incident. I think we didn't do anything out of the rules (in the World Cup); they should come out of there and stay in the present," Shanto said during his post-match press briefing.

Angelo Mathews was once again injured during the 3rd T20, but what many wouldn't have noticed was the fact that Bangladesh fans chanted 'timed-out, timed-out' as the veteran was walking off in agony on Saturday at a time Bangladesh looked comfortable chasing down 175 on a really good batting wicket. There is a very good chance that this was the incident that triggered the 'timed-out' celebration from Sri Lanka.

The fans from both teams expect tension and aggression whenever these two teams meet due to the heated rivalry, but it was thought that the players from both teams have put the 'timed-out' celebration behind them -- well, only until the second ball of the series, when Bangladesh fast bowler Shoriful Islam brought out the 'timed-out' celebration after dismissing Avishka Fernando, who nobody knows what's doing in the Sri Lankan T20 side, averaging 11 after playing 35 matches.

So, Shanto is either slightly hypocritical or had a bit of a brain fade when Fernando was dismissed during the first T20, just like the Sri Lankan selectors who keep on picking Fernando.

After his controversial remarks on umpire Lyndon Hannibal at the conclusion of the T20 series against Afghanistan, Sri Lanka skipper Wanindu Hasaranga was handed a two-match ban.

In the pre-match media conference for the 3rd T20 Bangladesh, head coach Chandika Hathurusinghe was asked about his opinion on Hasaranga returning to the Sri Lanka team, and the former Sri Lanka cricketer and head coach claimed that 'he is another player for us, and we play what's in front of us.'

As blunt and honest as this response was, some felt it was slightly disrespectful towards Hasaranga, who is ranked second in the ICC T20 Rankings.

Hasaranga didn't hesitate to strike back when he said, 'It is just another series win for us, and our bowling attack was too good for them,' during his post-match interview after clinching the series 2-1.
