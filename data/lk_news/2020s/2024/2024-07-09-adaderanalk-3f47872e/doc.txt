Public sector employees including teachers and postal workers report ‘sick’

Over 200 public sector trade unions, including Grama Niladhari officers will continue their trade union action by reporting ‘sick leave’ for the second consecutive day today (09).

The State and Provincial Public Service Unions Collective launched a trade union action to report ‘sick leave’ yesterday (08) demanding an allowance of Rs. 25,000 for all public sector employees, similar to that was given for the executive officers.

Accordingly, government officials across several sectors did not show up for work yesterday leading to a significant disruption in the daily operations of these institutions including the Department of Registration of Persons and Immigration Department.

In support of this action, the postal workers began a strike action last Sunday (07). The co-convener of the United Postal Trade Unions’ Front Chinthaka Bandara mentioned that their strike will continue until midnight today.

Meanwhile, the teacher-principal trade unions have also decided to report ‘sick leave’ today. General Secretary of the Ceylon Teachers’ Union (CTU) Joseph Stalin stated that they will continue the trade union action if their demands are not met.

However, State Minister for Finance Shehan Semasinghe emphasized that due to the prevailing economic condition of the country, it is not feasible to meet the demands of government officers.
