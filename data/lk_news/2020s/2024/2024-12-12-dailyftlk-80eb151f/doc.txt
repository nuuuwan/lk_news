Shan Meemanage wins award for innovation in shellfish farming and exports from Sri Lanka

Tropical Shellfish Ltd., established in 2015 by Shan Meemanage – a distinguished leader in Sri Lanka’s seafood export industry – has been named the winner of the ‘Most Innovative Shellfish Farming and Export Company of the Year – Asia Award 2024’ by the Business World International Organisation.

The awards ceremony, which will be held in Bangkok, Thailand on 25 January 2025, celebrates Meemanage’s exceptional contributions to sustainable aquaculture and innovative practices that have revolutionised the seafood export industry in Asia.

The award will be granted by Thailand Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and the occasion will be graced by King of Thailand Vajiralongkorn.

Meemanage’s groundbreaking model of cultivating giant freshwater prawns in open reservoirs – the world’s first and only such initiative – has positioned him as the largest exporter of these prawns to Thailand, a milestone he pioneered from Sri Lanka. This sustainable approach involves thousands of local fishermen, transforming livelihoods while earning global recognition.

With over three decades of experience, Meemanage has been a driving force behind Sri Lanka’s seafood export sector. Under his visionary leadership, Sri Lanka has become renowned globally for exporting premium seafood delicacies, including giant freshwater prawns, Sri Lankan mud crabs, oysters, and clams.

As the founder of Divron Bioventures, Meemanage has championed sustainable aquaculture practices that balance environmental preservation with industry growth. His commitment to innovation has positioned Divron Bioventures as a leading force in ethical seafood farming and exportation. In recognition of these efforts, Divron Bioventures was awarded in 2018 by President Maithripala Sirisena for its significant contributions to inland fisheries and aquaculture.

Meemanage is also the Co-Founder of Dutch Trails, a premier restaurant in Negombo, Sri Lanka, celebrated for its unique fusion of Sri Lankan culinary traditions with modern gastronomy.

Speaking on his win, Meemanage said: “I am deeply honoured to receive this prestigious award. It reflects my journey and the collective effort to uphold sustainability and innovation in the seafood industry. I dedicate this recognition to my team and Sri Lanka’s rich marine heritage.”

This accolade reinforces Shan’s reputation as a trailblazer in the seafood industry, whose commitment to quality, sustainability, and innovation continues to garner international acclaim.
