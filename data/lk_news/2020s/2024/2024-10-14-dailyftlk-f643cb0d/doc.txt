IGP introduces transparent selection process for police foreign training programs

For the first time in recent history, the newly appointed Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP) Priyantha Weerasooriya has announced a transparent selection process for Sri Lanka Police officers applying for foreign training courses and workshops.

In an official communique last week, Weerasooriya called for applications from police officers for foreign training programs to be held soon.

Moving away from the traditional method where officers were handpicked by the IGP or nominated by senior officers, Weerasooriya has introduced a mandatory interview process to select officers based on merit and qualifications.

The previous system had long been criticised for favouring officers close to the police top brass, sidelining others who might have been more deserving. Officers have often complained about the lack of clear criteria in the selection process, which undermined fairness and opportunities for growth within the force.

Under the new system, all officers interested in participating in upcoming international training programs must submit applications and face an interview board. Officers with the relevant qualifications will be selected based on their performance during the interview.

The Sri Lanka Police regularly receives invitations for prestigious training programs from countries such as Japan, China, Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea, and India.
