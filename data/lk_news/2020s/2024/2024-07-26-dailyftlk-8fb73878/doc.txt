Cabinet consideration of SC order on IGP undermines rule of law says YJA

The Young Journalists Association (YJA) a petitioning party against the appointment of Deshabandu Thennakoon as the Inspector General of Police (IGP) has said the decision by the cabinet to review the injunction order against Thennakoon undermines the law and judicial system of Sri Lanka.

Issuing a statement yesterday, the YJA said the Government’s opinion on the matter is unnecessary and said the President must immediately nominate a suitable candidate for the position and submit the nomination to the Constitutional Council as directed by the courts.

The YJA in its petition had maintained that the nomination of Thennakoon was unconstitutional and also questioned his referral to the Constitutional Council and his subsequent appointment as IGP by the President, based on a letter from the Speaker without the due approval of the Constitutional Council.

“This is a serious situation that should not be taken lightly. Instead of respecting the interim order issued by the Apex Court after a thorough inquiry, the Cabinet of Ministers has decided to take two days to formulate the Government’s opinion on the matter. At this point, the Government’s opinion is unnecessary.

Instead, the President should promptly nominate a suitable candidate for the position and submit it to the Constitutional Council,” the organisation said.

According to the YJA, the failure to do so and having the administration led by the President act in defiance of court orders, not only challenges the rule of law but also jeopardises the well-being of the country.

“The President, along with several members of the Cabinet, are legal counsel. Therefore acting arbitrarily in this manner is unsuited to their legal profession,” it noted.

The YJA urged the Government to not further undermine the rule of law and to immediately appoint a suitable person as the Acting IGP. The organisation said if the Government continues to act arbitrarily, it will take all possible legal measures against it.
