Will launch real ’Yukthiya’ operation under NPP government: Samantha Vidyaratne

Kegalle, March 31 (Daily Mirror)- Claiming that the 'Yukthiya' operation nets only the minor offenders, NPP politburo member Samantha Vidyaratne said the National People's Power (NPP) will launch the real 'Yukthiya' operation under its government.

Speaking at the Kegalle District Women's Convention, he said drug smuggling is directly linked with politics.

"Drug smuggling is interconnected with politics. The 'Yukthiya' operation only nets minor offenders. The real 'Yukthiya' operation has not been launched. We will launch the real 'Yukthiya' operation under an NPP government. All the drug dealers, fruadsters and criminals must keep that in mind," he said.

He also said that the underworld culture is also nurtured by politicians for their own benefits.
