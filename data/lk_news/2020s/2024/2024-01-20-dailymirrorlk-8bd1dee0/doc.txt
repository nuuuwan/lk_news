Changing agreement with IMF under Opposition leaderâ€™s government a mere slogan

Avissawella, Jan 20 (Daily Mirror) - statement made by the Opposition Leader about changing the agreement by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with Sri Lanka is a mere slogan, Finance State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

He said the Opposition Leader had made a statement that he will change the agreement with the IMF under his government.

Therefore, everyone should act responsibly at this time, the Minister said at a meeting in Avissawella today.

"At a time when the country was in trouble, the agreement made with the financial fund did good and not bad for the country and the economy," he said.

However, such statements are made for the sake of popularity and do not bring any good to the country, the Minister added.
