Health sector trade unions to meet Minster tomorrow

The collective of health sector trade unions have stated that the latest round of discussions with the health authorities pertaining to their demands ended on a positive note.

The trade unions met on Wednesday (28 Feb.) with the committee appointed to look into the demands of the health sector trade unions, under the patronage of the Secretary to the Ministry of Health.

According to the co-convener of the Health Trade Union Alliance (HTUA) Chanaka Dharmawickrama, the discussion also focused on the technical report prepared by the committee.

However, the health sector trade unions are slated to meet with Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana on 01 March, as he was not present at yesterday’s meeting, Dharmawickrama stated,

A collective of 72 trade unions representing a wide range of health sector professionals – including radiology and laboratory technicians, pharmacists and drug compounders, midwives, public health inspectors, and entomology officers – have engaged in strikes time and time again over the past few months urging the government to provide them with an allowance similar to that of the DAT (Disturbance, Availability and Transport) allowance given to doctors.

The trade union actions stemmed from the Cabinet Ministers’ approval of a proposal tabled by President Ranil Wickremesinghe seeking to double the DAT allowance paid to government doctors, raising it from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000.
