Sri Lanka to revive senior citizen interest subsidies?

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe has directed the Treasury Secretary to “develop a program to address” low interest rates paid to retirees, his media office said, raising questions whether a senior citizens interest subsidy scheme would be revived.

“For business development, bank interest rates need to be kept low. However, lower interest rates can disadvantage pensioners, so I have directed the Treasury Secretary to develop a program to address this issue,” the president said at a housing deed awarding event.

But real interest rates have been high over the past twelve months, amid good monetary stability provided by the central bank.

Sri Lanka’s 12 month fixed deposit rate was 15.09 percent in June 2023 and headline inflation, according to the Colombo Consumer Price Index, was only 1.7 percent in the past 12 months, giving real interest rates of 13.39 percent to a person who deposited money last year.

The central bank ended inflation around September 2022 after pushing annual interest rates close to 70 percent.

However, the fixed deposit rates now is 8.38 percent. The central bank has got legal powers to generate 5-7 percent inflation, though it has not done so up to now. (Colombo/Jul10/2024)
