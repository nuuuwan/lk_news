LTTE founding member Ragavan warns against common Tamil candidate’s rhetoric

Chinnaia Rajeskumar, alias Ragavan, a close early associate of LTTE founder Velupillai Prabhakaran and one of the founding members of the LTTE, has cautioned the Tamil community against the divisive rhetoric of the common Tamil candidate. Speaking at a press conference in Jaffna, Ragavan expressed concerns over the dangerous influence of a section of diaspora-backed agendas. As a member of the broader diaspora himself, he felt it was important to clarify his position. Ragavan noted that racism in the country has significantly decreased following the Aragalaya movement, with none of the major Presidential candidates promoting racist rhetoric. However, he criticised the common Tamil candidate for promoting ethnic nationalism and stirring Tamil racial sentiments, which he warned could have severe consequences. “The notion that Tamils should vote only for Tamil candidates and not for Sinhala candidates is both illogical and dangerous. If every ethnic group adopts this approach, it will only lead to further division,” Ragavan said. He emphasised that such rhetoric could undermine the country’s progress toward reconciliation and stability. Ragavan further highlighted that many parties that were former militant organisations aligned with the common Tamil candidate once committed unimaginable atrocities against Tamils. He specifically singled out EPRLF leader Suresh Premachandran, mentioning his involvement during the Indian Army’s presence in Sri Lanka. According to Ragavan, the involvement of such individuals makes it dangerous for Tamils to align themselves with this movement. Additionally, Ragavan questioned the MPs supporting the common Tamil candidate, challenging their commitment to the cause. “Why haven’t they resigned in protest if they truly believe in this cause? Why don’t they give up the benefits they receive as MPs, such as vehicle permits and bar licenses?” Ragavan asked, implying that these MPs prioritise personal gain over the well-being of the Tamil community. He also warned that the common Tamil candidate’s rhetoric could eventually incite racism within the Sinhala community, providing an opportunity for racist Sinhala leaders to exploit the situation and deepen the ethnic divide. “Racist Sinhala leaders will use this common Tamil candidate to stoke the flames of racism in the South,” Ragavan cautioned. In a bold statement, Ragavan accused the promoters of the common Tamil candidate of being part of “a collective theft” involving a section of the Tamil diaspora and a few individuals in Jaffna. He alleged that financial support from the diaspora is being misused for personal enrichment rather than for the betterment of the Tamil people. Ragavan concluded by urging the Tamil community to remain vigilant and avoid falling into the trap of divisive politics. He called for unity and a focus on progress for all communities in Sri Lanka.
