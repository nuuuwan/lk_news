Mireka Tower and Havelock City Mall earn prestigious LEED Gold Certification

The US Green Building Council recently conferred the LEED Gold Certification for Mireka Tower and Havelock City Mall reflecting its commitment to energy efficiency and occupant well-being.

The achievement of the Gold certification under the LEED 2009 Core and Shell Development rating system identifies Mireka Tower and Havelock City Mall as a showcase example of sustainability and demonstrates the group’s leadership in transforming the building industry in Sri Lanka.

From its inception, this project has incorporated green features and design optimisation, ensuring that both its construction and operations adhere to the highest standards of environmental stewardship.

Mireka Tower, towering at 50 stories, stands as a beacon of sustainable architectural excellence in Colombo’s skyline.

Together with the adjacent Havelock City Mall, which spans five stories and serves as a state-of-the-art shopping complex, the development features a unified central air-conditioning system with water-cooled electrical chillers.

This advanced system significantly reduces energy consumption while maintaining optimal indoor comfort across both facilities.

A high-performance building automation system (BAS) monitors and controls energy use throughout the entire complex, ensuring peak efficiency and operational effectiveness.

Unlike conventional buildings of similar stature, Mireka Tower and Havelock City Mall transcend the ordinary, embodying a commitment to environmental stewardship, energy efficiency, and superior occupant experience.  This pioneering approach not only ensures optimal indoor comfort but also delivers unmatched energy efficiency, setting a new benchmark for sustainable urban development.
