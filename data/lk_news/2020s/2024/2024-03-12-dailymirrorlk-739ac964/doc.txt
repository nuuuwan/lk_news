No tax on 92% of sanitary towels

Colombo, March 12 (Daily Mirror) - A total of 92% of the sanitary towels required in this country are produced in our country, and no tax is charged for them, Finance State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

While addressing a programme in the Thalduwa area, he pointed out that one company brings the remaining 8% of the imported goods to Sri Lanka as manufactured goods, and only 22.5% tax is charged for it.

That amount of tax is levied only for the purpose of protecting the local producer, the Minister added.
