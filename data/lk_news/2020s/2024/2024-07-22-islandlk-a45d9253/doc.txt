22A: The death knell of a vibrant democracy

1. The Cabinet Spokesperson announced that the Cabinet, at its meeting on 9th July, approved the presentation of the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution for the purpose of substituting “five years” for “six years” in Article 83B of the Constitution.

Confronted with strong public protests, the Minister of Justice, who had signed the relevant Cabinet paper jointly with the President, assured the Maha Nayakas in Kandy on 18th July that the proposed Amendment would not be proceeded with until the Presidential election is held.

He followed up by informing the media that he had directed the Secretary to his Ministry to withhold publication of the Amendment in the Gazette. Major media networks carried his announcement prominently in their news bulletins during the evening of the 18th.

Unbeknown to the Minister of Justice, just as he was conveying these solemn assurances to the Prelates, the President, giving short shrift to his Minister, was ordering immediate publication in the Gazette of 18th July. A bizarre caricature of the doctrine of collective responsibility, this sequence of events is an uninspiring demonstration of the chaos reigning supreme within the ranks of a dysfunctional Government.

2. The purported rationale for the Amendment is the need to resolve a conflict among several provisions of the Constitution.

The conflict, according to the Government, is between Articles 30 (2) and 62 (2), on the one hand, and Article 83 B, on the other.

3. These provisions have existed, side by side, ever since the 19th Amendment was presented to Parliament by the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, at the time Prime Minister, in 2015. For nine years, during which a Presidential election was held and a President assumed office in terms of the Constitution, there was not the slightest suggestion of a problem of any kind, at any time, in any context.

4. There is good reason for this: there is no inconsistency whatsoever between the constitutional provisions which are alleged to be in conflict.

Articles 30 (2) and 62 (2) define the duration of the Presidential term and the Parliamentary term, respectively, as five years. By contrast, Article 83B has nothing to do with the length of either of these terms.

Its purpose is entirely different: to set out the appropriate procedure, in the event of an initiative by the Legislature to extend either the Presidential or the Parliamentary term.

No conflict arises among these provisions because they deal with wholly different subject matter. Substantively and contextually, their objectives are entirely divergent.

5. At the present time, after the lapse of almost a decade, a compelling need has suddenly been discovered to address a supposed contradiction which, in fact, does not exist.

The motivation underpinning this attempt is mischievous, mala fide and contrived to serve narrow, partisan ends.

6. Successful enactment of the Amendment which the Government proposes, requires the fulfilment of two conditions:

(i) A two-thirds majority of the entire membership of Parliament in support of the Amendment;

(ii) Endorsement by the people at a referendum. Achievement of condition (i) must be compulsorily followed by the holding of a referendum within 30 days.

7. The adventure which the Government seeks to embark upon, involves two parallel, although independent, processes, each of them time-bound in terms of mandatory constitutional requirements.

The first step in the process is the publication of the Bill containing the Amendment, in the Government Gazette.

The Gazette was published on 18th July. No further action is permissible for one week. The earliest date on which the Bill can be presented to Parliament (for the First Reading) is 25th July. Thereafter, two weeks’ time has to be allowed for petitions to be submitted to the Supreme Court on the ground of repugnance to the Constitution. This period will expire on 8th August.

The Supreme Court is required to send its Determination to the Speaker within a maximum of three weeks. It is a reasonable expectation, in keeping with past practice, that the Court will complete its adjudication of the issue in approximately two weeks. This takes us to 22nd August.

It would then be in the latter part of August that Parliament will be able to commence the debate on 22A and take a vote at the Second Reading.

If a two-thirds majority of the total membership of Parliament is obtained, the referendum, which has to be held as a matter of constitutional necessity, will take place in the latter part of September – probably between 20th and 27th September.

The urgent Bills procedure, it may be noted, is inapplicable because of explicit provision contained in Article 122 (3) of the Constitution.

The Elections Commission was vested with authority on 17th July to issue the Proclamation which triggers the Presidential election. The Commission has announced its intention to make this Proclamation during the week commencing 22nd July.

The next step is fixing the date for receipt of nominations. The window for this is between the 16th and the 21st day – i.e. between (approximately) 11th and 16th August.The duration of the campaign is a minimum of 28 days and a maximum of 42 days. These timeframes, spelt out by the law, are inflexible.

This means that the Presidential election will take place during the last week of September or the first week of October on a date determined by the Elections Commission.

8. There are two parallel processes, then, culminating in the following result:

(a) A referendum to be held, approximately between 20th and 27th September;

(b) A Presidential election to be held, approximately between 27th September and 7th October.

9. The problem has only to be stated, for the absurdity of the resulting situation to become manifest.

The Government’s strategy, if allowed to proceed unimpeded, will necessarily have the consequence that TWO national elections are held within the space of about 10 days:

(i) The Presidential election, naturally the focus of nationwide interest and enthusiasm;

(ii) A referendum bereft of the slightest interest on anyone’s part.

The conflation of these two elections, to be held almost simultaneously, cannot but lead to total confusion in the public mind – not fortuitous or coincidental, but the calculated aim of this Machiavellian initiative.

10. What makes this exercise truly despicable is the callous disregard of the wasteful expenditure of the colossal sum of Rs.10,000 million – the yield of oppressive taxation – on the holding of a referendum devoid of any value or utility.

This is to be condemned all the more emphatically, occurring as it does in a setting where elections to 343 local authorities – performing functions characterised by the Supreme Court as being vital for the country’s citizenry “from the cradle to the grave” – have been indefinitely postponed, purportedly for lack of resources, in blatant defiance of the law and an explicit direction by the Supreme Court, addressed to the Minister of Finance and the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, to release the funds for the holding of these elections without delay.

11. This effort must be viewed not in isolation but as an integral element of a continuing series of events, which include proxy litigation by parties contending that their fundamental rights are breached by the holding of elections on time and by the persistent attempt to have the term of a pliant Attorney-General extended beyond the date of his compulsory retirement, diametrically contrary to unbroken precedent over a span of 76 years.

The country certainly owes a deep debt of gratitude to the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Council for their unwavering commitment to constitutional principle and core democratic traditions which represent the most cherished aspect of our nation’s heritage: indisputably, it was their finest hour.

12. In these circumstances, the most effective means of defeating the Government’s desperate adventure at the eleventh hour, are as simple as they are obvious: to withhold the required two-thirds majority.

In the absence of this, the effort is stillborn and cannot be moved forward one inch. The Government does not command a two-thirds majority in Parliament, and it is not merely unlikely but almost inconceivable that any Party or group in Opposition would acquiesce in a move that places in jeopardy the basic values that infuse and sustain the whole of our constitutional infrastructure.
