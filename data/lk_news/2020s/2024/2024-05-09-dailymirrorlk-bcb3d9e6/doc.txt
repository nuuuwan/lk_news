No import of vehicles expected in near future - Vehicle Importers Association

Colombo, May 9 (Daily Mirror) - While denouncing the false rumours regarding imminent vehicle importation, the Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka (VIASL) clarified that no vehicles, including lightweight vehicles, will be imported within the current year or before the election.

VIASL President Prasad Priyanga told the Daily Mirror that this decision was taken following a discussion held with the Finance State Minister yesterday.

"According to the discussion, vehicle importation will take at least another year. However, upon resuming importation, buses and lorries will be the first batch imported, primarily for tourism purposes," Priyanga said.

"Buses and lorries will exclusively be imported through the members of our association, with a maximum import time of one month. The discussion primarily centred around importing electric vehicles, although fuel-powered vehicles will also be included among them," he said.

We also discussed with the state minister on reducing the import tax imposed (18%) on importers when importing vehicles.

However, Finance State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said that the government is focused on resuming vehicle imports in four stages soon after receiving the report over the potential impact of lifting vehicle import restrictions.
