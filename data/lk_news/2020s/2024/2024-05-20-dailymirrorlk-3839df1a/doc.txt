Will stop MPsâ€™ moves to obtain vehicle permits: Anura Kumara

Colombo, May 20 (Daily Mirror)- Claiming that 82 MPs have requested vehicle permits, NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said they would take possible steps to stop the move.

He said adressing the pensioners national convention at the National Youth Centre in Maharagama yesterday that the National People's Power (NPP) will not obtain the vehicle permits.

He said they will request the Speaker to reveal the list of MPs who have requested for vehicle permits when vehicle permits have been suspended for the whole country.

"We are a group that expects a better life and good governance for the people. We must reveal the difference between the truth and falsehood," he said.
