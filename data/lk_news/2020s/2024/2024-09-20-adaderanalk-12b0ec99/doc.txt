No decision to arrest Shani Abeysekera and Ravi Seneviratne - AG

The Attorney General informed the Supreme Court today (20) that no decision has been made to arrest former Director of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) Shani Abeysekera, and former Senior DIG in charge of the CID Ravi Seneviratne, in connection with the investigations into the Easter Sunday attacks.

This was stated during the hearing of fundamental rights petitions filed by Ravi Seneviratne and Shani Abeysekera, seeking an order preventing them from being arrested in connection with investigations into a complaint made by a group of police officers, including former DIG Palitha Siriwardhane.

The relevant petition was taken up before a three-member Supreme Court judge bench consisting of Justices Preethi Padman Surasena, Achala Vengappuli and Mahinda Samayawardhena.

The Deputy Solicitor General, representing the Attorney General, stated that the CID has sought advice from the Attorney General regarding the investigations.

He further informed the court that the investigations are still in the preliminary stages and that no decision has been made to arrest the petitioners at this moment.

However, he added that if sufficient evidence emerges to warrant their arrest, a motion will be filed informing the court of such a decision.
