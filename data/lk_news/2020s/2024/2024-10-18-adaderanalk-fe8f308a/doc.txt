Notice on issuing vehicle revenue licenses

Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports, and Civil Aviation, Vijitha Herath, has directed officials to ensure vehicle revenue licenses issued in the Western Province are seamlessly connected with other provinces.

The Ministry of Highways, Ports, and Civil Aviation confirmed this in an official statement.

The ministry highlighted that the lack of inter-provincial coordination has been a major obstacle for vehicle owners, particularly those from the Western Province. Despite previous announcements to address this issue, the Western Province—the region with the highest demand—has yet to fully implement the necessary changes.

Vehicle owners in the Western Province who have vehicles registered in other provinces have long complained that obtaining revenue licenses is a cumbersome process, requiring significant time, effort, and money.

Addressing these concerns, Minister Herath has instructed the Governor of the Western Province to expedite the process and ensure coordination between provincial departments.
