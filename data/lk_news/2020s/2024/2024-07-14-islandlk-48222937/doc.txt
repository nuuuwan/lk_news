Mûve expands Lanka team amid UK sector growth and recognition

Mûve, a UK law firm specializing in property conveyancing since 2016, is bolstering its team of legal professionals based in Sri Lanka to meet increasing demands within the GBP2.5 billion UK property sector, according to a press release.

It said that the firm was recognized as one of the UK’s fastest-growing companies for the second consecutive year by the British newspaper, The Sunday Times, being the sole law firm included in their annual list of the top 100 fastest-growing companies.

Mûve has achieved impressive compound annual revenue growth exceeding 66% over the past three years, including a remarkable 27% increase in the previous financial year despite a 20% decline in national conveyancing volumes. This success is attributed to strategic investments in staff and pioneering technology advancements, such as the UK’s first digital remortgage transaction. With its ongoing expansion and dedication to innovation, Mûve is poised to secure a top-five position in the UK conveyancing sector.

The firm’s exceptional service is underscored by over 5,000 five-star reviews on TrustPilot, reflecting its unwavering commitment to client satisfaction.

Adam Gamage-Brooker, COO of Mûve, said that at the core of its success lies Mûve Colombo, established over seven years ago, where a dedicated and diverse team of over 450 professionals handles conveyancing including legal support services, client services, finance, and business operations. “We are incredibly proud of our team in Colombo and our continued success and growth could not have been made possible without them.

We are actively looking at expanding our talent and contributing to the country’s legal profession with our truly international workplace culture,” he said.
