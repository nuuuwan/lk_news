SJB and Maithripala refute alliance rumours

SJB says party has no intention or need to join hands with Maithripala Sirisena as reported

Says such claims are entirely fabricated and are being disseminated by Govt.-aligned groups

Maithrpala Sirisena says he has not made any decision to support a candidate in 2024 Presidential Election yet

The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has refuted claims that former President Maithripala Sirisena has joined their ranks in support of SJB leader Sajith Premadasaâ€™s Presidential candidacy.

In a statement released yesterday, SJB Media Spokesperson S.M. Marikkar accused Government-aligned groups of fabricating and spreading false news through both traditional and social media channels.

He said that the reports of Sirisena joining forces with the SJB are entirely fabricated and emphasised that the SJB has no intention or need to form an alliance with Sirisena.

Marikkar urged the public to remain vigilant against the Government, its allies, and their media propaganda machinery, encouraging people to critically analyse and understand the situation with discernment.

Former President Maithripala Sirisena also issued a statement yesterday addressing the rumours. He clarified that he has not made any decision to support a candidate in the Presidential Election set for next month.

Sirisena emphasised that the claims being circulated by certain politicians from both the Government and the Opposition, as well as by the media, are baseless and untrue.
