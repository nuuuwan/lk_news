Edith Cowan University Sri Lanka Campus launches Bachelor of Science in Nursing Studies

Edith Cowan University (ECU) Sri Lanka Campus, the fourth campus of Edith Cowan University Australia, is the only international university in Sri Lanka offering identical Australian degree qualifications, expert teaching, and modern facilities.

ECU last week announced the launch of the Bachelor of Science in Nursing Studies, the sole Australian Nursing Degree available in Sri Lanka, at ECU Sri Lanka Campus.

As the healthcare sector in Sri Lanka advances with enhanced facilities and services, there is a growing demand for professional nurses to elevate their education and caregiving skills. ECU provides an innovative and comprehensive educational experience, preparing nurses to excel in this critical and expanding field.

Dr. Sajani Dias, Dean of Academic Programs, stated, ” It is a fabulous opportunity for nurses with a diploma to advance their career with a top up degree offered by an Australian university. The program includes eight units emphasizing a wide range of patient conditions and their management. Moreover, the students could develop their academic writing skills to communication and also research methodologies.”

Students will develop a strong foundation in evidence-based practice, which serves as a cornerstone for considering research from a governance perspective of healthcare. The program explores clinical teaching principles, strategies, and the roles of various clinical educators and learners.

Emphasizing nursing ethics and practices, students will thoroughly understand evidence-based nursing through journal articles and research, enhancing their communication and presentation skills in practical healthcare settings. Academic assessments combine tests, quizzes, essays, case studies, and presentations, challenging students to apply their knowledge effectively. The program also integrates nursing theory and practice, encouraging critical and creative thinking to solve case-based scenarios.

The Bachelor of Nursing program offers flexible study options, including online classes, conducted by a panel of nursing experts, with guest lectures from distinguished professionals in the Sri Lankan University System and ECU Perth. ECU maximizes learning advisory, support, and counseling to help nurses develop their skills seamlessly.

The program fosters a professional nursing school environment where students are encouraged to engage in journal writing and participate in healthcare industry workshops. The collaborative culture with ECU Perth opens potential pathways for top-performing nursing students to explore international opportunities. Graduates of the Y61 Bachelor Program can pursue further studies through the Master of Nursing, opening postgraduate qualification pathways. Nursing graduates eager to advance in their careers will benefit from applying comprehensive nursing strategies critically and effectively. This degree program is a stepping stone for those nursing students who want to enhance their nursing career. However this degree program does not lead to direct registration as a nurse.

ECU’s vision is to elevate the education and professional standards of Sri Lankan nurses, aligning their values, services, and knowledge with the advancing healthcare sector. In an ever-changing world shaped by AI and technology, it is imperative for nurses to remain prepared for dynamic healthcare landscapes.

The Bachelor of Nursing Program at ECU Sri Lanka is now accepting applications from nurses eager to advance their careers. Interested students are encouraged to visit ECU Sri Lanka Campus for more information on entry requirements and program details.
