Political programmes presented by main candidates contain same thing – Dilith

The presidential candidate of the ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ alliance, entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera says that all the other three main candidates contesting the upcoming presidential election have presented the same programme.

He stated this during a public meeting held at Nittambu yesterday (11), under the ‘Dilith Gamata’ series of constituency meetings.

“Now they have presented three political programmes. All three of them contain the same thing. Instead, we have brought a strategic plan. A strategic programme that represents the views of every man in this country,” Jayaweera said.

He further stated that after the people vote on the morning of September 21, the results can only be expected on September 23 because of the second preference count.

“When you wake up on the 23rd, if you don’t see the ‘star’ in the morning sky, one thing is certain. The journey from a third world country to hell has commenced. But if you see the ‘star’ shining, it means that your life has changed from that day,” he said.
