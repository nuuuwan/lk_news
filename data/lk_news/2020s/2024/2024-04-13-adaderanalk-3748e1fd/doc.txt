Parts of the island to receive fairly heavy rains of about 75mm

Several spells of light showers are expected in Northern and Eastern provinces while showers or thundershowers are possible at a few places in North-central, Central and Uva provinces and elsewhere of the island after 2.00 p.m. today (13).

The Department of Meteorology says parts of the Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces, as well as Galle and Matara districts, are likely to receive fairly heavy showers of about 75mm.

Misty conditions can be expected at some places in Western, Central, Sabaragamuwa and Uva provinces and in Galle and Matara districts during the morning.

The general public is advised to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.

On the apparent northward relative motion of the sun, it is going to be directly over the latitudes of Sri Lanka from 5 - 15 April this year. The nearest areas of Sri Lanka over which the sun is overhead today are Kumulamunai, Murikandi, Keridamadu and Tanniyatttu around 12.10 p.m.

Showers will occur at a few places in the sea areas off the coast extending from Kankesanturai to Galle via Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Hambantota. Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places in the other sea areas around the island in the evening or night.

Winds will be easterly or variable in direction and wind speed will be 15-30 kmph.

Temporarily strong gusty winds and very rough seas can be expected during thundershowers.
