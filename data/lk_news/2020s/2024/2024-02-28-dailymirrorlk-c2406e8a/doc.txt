Court grants anticipatory bail on actress Damitha and her husband

The Colombo Fort Magistrate granted anticipatory bail yesterday, preventing Actress Damitha Abeyratne and her husband from being arrested until March 6. This comes following an alleged complaint accusing them of cheating Rs.3 million by promising to provide job opportunities in Korea.

Magistrate Thilina Gamage further issued notices directing CIDâ€™s Computer Crimes Unit OIC to appear before Court on next hearing date.

Senior Counsel Ajith Pathirana, appearing for Damitha Abeyratne and her husband, expressed his disappointment at the Inspector General of Police's decision to hand over the investigation involving Rs.3 million to the CID.
