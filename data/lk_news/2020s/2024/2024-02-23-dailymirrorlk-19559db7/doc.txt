No heatwave threat to Sri Lanka: Met. Dept.

Colombo, Feb 23 (Daily Mirror) - The Department of Meteorology yesterday assured that Sri Lanka is not facing a heatwave threat though it has adviced people in some areas to be vigilant.

"Heat index does not indicate a rise in temperature alone. It actually refers to the level to which the people feel the heat. People feel uncomfortable when their perspiration does not get absorbed by the atmosphere. Perspiration or sweat does not get absorbed by the atmosphere when the humidity level is high," an official attached to the Department of Meteorology said.

"In addition there is a drop in wind flow towards the island. This situation also makes people uncomfortable as they feel the heat," he added.

It was highlighted that the heat index is calculated by taking all these factors into consideration.

According to data released by the Department of Meteorology, the highest temperature of 37.4c degrees was recorded from Ratnapura, while Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, Polonnaruwa and Maha Illupulama recorded a temperature of 33c degrees as of last afternoon.
