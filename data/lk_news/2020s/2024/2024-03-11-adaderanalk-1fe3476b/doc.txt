‘Kudu Salindu’ further remanded

Notorious underworld figure and drug kingpin Salindu Malshitha Gunaratne, alias ‘Kudu Salindu’, has been further remanded on orders of the Panadura Magistrate’s Court.

Accordingly, ‘Kudu Salindu’ was further remanded until 25 March as per an order issued by Panadura Chief Magistrate Champika Rajapaksha.

Salindu Malshitha Gunaratne is currently in the custody of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), after he was arrested in Madagascar in March 2023.

Nadun Chinthaka Wickremeratne alias ‘Harak Kata’ and his infamous accomplice Salindu Malshika alias ‘Kudu Salindu’ were arrested in Madagascar on March 01 last year in a joint operation by the INTERPOL and Malagasy law enforcement authorities and Customs officials.

The duo was brought back to the island on March 15 after Malagasy defence officials informed the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry of the arrest of 8 suspects including the two Sri Lankan underworld figures.

The extradition process had been coordinated by the Sri Lankan High Commission in Victoria, Seychelles, as Sri Lanka does not have an embassy or a high commission in Madagascar.
