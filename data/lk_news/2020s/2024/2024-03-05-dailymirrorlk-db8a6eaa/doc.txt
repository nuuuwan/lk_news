No strike tomorrow; trains will operate as usual

Colombo, March 05 (Daily Mirror) - The railway strike, which was scheduled to be launched tonight by several railway trade unions, has been called off following a favourable response by the Transport Ministry, Locomotive Engine Operators’ Union (LEOU) secretary Indika Dodangoda said.

Addressing the media, he said the strike was scheduled to commence tonight over salary anomalies.

Therefore, the union had called for a strike, but since the Cabinet office has informed that the relevant decision will be sent to the Transport Ministry today, there is no need to carry out the planned strike, and the strike will be called off, the convenor informed.

Train services will operate as scheduled for the convenience of the commuters.
