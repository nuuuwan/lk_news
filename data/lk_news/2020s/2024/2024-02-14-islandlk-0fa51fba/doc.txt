AVOCADO… my favourite

Yes, veggies, and fruits, have come down in price and that would certainly make your daily beauty routine, using veggies and fruits, less expensive.

I love avocados and I try to have it, on a daily basis, with my breakfast.

Okay, now let’s check out some beauty benefits with avocado.

Mash up an avocado, put it all over your face and neck, and leave it on for at least 15 minutes. For extra benefits, you can add other pantry staples, like a squeeze of lemon juice, a bit of honey or a tablespoon of coconut oil.

Mash up some avocado and place it on the burnt areas; the antioxidants and oils will not only soothe your skin, but speed up the healing. For an extra boost, add a teaspoon of aloe vera gel.

Your hands are one of the first parts of your body to show signs of ageing because they are regularly exposed to the elements and tend to get dry, and rough, pretty easily. The moisturizing and nourishing properties of avocado will treat your hands like never before.

Mash half an avocado with some extra-virgin olive oil and a teaspoon of sugar, leave it on your hands for five to 10 minutes and then soak your hands in warm water.

Remove the seed and peel from an avocado and mash half the avocado in a bowl. Add 01 egg yolk and 01 tablespoon of honey to the mashed acocado and combine these ingredients well. Apply this mixture to clean,dry hair and leave it for 30 minutes. Then rinse hair thoroughly, and dry.
