Candidatesâ€™ representatives allowed to escort ballot boxes to counting centers

The Election Commission has announced that the vehicles carrying representatives of presidential candidates will be permitted to escort the vehicles transporting ballot boxes from polling stations to counting centers.

This aims to address concerns raised by some politicians and candidates regarding the integrity of the ballot boxes during transit.

According to the commission, representatives may follow the vehicle carrying the ballot boxes up to the last police checkpoint near the counting center.

However, in order to be allowed to escort such vehicles, an authorized representative of the candidate must submit a detailed report to the District Election Office three days before polling day.

This report should include the name of the relevant polling station, the vehicle number of the escorting vehicle, and the name of the representative on board.

A vehicle license for this purpose can be obtained from the Senior Polling Officer at the relevant polling station.

This decision comes in response to doubts expressed about whether the ballot boxes will be delivered to the counting center without any tampering after the polls close, the commission said.

Meanwhile, the Election Commission has reported that the number of complaints related to the presidential election has exceeded 3,500.

Between July 31 and 4:30 p.m. yesterday (Sep. 12), a total of 3,610 complaints were received, of which 3,047 have been resolved thus far, it said.
