Small elite group trying to stop the ’change’: Harini Amarasuriya

Colombo, March 17 (Daily Mirror)- Claiming that the change of power is not going to be easy, NPP MP Harini Amarasuriya said a small elite group is doing everything in their power to stop the change from happening.

Speaking at the London women's convention, she said the small elite group has been in control of what has happened in Sri Lanka for the last 76 years.

She said this small group will not give up easily, adding that people of Sri Lanka have now realized that they are stronger than all of them.

“The change is not going to be easy. There is a small elite group that will do everything in their power to stop this change from happening. They have been in control of what has happened in Sri Lanka for so long. They are not going to give up easily. But, People of this country is stronger than all of them. We have not realized our strength before. By coming together as an organized group, we are much stronger than all of them. They have ruined our country for the last 76 years. That era must come to an end. Ending that era is our responsibility. You can make that change. You must be part of that change,” she appealed to the Sri Lankan community living in London.
