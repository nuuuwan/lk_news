Supreme Court issues interim injunction on Excise Dept.

Supreme Court on Tuesday (02) issued an interim injunction preventing the Excise Department from issuing liquor licenses in violation of the provisions of the Excise Act of Sri Lanka.

The court order will be in effect until 10 May 2024, according to Ada Derana correspondent.

A three-member bench comprising Justices Yasantha Kodagoda, Janak de Silva and Arjuna Obeysekera delivered the interim injunction after taking into consideration three fundamental rights (FR) petitions filed by the Sri Lanka Liquor Licensees’ Association and several other parties.

Appearing on behalf of the petitioners, President’s Counsel Sanjeewa Jayawardena and several other legal counsels told the court that the Excise Department has been issuing liquor licenses in an irregular manner.

As such, the petitioning party requested the judge bench to deliver an injunction preventing the Excise Department from overriding the provisions of the Excise Act and regulations when issuing liquor licenses.
