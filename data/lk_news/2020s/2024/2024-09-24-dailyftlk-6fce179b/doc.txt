Veteran traditional dancer Vajira Chitrasena passes away

Veteran Sri Lankan traditional dancer, choreographer, and teacher Deshamanya Dr. Vajira Chitrasena has passed away at the age of 92.

Vajira and her husband Chitrasena are known for their close bond with India and for their contributions in strengthening the ties between the two countries in the field of arts. She made her debut as a soloist in the role of Prakriti in the ballet ‘Chandali’ in 1952.  Her rise to stardom was coupled with unswerving discipline and dedication as a teacher, performer, and choreographer, even as she illumined her husband’s career.

She was announced as an honourable recipient of the prestigious Padma Shri award for her achievement in arts in January 2020, and the award was given by Indian President Ram Nath Kovind in 2021.
