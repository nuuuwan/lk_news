Talks succeed, health unions withdraw strike threats

Colombo, Feb 19 (Daily Mirror) - Following successful discussions between representatives of the health sector trade unions and Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana, a satisfactory solution to the grievances has been reached.

Ravi Kumudesh, convener of the Health Trade Union Alliance, confirmed that the discussions with the Health Minister resulted in a commitment to address their demands.

Hence, the unions decided to refrain from any form of strike action for the time being.

Furthermore, the Health Minister also advised to appoint a committee to address the pressing concerns raised by the health professionals.

The unions have been demanding a similar increased allowance to the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance which was earlier granted to the doctors.
