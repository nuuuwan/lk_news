Diana Gamage MPs seat: SC indefinitely defers delivery of verdict

The Supreme Court on Tuesday (Feb.13) concluded the hearing of an appeal filed challenging the Appeals Court’s dismissal of a petition State Minister Diana Gamage’s parliamentary membership.

Appeal was heard before Supreme Court’s three-member bench comprising Justices Gamini Amarasekara, Kumudini Wickramasinghe, and Janak de Silva.

Upon concluding the proceedings, the judge bench decided to defer its verdict indefinitely.

Social activist Oshala Herath had put forward the appeals two weeks after the petition he had filed against the State Minister’s parliamentary seat and citizenship was dismissed by the Appeals Court.

Naming Gamage and several others as the respondents of his appeal, Herath said he had previously filed a petition alleging that the lawmaker is unqualified to hold the position of a member of parliament in Sri Lanka, as she also holds dual citizenship.

However, a three-member judge bench of the Appeals Court delivered a split decision on October 31, 2023 and dismissed the petition, subject to a fee.
