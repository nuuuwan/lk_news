Pathum Nissanka smashes Sri Lanka’s first-ever double century in ODI history

Sri Lanka’s top order batter Pathum Nissanka on Friday (Feb.09) stroked the maiden double-century hit by a Sri Lankan cricketer in ODI format.

Nissanka scored 210 off just 139 balls to register the first-ever individual double century for the Lions.

The 25-year-old will go down in the ODI history as the 12th player to hit a double-century in international cricket.

A short while ago, the star opener played a delightful knock against Afghanistan in the first ODI at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium.

Sri Lanka were 370/2 when Nissanka reached this historic milestone.

Meanwhile, Nissanka also broke the record 189 runs scored by Sanath Jayasuriya against India in Sharjah in 2000, which remained the highest ODI score amassed by a Sri Lankan for over 20 years.

This also re-writes the history as the highest number of runs scored by a Sri Lankan player at a home playground breaking the record.

The title to hold the highest score in the world’s ODI history is held by Rohit Sharma, who slammed 264 against Sri Lanka in 2014.
