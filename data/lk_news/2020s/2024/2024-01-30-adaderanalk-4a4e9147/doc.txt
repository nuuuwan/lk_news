Sajith visits Colombo National Hospital after SJB protest

Opposition Leader Sajth Premadasa was seen visiting the Colombo National Hospital this evening (30 Jan.), after two persons, including former MP Mujibur Rahman, were admitted during the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) protest.

Earlier today, an individual was admitted to the Accident Ward of the hospital after reportedly sustaining injuries when police had fired tear gas and water cannons in an attempt to disperse the SJB protesters.

Shortly after, it was reported that former MP Mujibur Rahman was rushed to the Emergency Unit of the Colombo National Hospital after falling ill during the protest march.

The SJB held a protest march against the conduct of the government, with the participation of Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa and other leaders and allies of the political party.
