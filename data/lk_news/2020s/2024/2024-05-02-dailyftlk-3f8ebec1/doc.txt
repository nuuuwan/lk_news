Driving the adoption of green energy practices across the country, Hayleys Solar, the renewable energy arm of Hayleys Fentons has entered into an agreement with the Bank of Ceylon (BOC) to provide low-interest loans for both residential and commercial customers in a bid to encourage them to make the transition to renewable energy.

Customers can take advantage of the partnerships’ exceptional financial schemes, which offer loan plans with the lowest interest rates in the market with a 7-year repayment period. The rates are as follows:

Residential Customers - 10% interest for up to Rs. 3 million

Commercial Customers -10% interest for the maximum loan amount up to Rs. 5 million, 11% interest for Rs. 5-10 million and 12.5% interest for Rs. 10 to 50 million

Even after paying the loan instalment, customers can save Rs. 45,000 upwards monthly with a 10kW system or exceed Rs. 75,000 with a 15kW system. For larger households and businesses, a 20kW system translates to monthly savings exceeding Rs. 100,000 after the loan payment. Larger capacity translates to larger savings over and above the loan instalment, which makes these financing options highly affordable.

Customers can enjoy substantial monthly savings based on their chosen system capacity. As explained in the table, as the system size grows, so do the savings:
