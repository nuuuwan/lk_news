Several vehicles seized under ‘Yukthiya’ operation ordered to be handed over to registered owners

The Kaduwela Magistrate’s Court has ordered that several vehicles, valued around Rs. 100 million and kept in the custody of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) after being impounded under the ongoing operation ‘Yukthiya’, be handed over to their registered owners.

Kaduwela Magistrate Chanima Wijebandara has issued this order while rejecting the CID’s request to further keep the relevant vehicles in custody for further investigations, Ada Derana reporter said.

The defense lawyer has also raised strong objections before the court stating that the CID had not obtained proper orders from the High Court to acquire the property in question.

In December 2023, the Kaduwela police had seized five luxury buses, a luxury car and a motorcycle owned by the sister of Malalage Sudath Kithsiri alias “Welivita Sudda”, who is said to be a drug trafficker, and handed them over to the CID.
