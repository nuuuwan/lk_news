Sri Lanka’s Hilton Colombo ready for private investment: state minister

ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka’s Hilton Colombo is ready for private sector investment, with four businessmen already expressing interest, State Minister for Urban Development and Housing Arundika Fernando said.

However, securing the expected financial investment for the project’s success is essential, Fernando told reporters on Wednesday March 06.

Meanwhile, progress on the Hyatt Hotel, which falls under Fernando’s ministry, has reached the halfway mark, with efforts underway to seek an investor for its completion, he said. There is also a proposal to attract investors for the development of both sides of D R Wijewardene Mawatha, stretching from Colombo Lotus Tower to the Lakehouse Roundabout.

A statement from the president’s media division (PMD) quoted the state minister as highlighting growing interest from India, China, and “several Western nations” in investing in the country.

“In response to the economic crisis that halted development projects last season, the government has taken action as the economy shows signs of improvement. Necessary development work is now underway to address the country’s pressing needs and stimulate growth.

“Plans have been set to commence a 2,000 houses project in Colombo and its suburbs, with support from Chinese aid. Additionally, initiatives are in place to issue deeds to all residents residing in flats, ensuring proper documentation and ownership rights,” Fernando was quoted as saying.

According to the state minister, progress has also been made on the “Kandukara Dashakaya” Development Project. Coastal development and low-lying land development activities have commenced as well, he said, as part of a series of regional-level development projects across the island.

The preliminary groundwork for the Japanese project aimed at cleaning the Beira Lake in Colombo has been successfully concluded. This sets the stage for the project to commence as early as next month, marking a significant step toward enhancing the environmental quality of the area, said Fernando.

“In response to the recurring issue of floods plaguing Colombo city, particularly during minor rainfall, our ministry has devised a comprehensive programme for flood control. Despite awaiting the necessary financial allocation, preparations for future initiatives are underway. Once funding is secured, our team is poised to swiftly implement measures to mitigate flooding and safeguard the city’s infrastructure.

“Notable interest from prominent nations such as India, China, and various Western countries underscores the growing confidence in investing in Sri Lanka. With the country’s economy showing signs of improvement, it’s inevitable that more investors will be drawn to opportunities here, bolstering economic growth and development efforts,” he said.
