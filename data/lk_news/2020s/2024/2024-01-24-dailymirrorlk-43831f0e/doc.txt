Jeevan Thondaman under fire for inviting South Indian actresses amidst austerity, hardship

Colombo, Jan -24 (Daily Mirror) - Ceylon Workers’ Congress (CWC) General Secretary Minister Jeevan Thondaman is in the centre of controversy over the presence of South Indian actresses Aishwarya Rajesh, Aishwarya Dutta, Samyuktha Menon, and Meenakshi (Pinky Sarkar) in national Thai Pongal celebrations conducted in Hatton last Sunday.

He is under fire from his political opponents who question him whether these South artistes were sponsored using tax payers’ money despite the government having declared austerity measures

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Organizer for Passara Letchumanar Sanjay asks why Mr. Thondaman took steps to celebrate the national Pongal festival in such a luxurious manner at a time when people are suffering due to the soaring cost of living.

He said, “Student dropouts have increased in the Nuwara-Eliya District and many families are suffering from hunger. People gave more than 100,000 votes and sent them to Parliament to get the services done for them. But, Mr. Jeevan Thondaman is bringing South Indian actresses. Where did money for the visit come from? Jeevan Thondaman, as a representative of the people, should definitely answer for wasting people's money in this manner,” he said.

He also said, instead of inviting South Indian actresses, local artistes could have been encouraged to attend.
