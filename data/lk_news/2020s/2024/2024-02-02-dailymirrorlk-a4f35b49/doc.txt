UN Human Rights office calls for amendment to Online Safety Act

Feb 02 -Â  The United Nations Human Rights office has urged the government to consider amending the controversial Online Safety Act to ensure it complies with human rights obligations.

The UN Human Rights said, "The new Online Safety Act will have far reaching negative implications for human rights, including freedom of expression," in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.

"We urge the Government to consider amending the law to address concerns of civil society and industry groups and ensure it complies with human rights obligations," the post also read.

The Act, which has been widely critized both locally and internationally, became law yesterday after it was endorsed by Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena.
