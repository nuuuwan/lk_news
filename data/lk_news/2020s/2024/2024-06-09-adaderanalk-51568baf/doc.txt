Indonesian woman found dead inside giant python

A woman was killed by a 5-meter (16-foot) python in central Indonesia after it swallowed her whole, local media reported Saturday.

The 45-year-old, from Kalempang village in South Sulawesi province, had told her husband on Thursday she was going to sell chilies to a collector.

When she failed to return, her husband and relatives initiated a search, village head Suardi Rosi told the Detik.com news website.

The next morning, a python was discovered near the woman’s abandoned belongings, the report said.

Along with some villagers, the husband of the woman — identified only as Farida — killed the snake and cut it open.

Earlier, her husband “found her belongings... which made him suspicious. The villagers then searched the area. They soon spotted a python with a large belly,” said Suardi.

“They agreed to cut open the python’s stomach. As soon as they did, Farida’s head was immediately visible.”

While such incidents are considered extremely rare, a number of people have died in Indonesia in recent years after being swallowed whole by pythons.

Last year, an 8-meter python was killed by residents in Southeast Sulawesi’s Tinanggea district after it was found strangling and eating one of the farmers in a village.

In 2018, a 54-year-old woman was found dead inside a 7-meter python in Southeast Sulawesi’s Muna town.

A farmer in West Sulawesi went missing a year earlier. He was found having been eaten alive by a 4-meter python at a palm oil plantation.
