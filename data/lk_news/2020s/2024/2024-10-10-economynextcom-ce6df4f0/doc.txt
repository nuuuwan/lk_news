Sri Lanka trade and banking groups team up to strengthen private sector financing

ECONOMYENXT – The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and the Sri Lanka Banks’ Association (SLBA) have signed a memorandum of understanding to promote sustainable finance and financial inclusion for the private sector.

“A key outcome aimed for through the MoU is to enable greater access for financing for Sri Lanka’s private sector, especially the export-oriented value chains and SME sector, to enable their sustainability transitions,” the chamber said in a statement.

Through this partnership the two organisations aim to engage in building both demand-side and supply-side capacity and connectivity on sustainable finance.

“With global trade, finance and investment regimes increasingly emphasising sustainability, Sri Lanka’s private sector and industry must rapidly transition and build capacity to remain competitive in international markets.”

SLBA has been supporting Sri Lanka’s green economy transition and financial inclusion with its voluntary Sustainable Banking Initiative (SBI) since 2015, the statement read.

“While building internal capacity within the banking sector, SBI has also engaged with other sector associations to promote innovative sustainable finance solutions.”

The Chamber and SLBA SBI, together with the Sustainable Development Council, embarked on a collaboration in 2023 to explore sustainable finance solutions.

“A key focus of this collaboration was to explore the establishment of a Blended Finance Facility that could attract private capital (both domestic and international) to address viability gaps in key sectors (such as agri-food) through risk sharing and structured finance solutions.”

The MoU will also support member companies with national and industry level engagement on their sustainability and climate strategies – on opportunities and risks (IFRS S1 and S2); in developing capacity to align financing needs and mobilisation in terms of Sri Lanka’s Green Finance Taxonomy.
