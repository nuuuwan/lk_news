ICC release ITT for media rights in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka

Feb. 5 (ICC) - The International Cricket Council will today release its Invitation To Tender (ITT) for media rights in three territories, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka for 2024 to 2025.

Following the successful conclusion of media rights agreements in several markets including India, the United Kingdom and Ireland, the USA and Canada, Sub-Saharan Africa region, Australia and Middle East and North Africa the ICC is now starting the process in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

In Pakistan there are two packages available combining both TV and digital rights including both men’s and women’s rights, with one TV and digital combined package available in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka respectively. The packages will be for three women’s events and three men’s events up until the end of next year.

ICC Chief Executive Geoff Allardice said: “We are delighted to be releasing the ITT for media rights in three of cricket’s major broadcast markets in South Asia, namely Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, as we continue to build our team of broadcast partners who will take ICC events to more fans across the world.”

The ITT will be released today, and interested parties need to email iccmediarights2024-2031@icc-cricket.com to access the tender documents. Subsequent ITTs for additional markets will be released in due course.
