Serendib Flour Mills launches fortified ‘Adhi Shakthi’ flour

Serendib Flour Mills, fuelled with the purpose of nourishing the nation, launched its new ‘Serendib Adhi Shakthi Fortified Wheat Flour’ – a micronutrient-fortified wheat flour exclusively aimed at plantation communities in Kandy recently.

Introduced in November last year, the new Serendib Adhi Shakthi flour contains essential nutrients such as Iron, Folic Acid, and Vitamin B12, and is tailored to meet the nutritional needs of estate communities, mainly to address key nutritional deficiencies and the rising incidence of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs).

Serendib Flour Mills working in collaboration with the Plantation Human Development Trust (PHDT), launched the product at the Golden Crown Hotel, Kandy amidst a distinguished presence of guests including PHDT Chairman Barath Arulsamy, Director General Lal Perera, and Kandy Regional Director Mahesh Wanigasuriya. Serendib Flour Mills’ top leadership, comprising CEO Vijay Sharma, CFO Suresh Murugesu, Director Brand and Corporate Communication Kalinga Wijesekara, and other team members were also present at the ceremony.

The colourful event included captivating dance performances and symbolised a significant step towards community enrichment and nourishment marking a key milestone in the region of Kandy.

With the introduction in Kandy, estates in surrounding areas such as Gampola, Matale, Nawalapitiya, and Pussellawa regions will have the opportunity of obtaining Serendib Adi Shakthi Fortified wheat flour, empowering communities with access to a vital source of nutrition and wellness.

The initiative is a testament to Serendib Flour Mills’ dedication to nourishing communities and fostering moments of celebration, demonstrating the company’s commitment to addressing health challenges and promoting wellbeing within the Sri Lankan estate community.
