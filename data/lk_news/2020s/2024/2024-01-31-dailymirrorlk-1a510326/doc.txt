Cinnamon Lakeside responds to allegations over contaminated soup

Colombo, Jan 31 (Daily Mirror) - In response to recent concerns surrounding an incident at Cinnamon Lakeside Colombo where a soup unfit for human consumption has reportedly been served to a patron, the establishment has clarified the incident.

In a statement, the management said the incident in question was clarified to be unrelated to a soup served at the restaurant but rather linked to a guest's use of white pepper in their soup, prompting immediate action.

“Cinnamon Lakeside Colombo has actively cooperated with the officials of the Ministry of Health and Public Health Inspectors (PHIs) during their investigations,” the hotel management said.

The establishment said it had conducted its own tests on the same batch of procured white pepper, finding no cause for concern.

“No other incidents of this nature have been reported from the restaurant visited by numerous guests on that day,” the statement stressed.

Despite these findings, Cinnamon Lakeside Colombo awaits the results of tests undertaken by the Ministry of Health.

The establishment remains steadfast in its commitment to stringent health and safety protocols, emphasizing that the safety of their approximately 1,000 daily guests remains a top priority.
