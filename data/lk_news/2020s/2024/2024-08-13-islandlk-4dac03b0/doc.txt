Bangladesh-SL FTA could help boost bilateral trade though uncertainties remain – Economist

A Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka could significantly enhance bilateral trade, although uncertainties remain, a Bangladeshi economic analyst said.

Speaking to The Island Financial Review economist Jamal Uddin said that both nations have substantial opportunities for economic collaboration, particularly in regional trade. Bangladesh currently imports more from Sri Lanka, but there is optimism among businessmen that the situation may improve under the new government led by Nobel laureate Dr. Muhammad Yunus.

Uddin added: ‘The recent political upheaval in Bangladesh, including the resignation of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, has impacted trade, but business leaders are hopeful that stability will return, enabling better trade relations.

‘The prospects of a FTA is especially appealing as it could lower tariffs and boost exports from Bangladesh to Sri Lanka, particularly in sectors like pharmaceuticals, paper and cement.

‘Bangladesh’s trade deficit with Sri Lanka has been growing, with Sri Lanka exporting more to Bangladesh than it imports. In the fiscal year 2022-23, Bangladesh’s trade deficit with Sri Lanka was USD 1.63 million, and this gap is expected to widen. Despite this, Bangladeshi exports to Sri Lanka have shown some growth, particularly in goods like medicines, ready-made garments and home textiles.

‘The FTA negotiations have been ongoing, with technical committees from both countries working on the details. If successful, the FTA would be Bangladesh’s first with any country, and it is expected to make regional trade more efficient by potentially reducing import-export times by 3 to 4 days if Sri Lankan ports are used.’

Meanwhile, a Sri Lankan businessman said: ‘Businessmen of Dhaka feel that everything is not normal yet. But they are optimistic that the situation will soon be under the control of the new government. Sri Lankans are doing well in the energy sector in Bangladesh and the recent political problem could be a storm in a tea cup.

‘Businessmen are optimistic that the new government will work to improve the business environment, especially since their eyes are on regionally focused. We urge the creation of an enabling business- friendly environment for boosting bilateral trade in this region.

‘In the case of Sri Lanka, Bangladesh depends on it for some goods and services. Recently, Bangladesh participated in a trade fair in Colombo and Bangladeshi businessmen are now looking to strengthen opportunities for trade development. Data found that both sides are eagerly waiting for a FTA that could increase business volumes.’

According to Abdul Awal Mintu, a former president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries (FBCCI), there is a good relationship between Dhaka and Colombo.

Mintu said the opening of LCs and import-export activities had been disrupted during the uprising. He believed that the situation will be normalized soon.

‘Statistics indicate that Bangladesh’s imports from Sri Lanka are increasing. However, the export of products to Bangladesh is also increasing from Sri Lanka. Overall, the bilateral trade gap is currently in favor of Sri Lanka, he explained.
