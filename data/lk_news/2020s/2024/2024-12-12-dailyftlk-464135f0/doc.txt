The groundwork for the 2025 Budget has commenced at the Ministry level, with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake leading the initial discussions.

These preliminary meetings, which began on Tuesday and continued yesterday, aim to outline expenditure priorities for the upcoming fiscal year.

On Tuesday, the discussions at the Presidential Secretariat focused on Budget proposals for the Ministries of Health, Mass Media, Agriculture, Livestock, Lands and Irrigation. Yesterday, attention turned to the Rural Development, Social Security and Community Empowerment Ministry as well as the Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation Ministry.

The discussions marked the start of a critical phase in the new administration’s fiscal planning as it seeks to address pressing national priorities whilst ensuring efficient resource allocation for 2015.
