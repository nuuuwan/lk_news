Nestlé promotes regenerative agricultural practices in the coconut value chain via Nestlé Coconut Development Plan

As part of the Nestlé Coconut Development Plan – the ‘Good Food Good Life’ company partnered with the Coconut Cultivation Board of Sri Lanka (CCB) to conduct a two-day training programme for coconut farmers. Conducted at CCB’s Coconut Development Training Center in Lunuwila, the programme was focused on educating coconut farmers on the implementation of regenerative agriculture practices in their farms, benefiting the farmers in improving coconut yield whilst conserving natural resources such as soil and water.

“Our long-running coconut development programme stands as a testament to our unwavering commitment to improve coconut cultivation in Sri Lanka. As the largest exporters of Coconut Milk Powder in the country, I am proud to be able to extend this initiative to support the farmers that supply coconut to us for our operations. Implementing regenerative agricultural practices in our coconut value chain is an active part of our efforts towards reaching net zero by 2050. Together with the CCB, this initiative is a significant step towards harnessing the full potential of this invaluable crop through the adoption of best practices, which are not only beneficial for coconut cultivation but also for the environment.” said Bernhard Stefan, Managing Director of Nestlé Lanka.
