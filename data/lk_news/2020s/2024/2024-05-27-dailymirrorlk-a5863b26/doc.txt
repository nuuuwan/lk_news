Hundreds of birds and fish dead in Anawilundawa sanctuary: Cause under investigation

Hundreds of birds and fish in the bird sanctuary in Anawilundawa Ramsar wetland and its watercourses have been dying for the last several days, much to the anxiety of the residents of the area and the environmentalists.

Residents of the area said flocks of migratory birds live and breed freely during this season in Anawilundawa Ramsar bird sanctuary, which is a tourist attraction.

They were of the opinion that chemical waste dumped haphazardly from a factory in the area resulted in the death of birds and fish in this manner.

Meanwhile, Range Forest Conservator W.L. Upananda said he referred specimens of the dead fish and birds to the Peradeniya Special Veterinary Unit for laboratory tests to determine the cause of death. He said the results of the laboratory tests were yet to be received.

However, officials of the Aqua Culture Development Authority said watercourses had been contaminated due to neglect of clearing algae, resulting in the death of fish and birds.
