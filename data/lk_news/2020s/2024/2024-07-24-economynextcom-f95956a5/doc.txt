Sri Lanka stocks pick up a bit, after policy rate cut

ECONOMYNEXT – The Colombo Stock Exchange closed up marginally on Wednesday, after the central bank’s policy rate announcement earlier in the day.

The broader All Share Index closed up 0.90 percent, or 104.45 points, at 11,701; while the more liquid S&P SL20 Index closed up 1.35 percent, or 45.40 points, at 3,414.

“Since there is an inverse relationship with the policy rate, the downward revision, or the downward trend in the rate made the ASPI more attractive,” Softlogic Stockbrokers said. “But it was still a low turnover day, trade volumes were low.”

Foreign activity was limited again with the day recording a net foreign outflow of 28 million rupees.

Foreign buying interest was seen in Three Acre Farms Plc (up at 306.00), Haycarb Plc (up at 79.50), and Tokyo Cement Company (Lanka) Plc non-voting (flat at 42.00).

Foreign selling was seen on Hatton National Bank Plc non-voting (up at 149.75), John Keells Holdings Plc (up at 193.25), and Bairaha Farms Plc (flat at 165.00).

The top contributors to the ASPI were Hatton National Bank Plc voting (up at 191.25), Richard Pieris and Company Plc (up at 19.80), and Commercial Bank of Ceylon Plc (up at 95.80). (Colombo/Jul24/2024)
