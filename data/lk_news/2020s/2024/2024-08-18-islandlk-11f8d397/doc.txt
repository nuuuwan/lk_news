During the first half of 2024, tea production registered a year-on-year decline mainly due to unfavourable dry weather conditions that prevailed in March and April 2024. However, with the subsequent improvement in weather conditions, production has recovered in the following months. Although rubber production had been steadily growing since beginning of 2024, a notable dip in production was observed in the latter part of the first half 2024 as a result of reduced tapping operations owing to heavy rainfall. Coconut production recorded a year-on-year growth in the first half of 2024 and showed a notable year-on-year increase in June 2024.
