Special security measures in place for Good Friday, Easter Sunday

(Colombo), March 26 (Daily Mirror) -Â  Special security measures have been implemented at churches across the country in view of the upcoming Good Friday and Easter Sunday, police said.

Police spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa said that Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon has directed all officers, including Senior Deputy Inspectors General of Police (SDIGs), DIGs, and officers in charge (OICs) of police divisions to ensure enhanced security.

He said Police OICs have been instructed to collaborate with priests and boards of trustees of churches to develop tailored security plans during Holy Masses from March 29 to 31.

Under this plan, church premises will be inspected discreetly before sermons begin, to avoid disturbing devotees. If necessary, body searches may be conducted after discussions with church authorities.

DIG Thalduwa said that instructions have been given to obtain the assistance of the Special Task Force (STF) and the Tri-Forces personnel if the number of police officers deployed to churches is inadequate.
