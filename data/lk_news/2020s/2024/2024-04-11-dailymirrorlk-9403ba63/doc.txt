Excise to launch special operation in Colombo City during Avurudu dry days

Colombo, April 11 (Daily Mirror) - The Department of Excise is planning to launch a special operation in Colombo during the two festive dry days targeting illegal booze sellers and to implement law strictly during the Sinhala and Tamil New Year period.

A senior Excise official overseeing the Colombo City told the Daily Mirror yesterday that a joint operation has been organised in collaboration with four main Excise stations in Kesbewa, Padukka, Battaramulla and Colombo City.

As a result over 50 officials deployed in several teams will be patrolling the Greater Colombo area in search of law breakers who would sell liquor defying Excise orders on April 12th and 13th.

The official said that they have received intelligence on organised vendors who would buy liquor in large stocks prior to the New Year period and then sell it at exorbitant rates in the black market. The surveillance teams will specially check for vehicles that are transporting liquor in large quantities for resale purpose.

The special operation will be conducted by Assistant Excise Commissioner Jayantha Silva of Colombo City on the instructions of Excise Commissioner General M.J. Gunasiri.

The perpetrators will be dealt under the provisions of the Excise Ordinance and if any licensed restaurant or bar found selling liquor during the banned period, their Excise license will be revoked.
