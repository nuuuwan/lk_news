Sri Lanka rupee quoted wide to US dollar as peg inconsistencies flare up

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s rupee opened wide at 301.50/302.50 to the US dollar Friday, as was quoted even wider at 301/303 to the dollar in early trade, dealers said, as dollar demand resumed following a 715 million dollar purchase of forex by the central bank in March.

Sri Lanka has a deeply flawed non-floating ad hoc soft-peg arrangement found in all defaulting IMF advised countries, with inconsistent policies where external and domestic anchors conflict, critics have pointed out.

In May 2023, after the central bank collected 666 million dollars amid panic sales by market participants when inconsistent peg was allowed to appreciate to 295 to the US dollar from 321 in April, the rupee came under pressure in the following two months.

As the inconsistencies of the deadly flexible exchange rate clash, the rupee is quoted wide, spot trading disappears, moral suasion comes in and the spot-next and one week trades becomes active.

Last year central bank then sold some dollars and also allowed the inconsistent peg to eventually fall to 329 eventually over the next few months.

When the currency appreciates in a short time, banks sell down their open positions, with some going negative.

Meanwhile importers also delay covering their bills as the rupee loses its usefulness as a denominator of future value, a basic attribute of a currency before ‘age of inflation’ central banking.

However, despite inconsistent exchange rate policy, monetary policy has been broadly deflationary on a net basis (despite the 700 million dollar purchase also injecting around 200 billion rupees in March) over many months.

The central bank has sold down its bill stock (domestic assets) and has bought dollars (built up net foreign asset) in classic pegging behaviour (strong side).

At the moment however the interbank money market is awash in rupees, when turned into credit by banks, regardless of how the liquidity was created.

A part of the the money is ‘printed’ by the central bank’s various liquidity tools, which creates demand for dollars,

Excess liquidity climbed to 155 billion rupees on April 18, and a 12.10 billion rupee overnight injection was made, despite the rupee weakening over the week.

Separately 107 billion rupees have been injected through term deals to date.

Analysts have urged the central bank not to encourage banks to trade without real deposits, using printed money, if the country wants to maintain external stability and avoid a second default but to have a penalty rate at least one percent higher than ceiling policy rate for its standing facility.

This time President Ranil Wickremesinghe also said the rupee will be brought down to 280 or 270 to the dollar, further firing uncertainty over exchange rate stability and encouraging importer hold offs.

There is however a somewhat ‘psychological’ 295 level that was reached in May 2023 among some market participants.

Various values can be attributed to the note issue of bad money central banks through mathematical or statistical models and completely rejecting economic principles explained by classical economists before ‘age of inflation’ central banking emerged from the 1920s.

The policy rate was suddenly invented by the Fed without political debate or parliament (Congressional) approval in the 1920s and the Great Depression followed within a decade.

“If President Wickremesinghe is serious about a strong rupee, he will have to bring a law like the Bank Charter Act as Prime Minister Robert Peel did to restrain the liquidity operations of the Bank of England and fix the exchange rate,” says EN’s economic columnist Bellwether.

“This can perhaps not be done as long as the IMF program is in force. The current monetary law which legitimizes printing money for growth also cannot be changed without offending the IMF.” (Colombo/Apr19/2024 – UPDATE II)
