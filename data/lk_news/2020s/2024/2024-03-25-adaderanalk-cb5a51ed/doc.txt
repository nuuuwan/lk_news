Kelaniya University students stage protest over death of student

A group of students at the Kelaniya University are staging a protest in front of the the university administrative building over the death of a student due to a sudden illness.

It is reported that a fourth year student of the Kelaniya University had passed away last night (24) after being hospitalised due to sudden illness.

However, the university students allege that the hospitalisation of the student in question was delayed due to the absence of an ambulance facility or other vehicle in the university premises to admit the concerned student to the hospital.

Accordingly, it is reported that around 150 students have launched a sit down protest in front of the university administrative building accusing that negligence by the university administration had led to the death of the student.
