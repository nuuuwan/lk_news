Extract fresh cucumber juice. You can do this by blending cucumber slices and then straining the juice through a fine sieve, or cheesecloth, to remove any pulp.

In a small bowl, mix together the aloe vera gel and cucumber juice until well combined.

Pierce the vitamin E capsules and squeeze out the oil into the mixture.

Add the olive oil to the mixture and stir well to ensure all ingredients are thoroughly combined.

Store the mixture in a clean, airtight container in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to chill.

After chilling, use a cotton pad, or your fingertips, to apply the mixture gently under your eyes.

Leave it on for about 15-20 minutes, then rinse off with lukewarm water and pat dry with a soft towel.
