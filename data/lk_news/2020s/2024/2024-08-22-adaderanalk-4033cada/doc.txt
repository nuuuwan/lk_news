SLPP defectors will soon have to rejoin party - Mahinda Rajapaksa

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa says that the members of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) who are now working separately, will have to come back to the party in the near future.

He claimed that certain individuals are working to support other parties during the election without supporting their own party, “for narrow political gains”.

Rajapaksa made these remarks while addressing the inaugural presidential election rally of the SLPP which was held in Anuradhapura.
