Sri Lanka ministry secretary to address BRICS leaders summit

ECONOMYNEXT – Secretary to Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs Aruni Wijewardane will address the upcoming BRICS Outreach and BRICS Plus Summit in Kazan, Russian Federation, on behalf of President Anura Dissanayake, the ministry said.

“She will also meet senior representatives from BRICS member countries to discuss Sri Lanka’s application to join BRICS as well as other issues of bilateral interest,” the MFA said.

Under the previous government, Sri Lanka initiated the process to join BRICS and its New Development Bank.

BRICS, which consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa recently expanded its membership to include Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates.

The forum is an important platform for cooperation among emerging markets and developing countries.

However, both Sri Lanka’s president and foreign minister have opted to sit out the significant networking opportunity provided by the internationally significant forum, opting instead for general election campaigning in the island nation.

“The President has written to his Russian counterpart conveying Sri Lanka’s interest in BRICS membership, while Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath has written to his counterparts in BRICS member countries seeking their support.”

Wijewardane is scheduled to address the upcoming Leaders’ Summit on behalf of Dissanayake.

There is also the issue of Sri Lankan citizens who have joined the Russian Armed Forces and remain unaccounted for. The ministry statement did not specify if this would be one of the topics up for discussion on the sidelines of the main event. (Colombo/Oct22/2024)
