Protests as Activists Accuse Former Health Minister of Pharma Fraud

Colombo (News 1st): Tension simmered outside the Ministry of Health this morning (16) as protesters gathered to denounce the alleged involvement of former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella in a pharmaceutical scandal.

The protest began with a symbolic play depicting the human cost of the purported misconduct, allegedly perpetrated under the shadow of a corrupt regime.

Civil society representatives, mass organization leaders, and social activists joined in the demonstration.

Their intention to march from the Ministry to the Cinnamon Gardens Police Station was abruptly halted by a police intervention.
