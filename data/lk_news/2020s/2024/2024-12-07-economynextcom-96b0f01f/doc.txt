Sri Lanka doctor cautions against skincare products containing steroids

ECONOMYNEXT – A Sri Lankan dermatologist has cautioned against using chemically heavy cosmetic products which could potentially create health issues.

“Methasone and Clobetasol added creams should not be applied on to the skin without a consultation with a doctor,” consultant dermatologist Dr Nayani Madurasinghe told reporters recently.

These were prescribed for short term use for certain skin conditions she said.

She pointed out that excessive usage of topical applications containing steroids of varying levels of strength could lower the skin’s immunity leading to various infections.

“High potency steroids shouldn’t be applied to the face or sensitive areas like armpits. But people are applying them as they want. This can damage the skin and attract fungal and bacterial diseases.”

Various products suspected to contain steroids were being sold across social media apps recommending them for reducing dark colour, or pigmentation, in three days, the doctor said.

These non-tested products cause more harm than good, including redness, stretch marks and pimples, she said, advising people to consult a doctor.

The cosmetic industry in Sri Lanka has been estimated to be worth an annual rupees 90 billion according  2022 industry data.
