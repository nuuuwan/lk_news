State Minister Balasuriya praises Indian PM Modi, emphasizes regional connectivity

State Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka, Tharaka Balasuriya, lauded Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, describing him as ‘charming’ and a ‘visionary.’ Balasuriya agreed with Modi’s assessment that increased connectivity between Sri Lanka, India, Myanmar, and Thailand would unlock more opportunities for the region.

He was in New Delhi to attend the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Foreign Minister’s Retreat.

Balasuriya highlighted the informal and candid nature of the BIMSTEC Foreign Minister’s Retreat. ‘It was very well organized, allowing us to share our ideas openly,’ he said to ANI.

Reflecting on his meeting with PM Modi, Balasuriya noted it was his first encounter with the Indian leader. ‘The Prime Minister is both charming and visionary. He pointed out that the European Union’s success was largely due to connectivity, something that South Asia and Southeast Asia lag behind in.

Therefore, we must focus on improving connectivity,’ Balasuriya added. He concurred with Modi’s view that enhanced connectivity would foster economic growth and trade across the Bay of Bengal region.

Discussing Sri Lanka’s approach to energy cooperation, trade, and transportation within BIMSTEC, Balasuriya stated that these areas are categorized under three verticals: energy security, food security, and people’s security. He highlighted initiatives like India’s e-visa application for medical tourism in BIMSTEC nations. ‘India’s advances in space technology, including BIMSTEC satellites and nanosatellites, also hold significant potential,’ he mentioned.

When asked about the need for more attention to sectors like tourism, trade, business, exports, and imports in Sri Lanka, Balasuriya affirmed this need. ‘We are focusing on enhanced connectivity with India. For example, Prime Minister Modi mentioned that developing wind power in northeast and northwest Sri Lanka could create new revenue streams,’ Balasuriya said.
