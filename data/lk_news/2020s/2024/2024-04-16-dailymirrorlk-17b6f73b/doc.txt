Keheliyaâ€™s official vehicles not handed over yet?

Colombo, April 16 (Daily Mirror) - Since the remanding of former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, the two official vehicles provided to him while he was Minister are still being used by his family members, a Health Ministry official alleged.

He claimed that the official residence provided to the former Minister at Wijerama Mawatha has also not been handed over yet.

If a public official is in remand custody, all the privileges he has received will be revoked immediately. Hence, the official questioned why former Minister Rambukwella is being given special consideration.

The official also alleged that the family members of Minister Rambukwella, who is on remand, come to the Welikada Prison in the same official vehicles.

A Toyota Prado and a Mercedes-type vehicle are being used by his family members to visit him.

The official disclosed that more than 600 vehicles were missing, and it is suspicious that these vehicles could still be being used by the family members of former Health Ministers.
