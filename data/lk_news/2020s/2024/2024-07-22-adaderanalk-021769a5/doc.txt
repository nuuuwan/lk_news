Colombo HC orders release of Ven. Gnanasara Thero on bail

The Colombo High Court has ordered Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thero to be released on bail, as per a recent order issued by the Court of Appeal.

This order was issued by Colombo High Court judge Adithya Patabendige this morning (22), Ada Derana reporter said.

On July 18, 2024, the Court of Appeal granted bail for Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thero, who had been sentenced to four years of rigorous imprisonment for making defamatory comments on Islam at Kuragala, until the hearing of the revision petition filed by him.

Accordingly, the Thero was ordered to be released on a monetary bail of Rs 50,000 and two surety bail of Rs 500,000 each. Additionally, the Appeals Court imposed an overseas travel ban on Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thero and ordered the Colombo High Court to communicate that to the Immigration and Emigration Controller.

On March 28, 2024, the Colombo High Court sentenced Gnanasara Thero to four years of rigorous imprisonment while imposing a fine of Rs. 100,000, over the defamatory comments made against Islam during a 2016 media briefing convened on the Kuragala Buddhist monastery, causing damage to national and religious harmony.

The judge found the monk guilty of the two indictments filed by the Attorney General under the Penal Code. Accordingly, the accused was sentenced to two years of rigorous imprisonment for each indictment and was imposed two fines of Rs. 50,000 each. He also ordered that the two sentences be served separately.

Gnanasara Thero’s prison sentence was also ordered to be extended by two more years in the event of his failure to pay the fine.

However, the judge, delivering the verdict, ruled that the allegations levelled against Gnanasara Thero by the prosecution have been proved beyond reasonable doubt, adding it became evident during the trial that the statement in question was not ‘accidental’ but ‘deliberate’.

Pointing out that such statements disrupts the religious harmony and unity in the country, the judge emphasized that the accused failed to fulfil his responsibility as a religious leader who is entrusted with maintaining the inter-faith harmony.

Further, the judge informed Gnanasara Thero while delivering the verdict that he is allowed to appeal the verdict.
