Sri Lankan Ambassador to Saudi Arabia initiates felicitation of long-serving migrant workers

Sri Lankan Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Ameer Ajwad has initiated a tradition of recognising and felicitating long-serving Sri Lankan migrant workers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Chandralal Senadhira, who has served as a senior manager at the Saudi Almarai multinational dairy company for more than 30 years and is leaving Saudi Arabia for good, was felicitated and presented a memento by Ambassador Ajwad during a brief event hosted by the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Riyadh.

Speaking at the occasion, Ambassador Ajwad stated that Sri Lankan migrant workers form part of the bilateral relations between Sri Lanka and Saudi Arabia and that they make significant contributions in different fields to the development of the host country as well as to the economy of the home country by sending remittances. The Embassy has initiated this tradition to recognise their constructive contributions to the relations between the two countries.

Ambassador Ajwad also took the opportunity to extend his sincere appreciation and gratitude to the management of the Saudi Almarai company, which has employed more than 7,000 Sri Lankan migrant workers, for the unwavering trust and confidence that the company has placed in Sri Lankan manpower.

During the event held at the Sri Lanka Embassy premises in Riyadh, Consular Affairs Minister Counsellor Dulmith Waruna, Employment and Labour Welfare Outgoing Counsellor H.W. Samantha, and the newly appointed Employment and Labour Welfare Counsellor Mangala Randeniya, as well as Senior Manager Khaleel Rahman, and other senior officials of the Saudi Almarai company participated.
