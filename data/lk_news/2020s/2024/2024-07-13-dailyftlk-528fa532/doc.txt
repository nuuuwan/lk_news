Seylan Bank partners with The Wedding Show 2024 as official banking partner

Seylan Bank has partnered with The Wedding Show 2024, the country’s largest wedding related show, as the event’s official banking partner.

The event is a unique opportunity for hotels, event management and photography groups, designers, and beauticians to come together and share ideas. Set to open its doors on 12 July at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Convention Centre from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., The Wedding Show will host approximately 150 trade stalls across three days.

It is expected that nearly 15,000 couples and families will patronise the show, allowing them to sample the services they might most desire to celebrate important life events. Visitors can experience the best of what Sri Lanka’s wedding industry has to offer. Visitors planning weddings and events may confer with leading photo and videographers alongside leading bridal/grooming tailors. They may explore hoteliers, beauty salons, and event managers.

Seylan Bank Assistant General Manager – Marketing and Sales Asiri Abhayaratne said: “We are keen on this partnership with The Wedding Show. It allows us to bring our clients closer to celebrating the important moments in life. We are also keen to offer our clients a wide array of value additions to help them prepare to celebrate a lifelong commitment. To this effect, our Mega Rewards loyalty program offers customers the opportunity to create unforgettable moments, without worrying about finances.”

Seylan will offer a range of banking products with a special focus on Mega Rewards, a cash grant on weddings, births, and anniversaries. As a cash reward based on a customer’s account balance, Seylan Mega Rewards stands as the only scheme on the market to offer definitive rewards. It allows Seylan’s clients to celebrate the most personal and fulfilling milestones in their lives.

Seylan Bank offers personal loans and credit cards with eligibility criteria for emergency cash needs, including events as extensive as weddings.
