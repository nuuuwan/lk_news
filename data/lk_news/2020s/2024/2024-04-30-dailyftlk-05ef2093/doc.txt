State Minister for Defence urges immediate action on potential landslide threat near Ella-Wellawaya road

State Minister for Defence Pramitha Bandara Thennakoon has directed the attention to a pre-symptom condition of a potential landslide near the Ella-Wellawaya road in the Karandagolla area of the Badulla district.

The move was in response to recent indications of landslip susceptibility in Malittagolla, a sloping region of around two acres in the Ella area of Karandagolla. Concerns have been expressed by the community residing in the area, who blames the condition on possible effects from the Uma Oya project. Urging immediate action, he has instructed the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) and Disaster Management authorities to inspect the site and provide a comprehensive report.

In response to the directive, an expert team comprising the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) Director-General, NBRO Director and a team of scientists will conduct an on-site inspection to assess ground instability in the area.Â  The objective is to analyse the situation thoroughly and propose necessary recommendations to mitigate potential risks and damages.

The State Minister for Defence has instructed officials from the NBRO and DMC to take immediate measures to prevent possible damages and ensure the safety of the surrounding area.
