Japan and UN Women unite to advance women, peace and security agenda in Sri Lanka

The Government of Japan and UN Women launched the project “Pathways to Peace” aimed at strengthening women’s economic empowerment and their leadership in peacebuilding and conflict prevention in Sri Lanka.

It aims to support the implementation of the National Action Plan (NAP) on Women, Peace and Security (WPS) which the Government of Japan has been assisting Sri Lanka with since 2018 as its partner country.

In February 2023, Sri Lanka adopted its first NAP on WPS, in keeping with its international obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000). The development of this Plan was led by Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Women, Child Affairs, and Social Empowerment, with technical support from UN Women and with funding from the Government of Japan.

Building on the successful adoption of the Plan, the project aims to create stronger pathways to peace by implementing its priority areas. This includes providing capacity building support to 500 women peacebuilders, enabling them to lead dispute resolution, mediation and peacebuilding, along with social norms and behaviour change programmes at the household and community levels to promote gender equality and social harmony.

The project will also support 500 women-led micro enterprises in former conflict affected areas and provide support to vulnerable groups including women heads of households and women with disabilities who have been impacted by the country’s socio-economic crisis.

UN Women Sri Lanka Head of Office Ramaaya Salgado said: “Japan has been a longstanding partner of UN Women in advancing the women, peace and security agenda in Sri Lanka. Our programmes have led to meaningful change in the lives of women, and we look forward to continuing this partnership to empower Sri Lankan women to become leaders of change.”

The project will be implemented in the districts of Anuradhapura, Batticaloa, Mannar and Mullaitivu.
