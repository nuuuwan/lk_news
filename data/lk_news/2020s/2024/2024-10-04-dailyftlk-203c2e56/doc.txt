Sajith calls for national unity; urges focus on solutions over politics

Urges all political factions to set aside narrow political arguments and prioritise welfare of SL

Criticises prevailing hypocritical political culture and calls for a collective effort to find practical solutions

Urges need to support local entrepreneurs and businesses, promote investments, and create export-oriented economic growth that generates jobs for youth

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leader Sajith Premadasa has emphasised the need for national unity and collaborative efforts to tackle Sri Lanka’s pressing issues during a recent meeting with party workers in the Dehiwala area. He urged all political factions to set aside narrow political arguments and prioritise the welfare of the country.

In his address, Premadasa acknowledged the difficult circumstances faced by the populace, stating, “Today, the people of the country have fallen into a difficult situation. Full strength and support must be given to the rebuilding of these people and this country.” He criticised the prevailing “hypocritical political culture” and called for a collective effort to find practical solutions to the nation’s challenges.

Premadasa stressed the importance of focusing on national interests, stating, “At this moment, narrow political debates should be put aside, and solutions should be sought.” He noted that while differing opinions can lead to healthy discussions, they often hinder the resolution of pressing issues. He pointed out the slow economic growth, which has restricted access to money for the public, hampered circulation, and negatively impacted production processes.

The SJB leader called for a transformative approach to politics, advocating for new thinking to reclaim the motherland. He remarked, “Not an economic contraction, there should be growth; the era of enriching the hands of 22 million people should be brought about.”

Premadasa urged the need to support local entrepreneurs and businesses, promote investments, and create export-oriented economic growth that generates jobs for the youth. He emphasised that rebuilding the country requires moving beyond traditional political systems to provide genuine solutions to the people’s problems.

As the country approaches its next general election, Premadasa’s call for unity and collaboration resonates, as a crucial message for addressing the myriad challenges faced by Sri Lankans today.
