Sri Lanka addresses urgent need for gender-responsive climate policies

Colombo, March 26 (Daily Mirror) -  The Policy Dialogue on 'Sri Lankan Women and Girls in Climate Action' held on March 26th at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) in Colombo brought together key stakeholders to address the pressing need for gender-responsive climate policies in Sri Lanka.

Organized by the Ministry of Environment in collaboration with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and SLYCAN Trust, the policy dialogue aimed to explore avenues for enhancing gender-inclusive climate action.

The dialogue shed light on the disproportionate impact of climate change on women and girls, emphasizing the urgent need for comprehensive and gender-responsive climate policies. Sri Lanka, ranked 30th among 180 countries affected by climate change, faces rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events, exacerbating vulnerabilities and deepening inequalities within communities.

In his opening remarks, Mr. Kunle Adeniyi, Representative of UNFPA Sri Lanka, highlighted the vital role of women and girls in climate adaptation and mitigation efforts. He emphasized that empowering women and girls is not only a moral imperative but also a strategic necessity for sustainable development. Mr. Adeniyi outlined initiatives focusing on ensuring access to sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), ending gender-based violence (GBV), and dismantling harmful practices to build resilience in the face of climate change.

Azusa Kubota, Resident Representative of UNDP in Sri Lanka, stressed the importance of integrating gender perspectives into national climate policies. She emphasized the need for collaboration to address the vulnerabilities faced by women, particularly in households headed by women, who are more likely to be affected by climate-induced events.

The highlight of the policy dialogue was a panel discussion on gender-responsive climate action featuring key experts in the field. The panel, moderated by Kunle Adeniyi, delved into challenges, opportunities, and best practices associated with integrating gender perspectives into climate policies, particularly concerning women’s health.

The policy dialogue also featured an exhibition showcasing best practices, innovations, and community-led actions in gender-inclusive climate action. Participants emphasized the need for collaborative efforts among government, civil society, the private sector, and international organizations to address the gender dimensions of climate change effectively.

As the dialogue concluded, stakeholders expressed their renewed commitment to advancing gender-responsive climate policies and action, recognizing the imperative of placing women and girls at the center of climate action for a sustainable and equitable future. The event marked a significant step towards fostering inclusive and effective strategies to tackle the challenges of climate change in Sri Lanka.
