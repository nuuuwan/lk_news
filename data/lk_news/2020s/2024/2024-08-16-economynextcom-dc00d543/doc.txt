Sri Lanka’s ComBank raises Rs22.54bn in largest rights issue

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Commercial Bank of Ceylon Plc has raised 22.54 billion rupees to increase its Tier I and total capital to facilitate future business growth.

The Bank offered ordinary voting and non-voting shareholders an issue of one equivalent share for every five shares held, at 85 rupees an ordinary voting share and 69 rupees an ordinary non-voting share.

It received applications for 266,079,848 ordinary voting shares valued at 22.616 billion rupees, and 17,346,959 ordinary non-voting shares to the value of 1.196 billion rupees at the conclusion of the rights issue.

“Our ability to raise such a significant amount in capital at a time of economic challenge truly underlines Commercial Bank’s status as a systemically-important bank,” Commercial Bank Chairman Mr Sharhan Muhseen said.

This was the largest rights issue to date by a bank in the country, the bank said in a statement.

“This capital infusion will fuel a new spurt of growth that will support economic recovery in Sri Lanka and stimulate investor interest in the opportunities offered by the Bank,” Commercial Bank Managing Director/CEO Sanath Manatunge said.

The funds are to be used to finance expansion by increasing the lending portfolio of the Bank, including sustainable finance and lending to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), he said.

The rights issue came a month after the Bank raised 20 billion rupees through a debenture issue. (Colombo/Aug16/2024)
