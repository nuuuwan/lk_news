London…here I come

Versatile musician Hiruni Virginia Fernando is due to leave for London, today, to team up with her husband.

Of course, the local music scene would very much miss this highly talented artiste who has impressed many with her booming bass sounds.

A Trinity College London registered teacher, she did the needful, as music teacher, at Good Shepherd Convent Kotahena, Colombo 13, and at St. Lawrence’s Convent Wellawatte, Colombo 6.

She also played bass for C&C with Chandani Hettiarachchi and was seen in action, as a pianist, at the Galadari Hotel, in Colombo.

Hiruni says she will be busy with her music, in London, as well, but in a different format.

Her teaching skills will surface, once again, as she will be conducting leisure playing and exam-based online and physical classes, connected with the piano and guitar (bass, electric and classical guitar).

According to Hiruni, she will be operating from East Croydon, in London.
