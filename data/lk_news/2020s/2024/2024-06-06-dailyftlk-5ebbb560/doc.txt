AHK champions first-ever Sri Lankan delegation at Drupa 2024

The Delegation of German Industry and Commerce in Sri Lanka (AHK Sri Lanka) proudly facilitated the first-ever Sri Lankan delegation’s participation at Drupa 2024, the world’s largest trade fair for the printing industry and technology.

Held after an eight-year hiatus, Drupa 2024 was a landmark event, marking significant advancements and opportunities in the global printing industry.

AHK Sri Lanka played a pivotal role in organising and supporting the delegation, which comprised 17 members from the Sri Lanka Association for Printers (SLAP), representing eight companies from the commercial, newspaper, stationery printing, and packaging industries. This pioneering effort by AHK Sri Lanka not only showcased the diverse capabilities of Sri Lanka’s printing sector but also facilitated vital bilateral discussions with key stakeholders from the German printing industry.

The Sri Lankan Ambassador to Germany Varuni Muthukumarana headed several strategic meetings organised by AHK Sri Lanka. These meetings, joined by SLAP President Anil Kariyawasam and its members, focused on enhancing cooperation, knowledge transfer, and investment opportunities between Sri Lanka and Germany.

“Participating in Drupa 2024 marks a significant milestone for Sri Lanka’s printing industry,” stated Varuni Muthukumarana. “Our engagements here have laid the foundation for future collaborations that will help the print industry meet international standards and foster economic growth.”

Multiple successful meetings were held with the German Print and Paper Technology Association regarding conducting awareness programmes on current and potential EU regulations to help the Sri Lankan printing industry stay competitive. The Association of the German Paint and Printing Ink Industry e.V. committed to organising a virtual fact-finding mission to Sri Lanka to explore business and investment opportunities. VDM Nord-West explored possibilities for training and education, and Heidelberg provided the delegation with a guided tour of the latest print machinery.

Anil Kariyawasam stated, “The delegation organised by AHK Sri Lanka to Drupa 2024 significantly benefitted the printing industry in Sri Lanka. It equipped our industry professionals with crucial insights into current and upcoming EU regulations, helping them remain compliant and competitive in the global market, which in turn will bolster the Sri Lankan economy.”

One of the participants, Angela from Richard Trading Co. Ltd., thanked AHK Sri Lanka for organising the trip to the exhibition, noting that it helped the company understand and learn international standards and the latest printing technology, which would significantly boost their operations.

Thushara from Liberty Publishers stated, “By attending Drupa 2024, we created multiple connections with experts in the industry. We had difficulty acquiring spare components for our equipment; however, the exhibition assisted us in locating the necessary items.”
