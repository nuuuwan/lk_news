School teachers and principals report ‘sick’

The Ceylon Teachers’ Union (CTU) says that school teachers and principals are engaged in an islandwide trade union action by reporting sick leave today (26).

CTU General Secretary Joseph Stalin stated that teachers and principals would be brought to Colombo for a protest.

Meanwhile, it is reported that certain teachers have also advised students from many schools not to attend school today due to the strike action.

The trade union, which coincides with the start of the second school term, has disrupted educational activities at schools across the country.

Meanwhile, the president of the Joint Committee of Government Executive Officers, says that they would continue their trade union action by participating in the ‘sick leave’ campaign today (26) for the second consecutive day, as their demands have not been adequately addressed.
