Investigations after report from Tirukkovil education zone

Colombo, March 13 (Daily Mirror) - The Education Ministry is to launch an investigation after receiving the report from the Tirukkovil Education Zone regarding the death of the 16-year-old schoolboy in Ampara after collapsing while participating in a marathon race.

The marathon race was held at the Tirukkovil Methodist Central College on Monday morning as part of the inter-house sports meet at the school premises.

The student was admitted to the Tirukkovil Hospital and later transferred to the Akkaraipattu Hospital for further treatment, where he was pronounced dead.

Following the incident, a tense situation was reported after a group of school students and residents protested by blocking the road in front of the hospital, alleging that the sick student was not treated.

Later, the Police and the Special Task Force (STF) were deployed to diffuse the situation after it turned violent, with some protestors pelting stones at the hospital.

Earlier, a circular had been issued by the Education Ministry not to conduct outdoor activities due to soaring atmospheric temperatures.

Following the directive, schools are instructed to refrain from conducting any sports events, practices, or other outdoor activities during this period to ensure the well-being and safety of students.
