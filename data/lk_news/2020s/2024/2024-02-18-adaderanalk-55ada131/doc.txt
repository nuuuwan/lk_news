Showers expected at a few places in two provinces

The Department of Meteorology says showers or thundershowers may occur at a few places in Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces after 4.00 p.m.

Fairly strong winds about 30-40 kmph can be expected at times in eastern slopes of the central hills and in Northern, North-central, North-western, Uva and Eastern provinces and in Hambantota and Kandy districts.

The public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
