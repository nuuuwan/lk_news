President reveals rapid development plans for overlooked Mahaweli ‘A’ and ‘B’ zones

President Ranil Wickremesinghe has unveiled immediate plans to swiftly develop the Mahaweli A and B zones, previously overlooked by the Mahaweli project, as part of the nation’s transition towards a modern agricultural economy.

Further, he emphasized that this initiative would bring significant benefits to the people residing in these areas, the President’s Media Division (PMD) said.

Without the pioneering efforts of the late Mr. Gamini Dissanayake in implementing the Mahaweli project, which revolutionized irrigation practices in the country, Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka would not have achieved self-sufficiency in rice production nor would it have met its electricity demands.

The Head of State made this statement while participating in the ceremony commemorating late Minister Gamini Dissanayake’s 82nd birth anniversary on Wednesday afternoon (March 20).

The ceremony took place in front of the Gamini Dissanayake statue at Ananda Kumaraswamy Mawatha in Colombo.

Reflecting on the memories of Mr. Dissanayake, the President emphasized that his dedication serves as an exemplary model for all.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe honoured Mr. Dissanayake by laying floral tributes at his statue. The commemoration celebrations commenced with religious ceremonies and a minute of silence was observed to honour the memory of all the heroes who sacrificed their lives for the nation, including those who perished in the Totalaga tragedy on October 23, 1994, alongside Mr. Dissanayake, other national leaders, and the Attorney-at-law late Mrs. Srima Dissanayake, founder of the Gamini Dissanayake Foundation.

The welcome address for the ceremony was delivered by MP Mayantha Dissanayake, who serves as the Vice President of the Gamini Dissanayake Foundation.

Former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, while sharing his thoughts, described Gamini Dissanayake’s character as a political precedent, emphasizing his popularity and service to the people. Mr. Jayasuriya highlighted Dissanayake’s effective leadership, attributing Sri Lanka’s rapid development to his astute management.

Chairman of the Gamini Dissanayake Foundation, Governor of the Sabaragamuwa Province Mr. Navin Dissanayake, reflected on his father’s legacy as a former leader of the United National Party. He emphasized Gamini Dissanayake’s belief in the party’s economic system as suitable for the country. Navin Dissanayake expressed hope for a future moderate right-wing movement and voiced his desire for such a leader to be elected by the people in the upcoming presidential election.
