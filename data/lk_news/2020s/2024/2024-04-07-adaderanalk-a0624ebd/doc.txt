Govt expedites free rice distribution to low-income families

The Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government has informed all District Secretaries to accelerate the free distribution of rice for low-income families.

The Cabinet of Ministers recently granted approval to a proposal of President Ranil Wickremesinghe to provide 20 kg of rice per family for two months to low-income families.

Accordingly, the ministry has notified that the distribution of rice bags to the selected beneficiary families will be carried out at the Divisional Secretariat level.

These rice bags will be distributed to the ‘Aswesuma’ beneficiaries, individuals selected by the Welfare Benefits Board from among those who have submitted appeals for the welfare program, Samurdhi beneficiaries who were not eligible for ‘Aswesuma’ benefits, elderly people who are not receiving welfare or Samrudhi benefits but additional financial assistance, disabled persons and chronically ill persons.

Meanwhile, the District secretaries should carry out the purchase of the required 54,800 metric tons of rice from the suppliers and the treasury has reportedly arranged the necessary provisions for the purpose.
