Support for Justice Ministry’s virtual courts initiative

US Ambassador Julie Chung this week joined the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Justice, Prisons Affairs and Constitutional Reforms Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe in a significant step forward for MOJ’s virtual courts in Sri Lanka.

A donation of 35 video conferencing units and opening new facilities in Agunakolapalessa and Galle will help ensure virtual proceedings improve prisoners’ access to legal services, speed up trials, and reduce the judicial backlog.

Ambassador Chung said the United States is committed to supporting Sri Lanka’s initiatives that aim to reduce prison overcrowding, streamline court automation, and enhance the overall effectiveness of judicial processes.
