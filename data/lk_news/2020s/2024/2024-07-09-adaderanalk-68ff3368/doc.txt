Bail rejected for CCD Inspector and Constable arrested over bribe

The Colombo Magistrate’s Court rejected the bail application of the Police Inspector and the Constable attached to the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD), who were arrested by officers of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), while accepting a bribe of over Rs. 150,000.

Colombo Chief Magistrate Thilina Gamage also ordered the suspects to be remanded in custody until July 23, when the relevant bail application was taken up today (09).

During today’s proceedings, the CIABOC officers presented the cash which was accepted by the two suspected police officers at the time of their arrest.

On Friday (05), the Bribery Commission apprehended the two suspects inside the CCD premises in Dematagoda. They had solicited a sum of Rs. 450,000 as a bribe and were apprehended while accepting the final payment of over Rs. 150,000 out of that.

A resident of the Ibbagamuwa area of Kurunegala had lodged a complaint with the CCD in relation to a fraudulent money transfer through an online business of exchanging the electronic currency called ‘USDT’.

The two suspected cops had allegedly stated to the complainant that two suspects connected to the incident were arrested and produced before the court. However, they have demanded a bribe of Rs. 454,200 to refrain from arresting the complainant as well.

The individual in question has initially provided an amount of Rs. 300,000 to the two cops as the first payment of the bribe, the CIABOC said, adding that the duo were arrested while obtaining the remaining Rs. 154,200.
