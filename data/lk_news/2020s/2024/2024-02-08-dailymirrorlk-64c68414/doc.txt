Ranil has brainwashed NPP: Nimal Siripala

Colombo, Feb 8 (Daily Mirror) - President Ranil Wickremesinghe had brainwashed National People’s Power (NPP) and that is why its leader went before Indian leaders, Ports, Shipping, and Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said in Parliament today.

"Those who held lectures, on Indian expansionism have gone to meet Indian leaders today,” he quipped.

“They who wore worn-out clothes are wearing full suits. We are happy about this move. This is because Ranil Wickremesinghe has brainwashed them," MP De Silva said.

"We can recall how these leaders criticized the government for going into business ventures with Adani group," he added.

He also said that around 200,000 tourists had visited Sri Lanka during the last month.
