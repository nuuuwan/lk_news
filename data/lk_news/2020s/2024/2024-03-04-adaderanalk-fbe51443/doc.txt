Two former police officers sentenced to death over custodial death

The Colombo High Court has sentenced to death two former police officers who were attached to Peliyagoda Police, after they were found guilty of assaulting to death a suspect while in custody at the Peliyagoda police station in 2005.

Colombo High Court Judge Navaratne Marasinghe delivered the verdict today (04) following a trial that lasted over 18 years.

In July 2005, a person who was working in the residence of a police officer attached to the police fingerprint division had been handed over to Peliyagoda Police Station on suspicion of allegedly stealing a mobile phone from the house in question.

Accordingly, a Sub-Inspector of Police and a Police Constable attached to Peliyagoda Police Station were convicted of unlawfully detaining the 52-year-old suspect and brutally assaulting him to death.

Furthermore, the two accused were also ordered to pay a compensation of Rs. 1 million each to the daughter of the victim.

Meanwhile, the Colombo High Court also ordered the acquittal of the second and third defendants of the case.
