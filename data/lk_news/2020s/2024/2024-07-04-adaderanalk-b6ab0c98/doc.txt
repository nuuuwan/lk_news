Custom officers launch ‘sick leave’ trade union action

The Customs Officers’ Union says they have decided to engage in trade union action by reporting ‘sick leave’ today (4) and tomorrow (5), in protest over the lack of a satisfactory response to their demands from the authorities.

A member of the union’s executive committee, Tharaka Kumarasinghe stated that the union’s members are engaging in this trade union action to protest against the authorities’ arbitrary decision to introduce the Sri Lanka Revenue Authority (SLRA) Bill and make amendments to various sections of the Customs Ordinance.

He added that customs officials have been engaging in a “work-to-rule” trade union action for the past two days because discussions with authorities on several occasions did not provide any necessary solutions to their demands.

Therefore, Kumarasinghe further stated that as they did not receive necessary responses over their demands, the Customs Officers’ Union decided to engage in trade union action by reporting ‘sick’ for two days.

However, Minister Bandula Gunawardena says that engaging in strike actions at this moment cannot be approved under any circumstances.
