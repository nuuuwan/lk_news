Customs Officers resort to work-to-rule action

Colombo, March 18 (Daily Mirror) -Â  The Customs Officers have decided to resort to a 'work to rule,' action commencing this morning.

This action comes as a direct response to grievances surrounding the transfer of the account responsible for disbursing overtime pay, incentives, and rewards.

The dispute stems from the decision to shift control of the account from the Director General of Customs to the Ministry of Finance. Under the previous arrangement, payments were managed through the People's Bank, a process now subject to disruptions and delays following the transfer.
