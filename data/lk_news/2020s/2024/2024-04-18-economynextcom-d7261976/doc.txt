Sri Lanka firms expected to start gender equality panels in planned law

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s state agencies and private companies will be required to set up a gender equality panel, headed by a senior executive according to a draft law published in the government gazette.

The panel called a Gender Focal Point should be headed by an Additional Secretary or a deputy to the head of the institution or higher, the bill says.

The Gender Equality Council staffed by the Inspector General of Police or his representative and secretaries to the ministers of justice, education, youth affairs and women will also be created

The Gender Focal Point would have to prepare a plan of activities on gender-equality and report directly to the council, while being responsible for promoting gender balance in decision making processes and implementing programs based on gender equality.

Currently, Sri Lanka’s Employment of Women, Young Person and Children Act contains provisions such as section 2A(2)(g) which prohibits women from working at night for more than ten days. (Colombo/Apr18/2024)
