Bangladesh PM Hasina resigns, flees to India after deadly protests: Media reports

ECONOMYNEXT – Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has resigned and fled the country on Monday after weeks of deadly protests that saw over 300 being killed, foreign media reported.

Sky News, citing a leading national paper in Bangladesh, said Hasina and her sister took a military helicopter to India.

Reuters reported: “They are taking “safe shelter” away from her official residence”.

Over 90 people were killed in clashes over the weekend in Bangladesh as protests initially triggered by students, spread across the country after forex shortages and depreciation.

The demonstrations began with students seeking to end a quota system for government jobs, but clashes with police and pro-government activists escalated into violence that left more than 200 dead last month.

Bangladesh protesters gave the government 48 hours to meet a new set of demands including accountability from the government, which have grown into calls for Hasina, who has been leading the country since 2009, to step down.

Sri Lanka’s former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa also resigned and fled the country in a similar way in 2022 after mass protests demanded his resignation following his wrong economic policies led to an unprecedented economic crisis.
