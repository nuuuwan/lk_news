Sri Lanka Kandyan king palace renovated by US cultural preservation fund

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Kandyan Kings’ Palace and Archaeology Museum located within the Temple of the Tooth Relic complex was restored with a 265,000 dollar (77 million rupee) grant from the US Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP).

It was a joint project by the US Embassy in Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Culture and Department of Archaeology.

Initiated in 2021, the project was carried out in two phases. During the first phase, efforts were focused on conserving the historic infrastructure of the Kings’ Palace and improving accessibility for visitors with disabilities.

The second phase upgraded the Archeology Museum’s displays and facilities, creating a more engaging and educational experience for visitors while preserving Sri Lanka’s rich cultural heritage.

“Through initiatives like this, we not only preserve Sri Lanka’s cultural heritage for future generations but also showcase its history and traditions to the world,” US Ambassador Julie Chung said at the opening ceremony on Wednesday.

“This museum stands as a gateway for both Sri Lankans and global visitors to explore the depth of the country’s history, fostering understanding and appreciation while supporting cultural tourism.”

“This project… has made the Kandyan King’s Palace and Archaeology Museum more accessible and enriching for the public,” said Minister Sunil Senevi.

“By conserving the historic infrastructure and upgrading the museum’s displays, we have ensured that visitors — including those with disabilities — can connect with Sri Lanka’s rich cultural heritage in a meaningful way.”

“The preservation work enhances the site, providing both local and global visitors alike with a more immersive and meaningful experience of the rich history and legacy of the Kandy kingdom,” Counselor for Public Affairs at the US Embassy to Sri Lanka, Heidi Hattenbach said. (Colombo/Dec11/2024)
