Shots fired outside Salman Khan’s house in Mumbai’s Bandra

Shots were fired outside Bollywood actor Salman Khan’s house in Mumbai’s Bandra on Sunday morning, Indian media reported.

At least four rounds were fired outside the Galaxy Apartments, where the actor resides, at around 5am today.

According to reports, two unidentified gunmen on a motorbike were involved in the incident.

The local police and the crime branch have started a probe into the incident.

In March last year, an e-mail threatening Khan was received at his office following which the Mumbai Police registered an FIR against gangsters Lawrence Bishnoi and Goldy Brar.
