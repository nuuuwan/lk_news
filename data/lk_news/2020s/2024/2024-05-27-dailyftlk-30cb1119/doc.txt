Sumanthiran thanks President for prioritising Northern development projects

Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP M.A. Sumanthiran on Saturday expressed his gratitude to President Ranil Wickremesinghe over the weekend for Wickremesinghe’s contributions to the Northern Province.

Speaking at the inauguration of the Clinical Training and Research Block at the Jaffna University Faculty of Medicine, Sumanthiran thanked the President for prioritising the Northern Province and visiting to launch numerous development programs.

On Saturday, President Ranil Wickremesinghe inaugurated the Clinical Training and Research Block at the Jaffna University Faculty of Medicine, marking the first new construction at the faculty in 46 years. The project has cost the Government an estimated Rs. 942 million.

Sumanthiran noted that Wickremesinghe had visited Jaffna numerous times as Prime Minister during the Good Governance Government, taking significant steps to alleviate the hardships faced by the people of the North.

The TNA MP remarked that it seems Wickremesinghe has a soft spot for Jaffna, possibly because the region contributed to his defeat in the 2005 Presidential election.

“The people of Jaffna too remember this with some regret,” he said. The MP mentioned that initially, he wondered if the event was being used for election propaganda but emphasised that it was not.

“I will refrain from saying anything more in case it is misinterpreted,” he added, noting that the populace however appreciates everything the President is doing for the North.
