100 intelligence officers reassigned for security in Colombo

Colombo, April 5 (Daily Mirror) - Around 100 Intelligence Officers from the police in the Western Province have been discharged from their duties and reassigned to security duties in Colombo.

Inspector General of Police Deshabandu Tennakoon had instructed to deploy officers attached to the Intelligence Service in the Western Province for general duties in Colombo to enhance security and prevent crimes like vehicle thefts and gold necklace robberies especially during the Sinhala and Tamil New Year season.

During the last few weeks, the police have intensified operations against the underworld and drug activities island-wide deploying a significant number of personnel for these tasks.

Intelligence officers previously stationed in the Western Province have been redeployed for general duties in Colombo, as the police maintain their special operations against underworld activities and drug trafficking.

Earlier, in response to concerns about police collusion with drug lords, intelligence officers have been tasked with identifying corrupt officers involved in such activities. Accordingly, Intelligence officers were also deployed to gather information about such corrupt officers.

Meanwhile Police Spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa said that the ongoing special operations targeting criminals and drug traffickers will continue despite the upcoming festival season.
