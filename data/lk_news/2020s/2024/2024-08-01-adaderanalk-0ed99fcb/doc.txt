Hamas military chief killed in air strike, Israel says

Israel’s military says it killed Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif in an air strike in Gaza on 13 July.

Deif was targeted in an Israeli strike on a compound in the Khan Younis area.

Israel says Deif was one of the figures responsible for the planning of the 7 October attacks in southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed.

Israel’s announcement comes after the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismael Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran, and senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, who was killed in an Israeli air strike on the Lebanese capital, Beirut.

Mohammed Deif was head of the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the military arm of the Hamas movement.

He was imprisoned by Israeli authorities in 1989, after which he formed the Brigades with the aim of capturing Israeli soldiers.

Israel accused him of planning and supervising bus bombings which killed tens of Israelis in 1996, and of involvement in the capture and killing of three Israeli soldiers in the mid-1990s.

He is also known to have helped engineer the construction of tunnels that have allowed Hamas fighters to get inside Israel from Gaza.
