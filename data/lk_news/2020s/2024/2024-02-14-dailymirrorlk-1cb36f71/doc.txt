Ongoing health strike to be called off

Colombo, Feb 14 (Daily Mirror) - After days of tense negotiations and widespread disruptions in healthcare services, all 72 health sector trade unions have opted to call off their ongoing strike.

Accordingly, the strike will be called off at 6.30 am tomorrow (15).

This decision follows Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana's agreement to engage in a discussion slated for next Monday.

The ongoing strike, which has left hospitals and clinics grappling with reduced staff and limited services raised concerns about the impact on patient care nationwide.
