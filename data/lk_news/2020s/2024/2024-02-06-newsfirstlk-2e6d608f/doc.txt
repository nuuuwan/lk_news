15,000 Tons Of Cashew Imports Approved

COLOMBO (News 1st); The Sri Lankan Cabinet has approved the import of 15,000 tons of cashew nuts in shell to address a domestic shortage and support the local industry.

This decision comes after the country's cashew harvest fell short of expectations, leaving a significant gap between demand and supply.

Sri Lanka's annual cashew nut requirement stands at around 25,000 tons, but domestic production currently only yields 12,500 tons.

To bridge this gap, the government has authorized the import of 15,000 tons to ensure sufficient supply for the remaining year.
