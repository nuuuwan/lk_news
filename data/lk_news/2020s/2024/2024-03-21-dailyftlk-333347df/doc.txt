Govt. initiates measures to support farmers ahead of Yala cultivation season

The Government has announced crucial decisions aimed at ensuring the availability and affordability of essential chemical fertilizers for farmers countrywide.

The National Fertiliser Secretariat estimates indicate the required volume of urea, TSP (Triple Super Phosphate), and MOP (Muriateo of Potash) for the upcoming season.

To address the fertilizer needs for the 2024 ‘Yala’ season, the Cabinet of Ministers approved a proposal submitted by Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera to implement several crucial measures.

Firstly, fertiliser importation will be facilitated through State-run, the Ceylon Fertiliser Company Ltd., and the Colombo Commercial Fertiliser Company Ltd.

In addition, the Government has allocated a subsidy of Rs. 15,000 per hectare for farmers, with a maximum of two hectares per farmer, during the 2024 Yala cultivation season. The financial aid, administered through the Department of Agricultural Development, aims to ease the financial burden on farmers and enhance agricultural productivity.

In an effort to move towards greater transparency and efficiency, subsidies will be directly credited to farmers’ bank accounts.

The streamlined approach to subsidy distribution seeks to expedite the process and ensure timely support to agricultural stakeholders.

The proposal to this effect submitted by Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers at its meeting on Monday.
