Sri Lanka seeks public-private partnership to train Olympic contenders: minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is considering a public private partnership to develop the skills of school level athletes for the 2032 Brisbane Olympics, cabinet spokesman minister Bandula Gunawardena said.

“The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Sports and Youth Affairs have planned to implement a joint program with the support of the private sector and civil society to make Sri Lanka a medal winning country in the 2032 Brisbane Olympics,” Gunawardena told reporters on Tuesday.

“We need to have technologically-developed private businesses and entrepreneurs investing in this,” Gunawardena said.

Sri Lanka’s cabinet of ministers approved the proposal to seek a public-private partnership this week.

It is also expected to provide opportunities for talented athletes to participate in the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. (Colombo/Jun4/2024)
