SriLankan clarifies flight delays

Colombo, Feb 25 (Daily Mirror) - SriLankan Airlines clarified that the delays experienced by passengers at the check-in counters in Bandaranaike International Airport during the early hours of the morning were due to temporary, unplanned operational conditions at the airport and not any form of trade union action.

The check-in counter operations have since stabilized and returned to normal.

SriLankan Airlines extends apologies to any inconvenienced passengers and assures continued monitoring of the situation to prevent recurrence.
