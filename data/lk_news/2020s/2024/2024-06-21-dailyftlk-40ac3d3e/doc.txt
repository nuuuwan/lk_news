Bakeer Markar calls for accountability over breach of his Parliamentary privileges

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Imthiaz Bakeer Markar in an address to Parliament yesterday highlighted significant breaches of his Parliamentary privileges, as revealed in a recent report by the Committee on Parliamentary Ethics and Privileges.

He noted that the report found that a Private Members Bill submitted by him on youth representation, was eventually passed as a proposal put forward by ruling party MP Premanath C. Dolawatta.

Citing the Parliamentary Privileges Committee report, Bakeer Markar pointed out numerous irregularities in the bill’s submission process to the Parliamentary Drafting Office and the Attorney General’s Department.

“It is evident that this unfairness resulted from a deliberate failure to adhere to established procedures for bills presented by individual members,” Bakeer Markar said. He urged MPs to review specific sections of the report that highlight these injustices.

According to Bakeer Markar, his bill, submitted on 6 January 2022, in all three languages, was processed significantly slower compared to a similar bill from a ruling party MP, which was submitted in Sinhala six months later. Despite this, the latter bill received expedited handling and was sent to the Attorney General’s Department just four days after its completion, whereas his own bill faced a two-month delay.

“In the report presented to Parliament, the last paragraph on page nine and the first two paragraphs on page 10 merit your honourable attention. These sections clearly outline some of the deliberate injustices,” the MP noted.

“According to the report, my bill, in all three languages, was received by the Drafting Office on 6 January 2022. However, it is mentioned that the bill from the other ruling party MP, which was only in Sinhala, was received approximately six months later. The completed bill in all three languages was received by the Bill Office on 22 August 2022, indicating that the second bill was received more than seven months after my bill,” he said.

“The next point is that my bill, presented on 6 January 2022, was sent by Parliament to the Attorney General’s Department almost two months after its receipt. However, four days after the other MP’s completed bill was received, it was sent to the Attorney General’s Department,” he added.

“The committee has concluded that there has been an injustice, and there should be accountability for this,” Bakeer Markar emphasised. He called for thorough investigations to identify and hold accountable those responsible for the procedural lapses to prevent future occurrences.

Bakeer Markar underscored the importance of maintaining the independence and dignity of Parliament, especially in an era when the public is vigilant about threats to the judiciary’s independence and potential manipulations of the Attorney General’s Department. “It is crucial to ensure that no one escapes accountability for actions that undermine, tarnish, and defame the Parliament,” he asserted.

In his appeal to the Speaker, Bakeer Markar requested serious attention to the matter and appropriate measures to uphold Parliament’s honour, dignity, and independence. He stressed that those who attempt to belittle or tarnish these values should not be allowed to evade accountability.
