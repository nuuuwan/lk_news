Sri Lanka, New Zealand discuss strengthening bilateral ties: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka and New Zealand have discussed expansion of bilateral relations between the two countries in trade, education, dairy industry and sports, the country’s Minister of Trade said after a meeting with the High Commissioner.

New Zealand High Commissioner David Pine met Minister of Trade, Commerce and Food Safety Nalin Fernando at the Ministry recently.

New Zealand will provide its support to promote the tourism industry, the High Commissioner was quoted as saying by a government statement.

Pine believed it was important for Sri Lanka to be unique in the international market under one or more products under one name instead of competing in the international market under different brands.

Sri Lanka is focused on the diversification of local products in the international market Fernando said.

Pine also praised the Sri Lankan origin population in New Zealand as a group with high labor skills. (Colombo/Aug7/2024)
