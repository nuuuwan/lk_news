Sterling Steels Ltd., a newly renamed entity emerging from the acquisition of BlueScope Lysaght Lanka Ltd. by E.B. Creasy & Co. PLC, was officially launched at a grand event held at the ITC Ratnadipa recently.

Alongside its corporate and flagship brand launch, Sterling Steels Ltd. additionally introduced the innovative ‘MaxSeamTM 470’ roofing system – a next-gen 360° seam locked roofing system – to the Sri Lankan market for the first time.

The launch event was attended by top management from leading corporates, together with renowned architects and engineers and other esteemed guests, marking a significant milestone in the company’s history.

E.B. Creasy & Co. PLC Managing Director Sanjeev Rajaratnam expressed his enthusiasm, saying: “The evolution of BlueScope Lysaght Lanka into Sterling Steels Ltd., the launch of ‘Sterling Ultra’ to replace Lysaght, and the introduction of ‘MaxSeamTM 470’ under the E.B. Creasy umbrella, marks a significant leap forward on our journey to deliver world-class solutions to our customers. With our extensive industry experience, innovative product offerings, and unwavering commitment to quality, we are ready to set new benchmarks in the roofing and structural products industry. This is a proud moment for us as we continue to build on our legacy and drive growth in the Sri Lankan market.”

The emergence of Sterling Steels Ltd. marks a strategic move that brings together E.B. Creasy & Co. PLC’s 146 years of industry leadership with the company’s 30+ years of unparalleled expertise in roofing and structural products (previously as BlueScope Lysaght Lanka Ltd.).

Founded in November 1993, under the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI), and originally established by BHP Steel Building Products Lanka Ltd., Sterling Steels Ltd. has long been synonymous with the development, production, and marketing of steel roofing and cladding systems in Sri Lanka. Its acquisition by E.B. Creasy & Co. PLC heralds a new era of growth and innovation for the company, enhancing its ability to offer top-tier products and solutions to its diverse customers.

With a rich history of over 30 years, the company has earned a reputation as a trusted supplier of industrial materials, offering a range of metal building products and systems utilising high-quality ZINCALUME® and COLORBOND® steel. These materials are available in a selection of modern colours and shapes, suitable for industrial, commercial, residential, and public building applications. Sterling Steels has also been instrumental in pioneering innovative construction solutions, consistently meeting the evolving needs of the Sri Lankan market. Additionally, the company’s commitment to sustainability is reflected in its use of eco-friendly materials and energy-efficient production processes.

The MaxSeamTM 470 roofing system, constructed using MaxSeamTM 470 Roofing and Walling, is engineered for exceptional weather-tightness and suited for large industrial, commercial, and warehousing buildings. With onsite customisation enabled by a mobile factory, MaxSeamTM 470 ensures efficient delivery and installation, offering longer spans, superior performance, and a zero-defect rate. Constructed using high-strength COLORBOND® and ZINCALUME® steel, the system combines aesthetics with enhanced corrosion resistance. Its innovative 360° Pittsburgh Double-Lock Seam, akin to those in beverage cans and fuel tanks, provides the industry’s tightest seal, creating a durable, monolithic roof structure.

With these strategic advancements, Sterling Steels Ltd., supported by its new parent company E.B. Creasy & Co. PLC, is poised to redefine industry standards in Sri Lanka, delivering innovative, high-quality roofing and cladding solutions while continuing its legacy of excellence. As the company embarks on this new chapter of its growth story, it remains committed to serving its customers with unmatched quality, expertise, and dedication.
