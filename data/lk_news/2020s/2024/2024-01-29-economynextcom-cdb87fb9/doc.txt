British ship HMS Spey arrives in Sri Lanka

ECONOMYNEXT – The Royal Navy’s HMS Spey, a 90.5m long Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) manned by a crew of 56, arrived at the port of Colombo on a formal visit over the weekend (28).

The ship was welcomed by the Sri Lanka Navy, a statement by the Navy said, adding that “During the ship’s stay in Colombo, its crew members will visit some of the tourist attractions of the country.”

Commanding Officer of the ship Paul Caddy will call on the Commander Western Naval Area and the Director General Operations.

The ship will conduct a Passage Exercise (PASSEX) with a Sri Lanka Navy ship in Colombo seas, and depart the island on January 31.

According to the Royal Navy’s website, the HMS Spey represents “the UK’s commitment to our persistent presence in the Indo Pacific. Spey is currently operating in South East Asia and the Indian Ocean supporting regional partners with anti-smuggling, fishery protection, border patrol and counter terrorism operations.”

President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s government has temporarily halted foreign research ships after strong security concerns raised by neighbour India and the United States after the visit of two Chinese research vessels.
