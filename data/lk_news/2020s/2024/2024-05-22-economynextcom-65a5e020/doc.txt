Sri Lanka opposition leader asks for jobs for unemployed graduates, more salaries

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka opposition leader asked for permanent jobs 465 unemployed graduates and to clear ‘salary anomalies’ of a group of state workers.

There was no information on how much more tax payer funds are needed to pay for additional state workers.

“There was an anomaly, when appointments were given to 50,000-60,000 graduates, because of shortcomings on the officials part in processing documents, 465 graduates were overlooked.”

Premadasa said he had also asked for appointments for 465 unemployed graduates on a previous occasion too but there has been no response from the government.

He also asked for 2,064 people manning railway crossings who were only paid 7,500 rupees a month, to be given permanent appointments. (Colombo/May22/2024)
