Is Biden dishonest about his health problems?

It certainly would be exceptional, if anyone who is lucky enough to live past seven decades, has no medical problems at all. It may happen with holy men practising meditation in the Himalayas or those living in isolated communities shielded from the stresses of the modern world but among only around two percent who survive to be 80, the vast majority would have physical or mental disabilities or both.

Compromised memory was once considered to be an invariable effect of ageing, due to brain cells lost over time being not replaced. But fortunately for us, the old fogeys, scientists have had a rethink. The relatively new concept of neuroplasticity gives us hope and human brain seems to be smarter than scientists thought. It compensates for loss of cells by making new connections. However, minor degrees of cognitive impairment are bound to occur with age, even if there are no physical problems but these could be compensated with minor adjustments and live a normal life.

Problems arise when you do not want to accept the reality, as seems to be the case with the most powerful man in the world! Having painfully watched the US Presidential Debate on June 28, I wrote “God save America” (The island, July 1), whiere I concluded: “There is no mechanism to replace Biden, the only avenue open being him opting to withdraw. That does not seem to be happening. If he does not and wins the race in November, the only choice is to say: God save America”.

I am very thankful to Mr Vijaya Chandrasoma for his very complimentary remarks, referring to my analysis, in his piece titled “Biden celebrates July 4 amid doubts about his political future” (Sunday Island, July 7) wherein he charts President Biden’s admirable journey and ends his piece with following:

“May I respectfully point out to Dr Wijayawardhana that if President Biden does not withdraw and wins the race in November, then God would indeed have saved America. The real problem would arise if Biden does not withdraw and loses the election to the Orange Jesus. In that event, there will be no God in all the heavens who will be able to save America from becoming a satellite kleptocracy of Putin’s Russia.”

Till I read this, I did not realize the enormity of the problems faced by USA too, in addition to the president. Even though he has identifies himself as an “ardent supporter of the Democratic cause and a virulent Never Trumper” still, I do not find any justification for the comment; “Whatever doom and gloom polls project, I am confident that Trump, the most evil and ignorant human being in history, will be defeated in November, even by a reasonably rational cockroach.”

Is Trump the most evil and ignorant human being in history? I greatly doubt that! I can name quite a few far worse than Trump in human history. What about our 225 in Diyawannawa who refused to unite to save the Motherland at its darkest hour?

Is Biden a paragon of virtue? Was he honest about his health? If he is hiding his health problems just to get re-elected as president, is that not evil? Anyway, disabilities should not prevent anyone being elected president, if that disability does not hinder the performance of the functions of state. After all, Franklin D Roosevelt, who served an unprecedented four terms, had residual paralysis from polio which did not prevent his election.

In our finals in Medicine, we had spot diagnosis and with that training my spot diagnosis, the way Biden walked to the podium with a shuffling gait and a vacant expression, was Parkinsonism. Therefore, I found it very interesting the front-page news item in The Daily Telegraph of July 8 titled “Biden’s doctor met Parkinson’s expert” wherein it stated “Joe Biden’s doctor met a leading Parkinson’s disease specialist in the White House earlier this year, it has emerged amid ongoing questions about the US president’s health. Dr Kevin Cannard, a neurologist met Dr Kevin O’Connor, Mr Biden’s physician, on Jan 17 and visited the White House a further seven times in the past year. Mr Biden has refused to take a cognitive test amid speculations about his health following last month’s television debate with Donald Trump”. This was denied by the White House, as expected.

Biden’s ABC interview with George Stephanopoulos, from Maison, Wisconsin, done on July 6 to allay anxieties, added to concerns. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kpibhlagG0)

During the debate, Biden’s staff attributed his bad performance to a cold but at a subsequent fundraiser Biden claimed that he had jet-lag. As this is not a feasible explanation, as jet-lag does not last 12 days, he reverted to the virus story in this interview and made another blunder. Having said that he was tested for Covid, he said “I thought I had a virus. I didn’t. I had a cold.” Perhaps, he is not aware that colds are also due to viruses!

When he was asked whether he watched the debate his reply was “I don’t think I watched the debate!” Did he not remember that? Should he have not have watched, had he wanted to improve in the next debate?

Another reason he attributed for his bad performance was that he was distracted by Trump shouting at him even when his microphone was off. I watched the debate and Trump did not scream at him when the microphone was off, or anytime. In fact, it was an unexpectedly restrained performance by Trump but he used the tactic of answering the previous question, not the current, when it suited him.

Even if Biden has Parkinsonism, it may slow him down but not impair mental function unless he has the rare type associated with dementia. In the debate, Trump stated that he had cognitive testing done and challenged Biden to do the same but he evaded. During the interview he was asked the same and his reply was astonishing. He said he has neurological tests done daily, as he sits in his desk and runs the world. He seems clueless what a neurological test is.

He said that he spoke to the Prime Minister but could not remember who, mumbling Netanyahu after a time. Though he claims he runs the world, does Netanyahu listen to him? Netanyahu does exactly what he wants and Biden is left to find excuses to defend him.

Biden could have silenced all his critics by just doing one simple thing; by taking a cognitive test. But he seems to be avoiding it at all cost which leaves only one conclusion.

Biden is definitely dishonest about his health and more. His comment that he runs the world raises serious concerns. Is this the megalomanic belief of his electorate or delusions of grandeur of a dementing octogenarian?
