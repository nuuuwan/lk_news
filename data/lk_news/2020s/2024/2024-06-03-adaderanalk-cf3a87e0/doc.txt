Temporary decrease in heavy rains expected

A temporary decrease in the prevailing heavy rain conditions in the southwestern part of the island is expected from tomorrow (04), the Department of Meteorology says.

In its latest forecast, the department said that the showers or thundershowers will occur at times in Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central, Southern and North-western provinces.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places elsewhere of the island during the evening or night, it added.

Thus, the general public is advised to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
