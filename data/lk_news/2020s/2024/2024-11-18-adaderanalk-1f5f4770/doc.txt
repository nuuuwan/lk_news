Rs. 311M received as compensation Easter attack victims; SC calls for report on distribution

The Attorney General (AG) today informed the Supreme Court that the Office for Reparations has received Rs. 311 million in total as compensation for the victims of the Easter Sunday terror attacks, as per the court order issued in relation to the petitions filed in this regard.

The Additional Solicitor General, who appeared on behalf of the AG, informed this to the court today (18), when the Fundamental Rights (FR) petitions filed related to the Easter Sunday terror attacks were taken up this morning.

Accordingly, the Supreme Court judge bench ordered the Additional Solicitor General to submit a report pertaining to the manner in which the relevant compensations have been disbursed to the victims, on the next court date.

The petitions were subsequently ordered to be recalled on February 27, 2025.

The petitions were taken up for consideration before a three-member Supreme Court judge bench consisting of Justices Murdu Fernando, S. Thurairaja and A.H.M.D. Nawaz.
