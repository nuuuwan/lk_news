Prices of imported eggs to increase

The prices of eggs imported from India are slated to be increased with effect from 21 January, Trade Minister Nalin Fernando revealed.

According to the Minister, these eggs will be retailed at Rs. 43 per egg at all Sathosa outlets countrywide.

Imported eggs were previously retailed at Rs. 35 per egg, while a carton was sold at Rs. 40 per egg at all Lanka Sathosa outlets.

Sri Lanka began to import eggs in the first half of 2023, amidst a severe shortage, in response to the soaring prices of eggs within the local market.
