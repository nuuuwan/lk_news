Blow for Sri Lanka as Hasaranga suspended for Bangladesh Tests

March 19 - Sri Lanka all-rounder Wanindu Hasaranga has been suspended for Bangladesh's two-Test series against Bangladesh, shortly after announcing his decision to return to Test cricket having retired from the format last year.

During the third ODI in the recently-concluded series against Bangladesh, Hasaranga was found guilty of breaching article 2.8 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to “showing dissent at an Umpire’s decision during an International Match.”

The incident occurred in the 37th over of the game when Hasaranga snatched his cap from one of the umpires and ridiculed the umpiring in the match.

Bangladesh took the series 2-1 after winning the contest by four wickets.
