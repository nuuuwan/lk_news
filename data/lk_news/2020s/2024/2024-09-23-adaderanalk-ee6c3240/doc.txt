Former Sri Lankan President Gotabaya arrives in Kathmandu - report

Former president of Sri Lanka Gotabaya Rajapaksa has landed at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, NepalÂ via Sri Lankan Airlines on Monday.

A source within the embassy stated that he has plans to visit different Buddhist sites and is also scheduled to visit Bharatpur.

It is reported that Rajapaksa is believed to have close ties with the Chaudhary Group, which has investments in various sectors in Sri Lanka and has been inviting him to visit Nepal. This trip is more personal and family-oriented rather than political.

Rajapaksa will be staying at Hotel Vivanta in Jhamsikhel today.

Following a massive uprising in Sri Lanka, Rajapaksa had to flee the country two years ago. He later returned to Sri Lanka.

In Sri Lanka, the newly elected President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who is Marxist-leaning, was sworn in today.
