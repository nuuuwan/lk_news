Sing with the stars…

Sohan & The X-Periments are certainly the champs when it comes to sing-along events.

What makes them stand out from the rest is their ability to provide the right kind of music, and the excitement, generally associated with such events, and in Sohan they have an entertainer plus, plus!

Sohan, no doubt, is a great entertainer, and he makes his presence felt, in an awesome way, at these musical evenings of family entertainment.

Before the pandemic, Sohan & The X-Perments were the stars at the sing-along sessions put together by Shiromi Perera and the Rhythm World Dance Studio, along with The Island/Sunday Island, and they were crowd-pullers.

Of course, Sohan, as a solo artiste, continues to be very active in the showbiz scene, not only locally but abroad as well, and on 29th June, he will be seen in action, with the X-Periments, of course, at the BMICH banquet hall.

The occasion is a sing-along but this event is very special as it’s in aid of the Pediatric Ward of the Cancer Hospital, Maharagama.

Organised by Symphony Pvt. Ltd., and The Island/Sunday Island, this ‘Golden Memories XI Sing-along’ will also bring into the spotlight Mignonne and Suraj, Nilanka, Sureshni and Ishini.

It will certainly be an evening loaded with great music, and lots of fun and excitement.

What’s more, those in the audience could also make their presence felt by exercising their vocal cords, with the assistance of the stars at this show, and that’s what sing-along events are all about.

Tickets, priced at Rs. 4,500/=, includes a Buffet Dinner, as well, and could be obtained from Dushyantha M. Dias Abeyegunawardene, 438/2, Havelock Road, Colombo 6. Tel: 112585172 / 0777789226.
