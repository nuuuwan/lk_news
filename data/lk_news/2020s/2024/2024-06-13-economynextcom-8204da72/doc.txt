Sri Lanka to investigate SIS, CNI actions prior to Easter attack

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s President Ranil Wickremesinghe has appointed a committee of inquiry to investigate the actions taken by the State Intelligence Service (SIS), Chief of National Intelligence (CNI), and other relevant authorities concerning prior intelligence received about the bomb attacks on April 21, 2019.

The decision follows the findings of the final report of the commission of inquiry, which highlighted that Indian Intelligence agencies and other sources had provided advance warnings about the impending attacks.

“The committee’s mandate includes examining whether adequate actions and measures were taken by the SIS, CNI, and other relevant authorities based on the prior intelligence and evaluating the sufficiency of these measures,” the president’s media division said in a statement.

The committee is expected to submit its findings and recommendations by September 15.

The committee will investigate the circumstances surrounding the Directorate of Military Intelligence’s (DMI) initial belief that the Vavunathivu killing of two police officers on November 30, 2018, was connected to the LTTE.

This belief was held for four months before suspects with alleged links to the National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ) were identified.

The committee will be chaired by retired judge of the high court A N J De Alwis. Other members include SLAS special grade officer K N K Somaratne and senior lawyer W M A N Nishane, AAL.

A compact disk containing the Final Report of the Commission of Inquiry on the Bomb Attacks of April 21, 2019, has been provided to the committee.

The 2019 Easter Sunday bombings killed 279 people, including 45 foreign nationals.

The President has authorized the committee to inquire relevant officials and examine pertinent documents to thoroughly investigate these matters. (Colombo/Jun13/2024)
