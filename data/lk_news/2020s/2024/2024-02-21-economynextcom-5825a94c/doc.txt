Sri Lanka stocks close up, consumer sector picking up

ECONOMYNEXT – The Colombo Stock Exchange closed up on Wednesday, data on its site showed.

The broader All Share Index closed up 11.24 points, or 0.11 percent at 10,649 while the S&P SL20 Index closed up at 3,070 points, up 0.05 percent, or 1.48 points.

Turnover was at 880 million. “Buyers are coming into the market, but it doesn’t translate to significant turnover because they are at lower prices,” a market participant said.

Sectors that attracted investor interest were Capital Goods (196mn), Food, Beverage and Tobacco (189mn), and Banks (167mn).

Royal Ceramics Lanka Plc saw high volumes traded, contributing 59 million to the day’s turnover, and the share closed up at 29.60.

With the uptick in tourist arrivals there was construction in hotels, “mainly refurbishment, in the construction sector” market participants said. “So there is buying interest in tiles, not cement.”

Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka Plc also saw high volumes traded, contributing 38 million to the day’s turnover. The share closed down at 26.80. This was mostly due to speculation on dividend announcement which came later in the day.
