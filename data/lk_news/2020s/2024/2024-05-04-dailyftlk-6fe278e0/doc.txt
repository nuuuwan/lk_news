IUSF condemns repression and arrests of US university students

Calls on US universities to divest from direct investments in companies doing business in, or with Israel

Urges US Govt. to stop the violent repression of protesting university students and faculty

Expresses their solidarity with US students and calls for amnesty for all students and faculty arrested

Inter-University Students’ Federation (IUSF) of Sri Lanka has condemned the repression and arrest of University students across the United States who are calling for an end to the US-backed, Israeli onslaught against Palestine.

The IUSF handed over a letter to the US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung yesterday, expressing their opposition to the actions of US law enforcement.

The IUSF also called on US universities to divest from direct investments in companies doing business in, or with Israel.

“Some universities such as Yale, for example, are calling for the divestment from military weapons manufacturers that aid Israel’s siege on Gaza. At the University of Columbia, students are targeting tech companies such as Google, which has a cloud computing deal with the Government of Israel,” it said.

Highlighting the many instances of arrests and cracking down on protests by police, the IUSF called on the US Government to stop the violent repression of protesting university students and faculty.

“We unconditionally stand alongside fellow university students and faculty in the US, in their fight to free Palestine. We reiterate their calls for their universities to divest from Israel, thereby stopping their supporting of the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people, and to ensure an amnesty to all students and faculty arrested, or facing disciplinary action in connection with these protests,” it said.
