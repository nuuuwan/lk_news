Vice Chancellor Prof. Niranjan Gunawardana, and EDB Chairman and CEO Dr. Kingsly Bernard highlighted the significance of collaboration in Research and Development. They pointed out that these partnerships are vital for fostering effective and sustainable practices in key sectors, benefitting both the business community and society at large.

This initiative designed as a two-year program that starts this year, aimed at fostering collaboration among selected companies to develop innovative solutions that enhance global market competitiveness. The EDB aims to cultivate partnerships between industry and academia, facilitating connections between businesses and university research to address complex research challenges with practical applications.

Currently, two projects initiated by Venora Lanka Power Panels Ltd. and Sentinel Systems are in progress under this initiative, focusing on the creation of IoT-enabled power distribution

systems and Advanced Building Management Systems. These projects utilise cutting-edge technologies to address rising energy costs and alleviate financial burdens on individuals and businesses. Also, this will empower individuals to track their daily electricity usage, enabling informed decision-making by transforming complex data into practical business insights, thus providing essential information for both individuals and organisational leaders.

Both EDB and the University of Moratuwa are confident that this partnership between two entities marks a significant advancement in developing effective business solutions for Sri Lanka’s construction services, renewable energy and engineering sectors, with the expectation of inspiring new ideas and driving progress in the renewable energy field.
