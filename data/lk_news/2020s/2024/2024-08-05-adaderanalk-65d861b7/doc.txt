SLPP to reveal presidential candidate on Wednesday

The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) says that its presidential candidate will be announced on Wednesday (Aug 07).

However, many constituency meetings of the SLPP are passing resolutions in order to back incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe during the 2024 presidential election.

In the meantime, State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe has responded to the letter issued by the party’s General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam stating that disciplinary action will be taken against SLPP members who defy the decision reached by its politburo regarding the upcoming election.

Semasinghe has pointed out, in writing, that neither he nor the supporters of the SLPP are bound by the resolution passed by the party’s politburo on July 29.

He has also stated that accordingly, actions will be taken against any disciplinary action that the party would seek against them and that they will not hesitate to make the right decisions in the face of the challenges that the country is currently facing.
