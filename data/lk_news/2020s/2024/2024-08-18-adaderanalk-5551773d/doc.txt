Sajith vows to uncover truth behind Easter attacks

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa has pledged to expose the truth behind the Easter Sunday terror attacks, fulfilling the expectations of the people, particularly the country’s Catholic community.

Premadasa made this remark during a visit to the Colombo Archbishop’s residence, where he met with His Eminence Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith and the Assistant Bishops of the Colombo Archdiocese to seek their blessings.

The SJB leader and presidential candidate assured that he has a clear plan to uncover the truth, a plan that has already been presented in Parliament.

He emphasized that the entire nation, led by the Catholic community, is questioning whether the investigations into the Easter attacks were conducted transparently and whether the truth has been fully disclosed.

During the meeting, Premadasa promised Cardinal Ranjith and the Bishops that he would leave no stone unturned in his pursuit of justice.

He vowed to implement a programme aimed at uncovering the root causes of the attack without any discrimination, ensuring that all those involved will be held accountable and face the maximum punishment.
