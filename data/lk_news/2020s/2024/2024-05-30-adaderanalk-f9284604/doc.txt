Isuru Gunathilake’s “Sheysha” wins Best Dance Film at Cannes World Film Festival 2024

“Sheysha” by Sri Lankan filmmaker Isuru Gunathilake has been adjudged the winner in the ‘Best Dance Film’ category at World Film Festival in Cannes.

“Sheysha”, a movie that brings to the screen Sri Lanka’s traditional dance and a father-son relationship, is directed by young Sri Lankan filmmaker Isuru Gunathilake from a script by Samantha Kumara Gamage.

It is a loving story which centers around a ‘Gurunnanse’ and his beloved son who try to protect their art as their life in a politically unconscious and culturally corrupted society. “ Sheysha” is a story about people who are trying to preserve an art which uniquely remains as a remnant in human society.

Gunathilake’s 2020 short film ’The Vultures’ won the Human Rights Prize at the Agenda 14 Short Film Festival 2020, and a merit award and a Jury Award for Best Actor at the ninth Youth Film Festival 2020.
