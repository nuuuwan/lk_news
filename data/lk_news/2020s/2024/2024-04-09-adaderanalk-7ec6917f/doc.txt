The Election Commission of Sri Lanka has commenced the activities related to preparing the electoral register for this year starting today (April 09).

The activities pertaining to the preparation of electoral register will be carried out until May 10, as per the Election Secretariat.

Accordingly, this allows the individuals whose names are not included in the electoral register despite being eligible to cast their votes, to add their names to the relevant lists.

Thus, Election Secretariat further announced that the eligible voters now have the opportunity to include their names in the electoral register from respective Grama Niladhari offices or the election offices across the island.

Meanwhile, the Election Commission will be authorized to call for nominations for the Presidential Election on any date after July 17, 2024.

However, it is expected that the Presidential Election is likely to take place in the end of September or in the first week of October.

Earlier on April 01, the Election Commission also stated that the preliminary arrangements required to hold the presidential election have been completed.
