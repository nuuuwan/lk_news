US grants $ 58.5 m for education and health initiatives

Cabinet approves signing MoU with relevant parties to initiate and execute the project effectively

The US Government has allocated an additional grant of $ 32.5 million of the total $ 58.5 million to implement the second phase to execute a project focused on promoting self-governance, literacy and attention through market alliances.

The investment, facilitated through the United States Department of Agriculture and Save the Children organisation, underscores the ongoing partnership between the two countries in promoting self-governance, literacy and healthcare through market alliances.

In 2018, the US Government provided a grant of $ 26 million to Sri Lanka to implement a project focused on promoting self-governance, literacy and attention through market alliances.

Scheduled for completion by the second quarter of 2024, the initiative aims to address critical societal issues and uplift communities countrywide. The Cabinet of Ministers approved the proposal presented by the President in his capacity as the Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies Minister to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with relevant parties to initiate and execute the project effectively. The second phase is strategically designed to address short-term resource gaps in the School Meal Program, enhance healthcare services for schools and communities, improve school-age literacy, promote sanitation, and strengthen support systems and capacity for sustainability.
