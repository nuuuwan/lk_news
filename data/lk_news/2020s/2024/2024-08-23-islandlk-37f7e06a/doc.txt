CEAT unveils another radial masterpiece in Sri Lanka for high-end SUVs

Says CEAT Czar HT 265/65 R 17 designed and tested in Germany meets expectations of Toyota Land Cruiser and Mitsubishi Montero users

CEAT Kelani Holdings has reinforced its status as a big-league player in the tyre industry with the launch of a new whopper in the radial segment for high-end SUVs battling Sri Lanka’s roads and tracks.

Designed, engineered and tested in the company’s state-of-the-art R&D Centre in Frankfurt, Germany, the CEAT Czar HT (265/65 R 17) is manufactured for Toyota Land Cruiser Prado 120 and Prado 150, Toyota Hilux and Mitsubishi Montero – vehicles that demand high performance both on and off road.

“This latest masterpiece in radial tyre design and build from our manufacturing plant in Kelaniya is an exciting addition to our portfolio,” CEAT Kelani Chief Operating Officer Shamal Gunawardene said. “It caters to a discerning customer segment that looks for exceptional control, comfort, safety and endurance, characteristics that are hallmarks of CEAT SUV radials. We expect the new tyre to be a formidable competitor for the imported tyre brands that dominate this segment.”

The CEAT Czar HT 265/65 R 17 tyre features special tread groove profiling, an aggressive tread pattern and 3-dimensional sipes with a tiger paw footprint for better control and cornering stability. A rim protector and a sidewall protector shield the lower and upper sidewalls from external damage, while the specially-designed sidewalls and tread absorb shocks and vibrations, ensuring tyre safety and a safer ride. Optimized pitch sequence results in lower noise, smooth handling and ride comfort.

CEAT is the only locally manufactured tyre brand to be IATF 16949:2016 certified by the International Automotive Task Force (IATF) as compliant with the International Standard for Automotive Quality Management Systems, and the new tyre is backed by a four-year warranty from the date of manufacture, the Company said.

All CEAT car radials manufactured in Sri Lanka are designed and tested at the R&D Center in Frankfurt by German engineers, whose mandate is to deliver the most controlled and comfortable driving experience on Sri Lankan roads. The tyres are tested rigorously on a range of premium European cars on various surfaces in wet, dry and even winter conditions to ensure maximum performance via superior tyre compound mixes and innovative tread designs.

The launch of the CEAT Czar HT 265/65 R 17 takes CEAT’s radial tyre portfolio in Sri Lanka to 59 variants.

The CEAT brand originated in Italy and is backed by extensive research and testing facilities in India and Europe. The largest domestic manufacturer of cross-ply and radial tyres in Sri Lanka, CEAT’s emergence as the top brand in the country’s tyre sector is the result of substantial investments over several years that have seen not just exponential increases in volumes but expansion of the product range, the deployment of new technology and quantum improvements in quality. The company’s manufacturing operations encompass pneumatic tyres in the radial (passenger cars, vans and SUVs), commercial (Bias-ply and radial), motorcycle, three-wheeler and agricultural vehicle segments.

CEAT Kelani Holdings currently manufactures half of Sri Lanka’s pneumatic tyre requirements, exports about 20 per cent of its production to 16 countries and plays a significant role in helping the national economy conserve foreign exchange by reducing dependence on imported tyres. The joint venture’s cumulative investment in Sri Lanka over the past decade alone exceeds Rs 8.5 billion.
