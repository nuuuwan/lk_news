CID ordered to expedite investigations into ‘X-Press Pearl’ maritime disaster

The Colombo Magistrate’s Court has ordered the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) to expedite the probes related to the ‘X-Press Pearl’ maritime disaster.

However, the State Counsel who appeared on behalf of the CID when the case was taken up on Thursday (25), has sought a period of one month, in order to present facts in relation to the investigations, Ada Derana reporter said.

The attorneys representing the captain of the destroyed ‘X-Press Pearl’ ship and the directors of the relevant local agent, who have been named as respondents of the case, mentioned that a trial is underway before the Colombo High Court pertaining to the maritime calamity.

They have also raised questions concerning the need for conducting further investigations into the same incident against this backdrop.

The Colombo Additional Magistrate, who took all the facts presented into consideration, ordered the CID to conclude the relevant probes as soon as possible, and to report the progress.
