COLOMBO (News 1st); Maligakanda Magistrate Lochana Abeywickrama ordered Minister Keheliya Rambukwella to report to the Criminal Investigations Department in Colombo at Â 9 AM on Friday (2) to provide a statement.

The statement was made upon considering the submissions that were made by Deputy Solicitor General Lakmini Girihagama on behalf of the Attorney General when the case filed over the controversial human immunoglobulin procurement was taken up in court.

The Deputy Solicitor General also told the court that one of the reasons provided by Keheliya Rambukwella for failing to make a scheduled appearance at the CID on Wednesday (31), is also false.
