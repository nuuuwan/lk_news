Claims Govt. and SJB attempted to dissuade two top cops from joining NPP

Maintains a future NPP Govt. will obtain their support to probe financial frauds and unsolved crimes

National People’s Power (NPP) Executive Council member Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa announced yesterday that the party plans to enlist the support of former top Police officers, Senior DIG Ravi Seneviratne and SSP Shani Abeysekara, to investigate financial frauds under an NPP-led Government.

Seneviratne and Abeysekara recently extended their support to the NPP with Seneviratne taking over as the head of NPP’s Retired Police Collective.

Speaking to the media Dr. Jayatissa emphasised that both officers are distinguished former Police officials, and the NPP will seek their expertise to launch investigations into large-scale frauds and unsolved crimes, including killings.

Dr. Jayatissa made these comments in response to a recent statement by United National Party (UNP) General Secretary, Palitha Range Bandara calling for the Inspector General of Police to launch an inquiry against the two retired officers.

Dr. Jayatissa highlighted that the decision of Seneviratne and Abeysekara to join the NPP and endorse its mission to rebuild the nation has unsettled certain individuals who previously held Governmental, ministerial, and political positions.

“They were officers who executed their duties properly and, as a result, offended many Ministers, MPs, Presidents, and Prime Ministers,” he said.

“We can empathise with their apprehension,” he remarked, attributing such sentiments to Range Bandara’s recent remarks. Range Bandara was himself a police officer prior to entering politics.

Dr. Jayatissa asserted that both the Government and the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) made efforts in the past weeks to dissuade Seneviratne and Abeysekara from supporting the NPP. “Despite pleas and even threats, they remained steadfast in their decision for the country,” he said.
