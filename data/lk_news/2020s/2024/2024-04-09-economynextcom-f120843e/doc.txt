Sri Lanka to offer paid medical degrees through KDU

ECONOMYNEXT – The Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) will offer a paid medical degree programme to students who qualify through the Z score, Minister Bandula Gunawardena said.

“Middle-class families sell their ancestral lands to send their children abroad to countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, and Belarus to study for medical degrees,” Gunawardena said.

“The foreign exchange Sri Lanka gets from migrant workers goes out of the country to pay for our students’ education abroad. This is a crime.”

Gunawardena said this could be addressed by offering fee-levying medical degree programmes locally.

The General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University, is a State defense university administered by the Ministry of Defense. At present it offers study programmes to those who join the defence forces. (Colombo/Apr9/2024)
