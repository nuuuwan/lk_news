Survey reveals growing preference for authoritarianism among Sri Lankans

Colombo, March 16 (Daily Mirror) - A recent survey conducted by the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) has unearthed concerning trends regarding democratic governance in Sri Lanka.

The survey, titled ‘Survey on Democracy and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka,’ involved 1,350 participants across 25 districts in January, shedding light on shifting attitudes toward authoritarianism and declining trust in democratic institutions.

According to the findings, approximately 1 in 10 Sri Lankans expressed a preference for authoritarian rule, marking a significant increase since 2018.

Despite the majority favoring democratic governance, the survey highlighted a worrying sentiment that "In certain situations, a dictatorial government can be preferable to a democratic one."

The CPA, a prominent policy think-tank based in Colombo, emphasized that the spike in support for authoritarianism coincided with the political upheaval during the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government in 2018.

This trend suggests a susceptibility to embracing authoritarian rule amid dissatisfaction with democratic governance.

Furthermore, the survey exposed a sharp decline in public trust toward parliamentary institutions and political parties.
