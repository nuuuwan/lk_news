National Consumer Front urges Minister for swift action on soaring vegetable prices before preparing for polls

Colombo, Jan 29 (Daily Mirror) - Before preparing for the upcoming Presidential election meeting, the National Consumer Front (NCF) requested that Trade Minister Nalin Fernando promptly investigates into the unexpected rise in vegetable prices in the market.

The Front said the prices of vegetables have increased in Dambulla and Nuwara Eliya, and therefore vegetables cannot be sold in the local market as the increase in prices have to be borne by consumers.

According to the prices of the New Manning Market in Peliyagoda, the price of a kilogramme of carrot was Rs. 2,000. A kilo of green chillies, which was Rs. 800, has increased to Rs. 1,200, a kilo of Kekiri has increased to Rs. 300, and a kilo of pumpking has increased to Rs. 300.

National Consumer Front Chairman Asela Sampath requested that Trade Minister Bandula Gunawardena investigate into the sudden price increase of vegetables in the local market and provide immediate solutions to control the prices.

Asela Sampath requested the consumers to stop buying vegetables at higher prices and asked the traders to stop bringing vegetables for at least a week at higher prices to break this mafia.

Sampath also requested that the Minister take immediate legal action against the traders who increase prices inappropriately.
