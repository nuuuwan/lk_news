Sri Lanka presidential election winner will need 7 million votes: UNP

ECONOMYNEXT — If there was 80-percent turnout at Sri Lanka’s 2024 presidential election, a candidate would have to obtain over 7 million votes to win, the United National Party (UNP) said, claiming that this would be an insurmountable challenge for rival party National People’s Power (NPP).

UNP general secretary Palitha Range Bandara speaking at an event on Wednesday July 17 said there are 17.1 million Sri Lankans registered to vote at the presidential election due to be held between September 17 and October 17.

Given that this election has generated widespread interest, he said, a turnout of at least 80 percent can be expected.

“If 80 percent vote, that’s 14 million voters. The winning candidate must get 7 million votes,” he said.

NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake must add 6,550,000 votes to his base, from the 2019 presidential election, to reach this target, said Bandara.

“If you divide this 6.55 million by the 22 electoral districts, the NPP must obtain 318,000 votes per district. The electoral districts of Vanni and Trincomalee don’t even have 318,000 registered voters. That’s a fail right there from the get go,” he said.

The NPP, however, is undeterred and is confident of its chances.

NPP senior and former MP Nalinda Jayatissa said the 2024 presidential poll is the best opportunity for a change of leadership in the country.

“No citizen wants to ask whether the president’s term is five or six years. Only the man in the position wants to know that,” he said, referring to questions raised on the duration of the president’s term.

“The presidential election will be held. This is the best opportunity for us to change power in this country,” said Jayatissa.

Fellow NPP member Samantha Vidyaratne, too, said the election must be held.

“We and the people of this country would like to hold an election and send these leaders home,” he said.

The UNP general secretary met election officials on Wednesday, after which he told the media that the party had in fact requested the election be held on the earliest possible date. Opposition lawmakers, however, have expressed scepticism and apprehension that the government would find a way to delay the poll.

State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe said the election will be held.

“Secondly, if you ask who the candidate is, me and the whole country expect President Ranil Wickremesinghe leading this country over the next five years is very important. Or the country will definitely fall back into a crisis in a matter of days,” he added. (Colombo/Jul18/2024)
