Rail transport of solid waste begins for first time

The transportation of solid waste by train commenced today (25), for the first time in the countryâ€™s history.

The waste, collected from the Wanawasala Garbage Exchange Center, was transported to the Aruvakkadu landfill project in Puttalam by train.

A total of 20 large containers were loaded onto train number 756, which completed the journey to Puttalam before the waste was transferred to the Aruvakkadu landfill.

Despite the initiative, some residents have reportedly expressed opposition to this move. A small group of protesters gathered near Noor Nagar railway station yesterday (24) and again this afternoon, voicing their concerns about the transportation of waste through their area, Ada Derana reporter said.
