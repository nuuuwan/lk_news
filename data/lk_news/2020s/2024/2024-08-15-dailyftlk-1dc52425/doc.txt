Patali and Rishad to support Sajith

The Ekasath Jana Raja Peramuna (EJRP), led by MP Patali Champika Ranawaka, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) today to support Presidential candidate Sajith Premadasa. The MoU was formalised at the Grand Monarch Hotel, with Patali Champika Ranawaka and party Secretary Bandula Chandarasekara representing EJRP, while Sajith Premadasa and Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara represented the SJB.

Addressing the event, Patali Champika Ranawaka emphasised that the upcoming election is not merely about choosing a President for the next five years but is crucial for determining the country’s direction for the next two decades and the future of its children. He highlighted the pressing issue of national debt, noting that Sri Lanka must pay off its foreign debt by 2039 and local debt by 2042, projecting a looming risk of bankruptcy if not managed properly. Ranawaka stressed that the next five years are critical for securing the future of the nation’s youth.

Presidential candidate Sajith Premadasa outlined his vision for a Government that prioritises talent and competence over favouritism, focusing on scientific skills and expertise. He promised a balanced approach, avoiding extreme capitalism and socialism, and advocating for a humanitarian form of capitalism that ensures fair distribution of wealth. He emphasised the need for social democratic policies to promote humanistic capitalism and equitable wealth distribution.

Additionally, it was announced that All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) leader Rishad Bathiudeen has decided to support Sajith Premadasa’s Presidential bid. Former cricketer T.M. Dilshan is also among those endorsing Premadasa.
