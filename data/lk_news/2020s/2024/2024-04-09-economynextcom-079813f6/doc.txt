Sri Lanka cabinet approves revised electricity reform bill

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet of ministers have approved an revised bill to reform the country’s electricity sector, Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said.

The bill will be published in the government gazette this week and presented to parliament in the last week of April, Wijesekera said in a post of the social media platform X.com (twitter).

The electricity reform bill is linked to a 100 million US dollar budget support loan from the Asian Development bank.

The reform bill envisages a splitting Ceylon Electricity Board in to separate entities.

The first bill was revised amid concerns from stakeholders including lenders.

The public will have two weeks from the day it’s presented to the Parliament to challenge the bill, Minister Wijesekera said.
