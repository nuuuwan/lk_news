Govt. reveals stance on allowing vehicle imports

Minister Vijitha Herath states that the import of vehicles will only be carried out under a proper procedure and in a manner that will not exhaust the foreign reserves in the country thereby causing a dollar crisis again.

Herath also assured that the government is of the stance that the importation of vehicles should be allowed.

“Currently, there is a higher demand to facilitate the import of vehicles. There is a Cabinet decision regarding the matter that was made earlier. But so far, we have neither imported any vehicles after we came into power, nor allowed any vehicle imports with tariff concessions”, he added.

“But regarding the import of vehicles, we are in the stance that we should allow the import of vehicles, but only under a proper procedure”, the Minister said.
