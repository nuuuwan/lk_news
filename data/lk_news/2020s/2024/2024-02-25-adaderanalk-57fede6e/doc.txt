Minister assures ETCA will not be disadvantageous to Sri Lanka

Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabry has assured that signing the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) with India will have no disadvantageous result to Sri Lanka.

Accordingly, the Minister emphasised that trade agreements with the global market must be established if Sri Lanka’s economy is to be built and strengthened, and highlighted that the country’s economy cannot be further boosted in the absence of an export-based economy.

India has expressed hopes for the early conclusion of the ETCA, which seeks to add to the existing free trade agreement with Sri Lanka, to pave the way to boost the island’s export potential.

The 14th round of negotiations between Sri Lanka and India on the ETCA are scheduled to be held in New Delhi, in the first week of March 2024.
