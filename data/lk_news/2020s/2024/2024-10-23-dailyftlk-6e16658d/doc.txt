Ranil named as respondent in FRs filed over crackdown on 2022 SYU protest

The Supreme Court granted permission yesterday for former President Ranil Wickremesinghe to be named as a respondent in the fundamental rights petitions filed against the Police for attacking and dispersing a protest organised by the Socialist Youth Union (SYU) in 2022.

The decision was made after the Court considered a request from the petitioners’ legal team during the hearing of two petitions brought forward by members of the SYU. These petitions were called before the Supreme Court yesterday.

The incident took place in September 2022, when the SYU organised a protest against Wickremesinghe under the theme, “Rulers who destroyed the dreams of youth, withdraw the oppression! Resign immediately!”

The Police brutally cracked down on the peaceful protest march, resulting in the arrest of 85 persons including Bhikkhus and lawyers. Of those arrested, 61 were held at the Maradana Police Station, while the remaining 24 were detained at the Slave Island Police Station. Among those arrested were SYU Nationl Organiser Eranga Gunasekara, Koswatte Mahanama Thera, and National People’s Power (NPP) member Wimal Katapearachchi.
