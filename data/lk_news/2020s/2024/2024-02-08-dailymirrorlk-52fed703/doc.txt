Cabinet nod to import up to 15,000 tonnes of cashew nuts this year

The Cabinet nod has been given to import up to 15,000 tonnes of cashew nuts in shell this year, as the cashew harvest halved to 12,500 tonnes.

Although the country’s annual cashew nut demand is estimated at 25,000 tonnes, the Government Information Department noted that currently only 12,500 tonnes of cashew nuts can be procured locally.

“... the cashew industry in the country facing a very unfortunate situation, as the crop has not been harvested as expected in the last season,”

Accordingly, Agriculture and Plantation Industries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera this week sought the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers to import a maximum of 15,000 cashew nuts in shell this year and to import a quantity determined by the committee consisting of senior officials of the relevant ministries, from December to April, when local cashew is not available in the next four years.

The cashew season in the country usually begins in March and continues through April.
