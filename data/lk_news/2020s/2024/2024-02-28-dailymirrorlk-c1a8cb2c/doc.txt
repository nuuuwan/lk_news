2.4 mn family units to receive ’Aswasuma’ in second phase: Minister

Colombo, Feb. 28 (Daily Mirror)- All necessary arrangements have been made to extend benefits in the second phase of the "Aswasuma" programme to 2.4 million family units, starting from June 2024, Finance State Minister Shehan Semasinghe said.

The State Minister underscored the imminent closure of the second phase of the applications, slated to conclude on March 15, 2024.

Emphasizing the importance of timely submission, he reiterated that individuals failing to submit their applications by the given deadline will forfeit eligibility for benefits associated with the programme.

He said this during a media briefing at the Presidential Media Centre today (28), themed 'Collective Path to a Stable Country'.

Minister Semasinghe said that approximately 7,000 individuals who were found to have received benefits based on false information have been removed from the programme due to appeals and objections.

He said 3.4 million family units were certified for the programme's first phase. Out of this, 1.9 million families have been deemed eligible to receive benefits.

"Following the assessment of appeals and objections received, the Welfare Benefit Board is prepared to commence payments to the selected beneficiaries from July 2024.

A total of 1,227,000 appeals and objections were registered, of which around 1,197,000 have been resolved. Furthermore, there is a group of deserving individuals who did not receive welfare benefits because they did not submit their application forms during the initial application period.

"Following extensive online awareness efforts, we have received approximately 200,000 to 250,000 applications so far. The application forms handed in directly to the Divisional Secretariats are currently being processed through our online system. The call for applications in the second phase will conclude after March 15, 2024. It's crucial to note that failure to submit application forms renders individuals ineligible for relief benefits," he said.
