Dilith says ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ alliance aims to build a brave and strong opposition

Leader of the ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ alliance and Gampaha District candidate, entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera, stated that a brave and strong opposition can only be established by the ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ alliance.

He made these remarks at a public meeting held in Kurunegala.

“The ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ alliance was formed with a vision. We wanted to safeguard our patriotism which is escaping from us. We are embarking on a strategic political journey. We approach this political journey with bravery and courage,” he said.

He further noted that in this election, they are not contesting to become the Prime Minister, rather, they are aiming to establish a brave opposition. Jayaweera said they are committed to forming an opposition that will acknowledge what is right and what is wrong and halt actions that are incorrect.

He questioned as to what can be achieved in this country by making Sajith Premadasa the leader of the opposition again.

“This ‘medal’ is the emblem of the nation’s trust that hangs around the neck of the people,” he added.
