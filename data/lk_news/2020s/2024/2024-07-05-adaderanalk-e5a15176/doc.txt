CCD Inspector and Constable arrested while accepting bribe

An Inspector of Police and a Constable attached to the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) have been arrested by officers of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) while accepting a bribe of over Rs. 150,000.

The Bribery Commission stated that the two suspects, who were apprehended inside the CCD premises in Dematagoda, had solicited a sum of Rs. 450,000 as a bribe and were apprehended while accepting the final payment of over Rs. 150,000 out of that.

A resident of the Ibbagamuwa area of Kurunegala has lodged a complaint with the CCD in relation to a fraudulent money transfer through an online business of exchanging the electronic currency called ‘USDT’.

The two suspected cops had allegedly stated to the complainant that two suspects connected to the incident were arrested and produced before the court. However, they have demanded a bribe of Rs. 454,200 to refrain from arresting the complainant as well.

The individual in question has initially provided an amount of Rs. 300,000 to the two cops as the first payment of the bribe, the CIABOC said, adding that the duo were arrested while obtaining the remaining Rs. 154,200.

The arrested police officers will be produced before Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court, the Bribery Commission added.
