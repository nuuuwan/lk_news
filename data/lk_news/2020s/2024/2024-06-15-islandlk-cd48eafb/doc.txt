SLT-MOBITEL & STEMUP Educational Foundation successfully complete first batch of “CoderDojo”

Empowering youth with essential coding skills for the digital future, SLT-MOBITEL, the National ICT Solutions Provider, in collaboration with the STEMUP Educational Foundation and the National Library of Sri Lanka, has successfully completed the first batch of CoderDojo program at the Public Library premises in Colombo.

This initiative, led by STEMUP Educational Foundation, powered by SLT-MOBITEL and strategically partnered with the National Library of Sri Lanka, underscores SLT-MOBITEL’s commitment to nurturing the next generation of innovators and tech-savvy leaders. The successful completion of the first batch of CoderDojo at the Public Library demonstrates the company’s dedication to providing equal opportunities for all students to acquire invaluable STEM education skills.

Offered free of charge, the program aims to cultivate an interest in coding and ICT among students, equipping them with essential skills for the digital age. Initially, the CoderDojo programs were conducted at three SLT-MOBITEL Nebula Technology Institutes located in Welisara, Moratuwa, and Peradeniya. Recognizing the immense potential and demand, the program has now been extended to public libraries across Colombo, Batticaloa, Kirimatiyana, Hanguranketha, Doluwa, Galle, Hakmana, Kurunegala, Nochchiyagama, Badulla, Ratnapura, and Kuliyapitiya, making it accessible to a broader range of students.

The comprehensive 12-month curriculum was delivered by dedicated STEMUP volunteers who guided and mentored young learners through the intricacies of coding and ICT. These passionate mentors played a vital role in creating an environment of curiosity, creativity, and hands-on learning, inspiring students to explore the boundless possibilities of technology.

The CoderDojo program not only introduces students to the fundamentals of coding but also encourages the development of critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaborative skills essential for success in the 21st century. By fostering these abilities from an early age, SLT-MOBITEL is empowering the youth to become active contributors to Sri Lanka’s digital transformation.
