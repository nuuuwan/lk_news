Govt. to provide free sanitary napkins to schoolgirls annually

The government has decided to provide free-of-charge sanitary napkins to schoolgirls starting this month.

At its meeting on Monday (01), the Cabinet of Ministers green-lighted a proposal presented by Education Minister Susil Premajayantha to carry out the program annually.

Thereby, as many as 800,000 schoolgirls from rural schools, remote schools, estate schools, and urban schools with poverty-stricken students, will thus be provided with sanitary napkins free of charge.

According to the government, out of Sri Lankanâ€™s student population, which amounts to approximately 4 million, a total of 1.2 million are menstruating schoolgirls.
