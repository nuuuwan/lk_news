Sri Lanka to allow import of 750 vans and 250 buses for tourism

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will import 750 electric and hybrid vans with 6–15 seating capacity, 250 buses with 6–30 seating capacity, and 30–45 seating capacity without any special tax relief, for transportation of tourists.

“As a result of import restrictions on vehicles and essential spare parts, the state of many vehicles used in the tourist industry are not of a satisfactory level,” Cabinet spokesman Bandula Gunawardena said.

“The use of outdated vehicles for tourist transportation is damaging Sri Lanka’s reputation as a premier tourist destination.”

Providing modern transportation facilities for an accelerated development in the tourism industry was essential, the minister said “considering the contribution of the tourist industry within the economic revival process of Sri Lanka”.

“Although it is considered a custom within the industry that vehicles used for tourist transportation would not be used for more than 6 years, it is apparent that the condition of the vehicles used here are not satisfactory.” (Colombo/Apr2/2024)
