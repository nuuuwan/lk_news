“Making investments not only for generating profits but also for the wellbeing of the motherland is a unique feature of our institution. Therefore, we consider that contributing to the preservation of natural resources, including, flora and fauna, rivers, and waterfalls and fostering a country enriched with all essentials for our younger generations, the backbone of our country, is our corporate responsibility. It goes hand in hand with the main principles of the Bank: saving and thrift,” NSB said.
