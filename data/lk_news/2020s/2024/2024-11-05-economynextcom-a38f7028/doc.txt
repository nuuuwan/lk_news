Sri Lanka’s EDB forms task force to address exporters issues

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Export Development Board has established a trade facilitation task force to address challenges in the export value chain and increase export efficiency.

The task force comprises representatives from 35 public sector organizations directly involved in facilitating cross-border trade.

“Its main objective is to identify operational issues and develop solutions to the obstacles faced by exporters, aiming to address these challenges in the shortest possible time,” the EDB said in a statement.

“Through this initiative, the EDB seeks to foster cooperation between institutions to streamline trade processes, improve export efficiency, and support the country’s economic growth.”

By reducing trade barriers and enhancing inter-agency collaboration, the task force will enable exporters to boost their competitiveness in global markets, the EDB said.

This collaborative effort is expected to provide exporters with better access to information, resources, and solutions to optimize their operations, ultimately generating greater export income for the country.

The first meeting was held last week at the Export Development Board attended by EDB Director General Champika D Dharmasena, Additional Director General (Development) Anoma Premathilaka, Project Director of the Trade National Single Window System Project Neelakanth Vanninayake, officials from public institutions nominated to the task force, EDB directors and officers.
