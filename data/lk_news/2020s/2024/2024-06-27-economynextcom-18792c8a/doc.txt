Sri Lanka stocks close down, profit taking seen

ECONOMYNEXT – The Colombo Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, data on its site showed.

The broader All Share Index closed down 0.59 percent, or 72.43 points, at 12,188; while the more liquid S&P SL20 Index closed down 0.75 percent, or 27.26 points, at 3,601.

“There’s a lack of confidence among investors due to the uncertainty created around the ISBs,” market participants said.

Clearing activity usually seen around the month end could also have been a factor for the indices to close down, Softlogic Stockbrokers said. “Market sentiment was subdued despite the positive news on the economic front yesterday.

“These being the last trade days of the month and a lot of clearing and margin calls taking place could be one reason for market to close down.

“And there was also some profit taking seen. There was a lot of selling, predominantly by local participants.”

Sunshine Holdings Plc (down at 63.90) saw the most active volumes traded in the day.

With the exception of Amana Bank Plc, which closed up at 2.30, all other banking stocks closed down or flat. (Colombo/Jun27/2024)
