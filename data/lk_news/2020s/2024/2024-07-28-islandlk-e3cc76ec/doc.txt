Another phase of the “SANASA Way Forward” programme series, conceived by the leader of the SANASA Group, Dr. P.A. Kiriwandeniya, was successfully held on 18 and 19 July at the Tilco Hotel in Jaffna. The event was attended by representatives from all the political parties in the area. The chief guest, Parliamentarian Angajan Ramanathan, along with public and private sector representatives, participated in the proceedings. On the first day, politicians, civil servants, and private sector stakeholders were introduced to the concept of “SANASA Way Forward”. The second day focused on informing the general public, a crucial group for driving a productive economy, about the initiative. Approximately 500 SANASA members and non-members attended the event, where Dr. Kiriwandeniya provided a detailed introduction to the structure of “SANASA Way Forward”.

Addressing the attendees, Dr. Kiriwandeniya shared his vision for “SANASA Way Forward”, a concept designed to foster a manufacturing-based economy that transcends the limitations of a service-oriented model. He explained that this initiative, which spans from the leadership of the SANASA Group to ordinary citizens, aims to address the country’s economic challenges by embracing a more productive economic model. He emphasised that through collective effort and unity, Sri Lankans of all ethnic backgrounds, be they Sinhala, Tamil, or Muslim, can work together to build a brighter future for the nation.
