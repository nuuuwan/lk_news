Ex-soldiers joining Russian military as mercenaries, Sri Lanka seeks details

Amidst reports that some ex-military men from Sri Lanka have joined the Russian military operations against Ukraine, Sri Lankan Ambassador in Moscow Prof. Janita Liyanage said she asked for details about them from the Russian military if any. She said this in response to a query about media reports to that effect. “I sought such details from the Russian military if there is anyone there,” she said.

Asked for a comment, Media Director of the Defence Ministry Colonel Nalin Herath said some ex-soldiers might have joined the Russian military, possibly through unlawful means. He said the Ministry had taken steps to educate soldiers about the dangers involved in such unlawful acts.

“They might have been lured through lucrative offers. What is the guarantee for compensation in case any of them dies in fighting,” he said.
