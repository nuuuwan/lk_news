Cathay Pacific re-commences flight operations to Sri Lanka

Colombo, Feb 2 (Daily Mirror) - Scheduled flight operations by Cathay Pacific Airways were resumed with the inaugural flight, CX 611, which arrived at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) last night, the Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Limited said.

They said the airline recommenced passenger flight operations using an Airbus 330-300 aircraft, and the days of operation will be Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.

Cathay Pacific has been catering to the Sri Lankan market for over 30 years. The airline temporarily stopped flight operations in March 2020 due to the global Covid 19 pandemic situation.

However, the airline operated a Boeing 747 freighter carrying vital supplies, including Covid vaccines, during the pandemic.

The inaugural flight carried 253 passengers and they were welcomed by a cultural dancing performance organized by Sri Lanka Tourism at the BIA.

As an airline that currently operates to around 80 destinations in the world, AASL is pleased to see the resumption of flight operations by such reputed international airlines, AASL said.
