EDEX Expo 2024: Sri Lanka’s largest education fair returns for its 20th edition

The EDEX Expo 2024, Sri Lanka’s largest education fair, is scheduled to take place from Feb 9 to 11 at the Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Center in Colombo and on Feb 17 and 18 at the Kandy City Center in Kandy. The event aims to provide insights into opportunities in higher education, training, gainful employment, and entrepreneurship for the youth of Sri Lanka.

Addressing a press conference held at the Royal College Union Skills Centre in Colombo last Wednesday, Nadun Hettiarachchi, Project Chairman of EDEX Expo 2024, described the event as a catalyst for change. He emphasized, “The EDEX Expo is more than just an education fair; it is a catalyst for change. With the climate clock, we aim to spark conversations, ignite curiosity, and inspire young people to become agents of positive change in the face of the climate crisis.”

The Expo brings together top-tier local and international universities and higher education institutions, offering a centralized location for students to explore a wide range of higher education choices. This facilitates a swift and convenient method for students to identify the most suitable qualifications for their desired career path. Additionally, many institutions featured at the expo will provide opportunities for partial or full scholarships, including exclusive offers available only through the EDEX Expo.

A significant focus at the EDEX Expo 2024 will be on Sri Lanka’s first-ever climate clock, a monumental installation by EDEX Think Green, the sustainability arm of the EDEX initiative. More than just a timepiece, it serves as a clarion call to action for Sri Lanka and the world.

Kasun Kosgahakumbura, Director of the EDEX Job Fair, stated, “The Job fair will open a window of opportunity for participants to interact with prospective employers and look for employment most suited to their ambitions and qualifications.”
