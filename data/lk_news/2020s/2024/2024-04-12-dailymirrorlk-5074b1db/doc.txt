SLPP to take disciplinary action against GL, others

Colombo, April 12 (Daily Mirror) - The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is to take disciplinary action against MP Prof. G.L. Peiris and others who have signed an agreement with the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB).

These MPs were elected to Parliament on the SLPP ticket. Later, they defected from the party and sat in opposition. A week ago, they signed an electoral pact with the main opposition, the SJB.

The SLPP, at its executive committee meeting, decided to initiate disciplinary action against them for signing an agreement with another party while being members elected on its ticket at the last election.
