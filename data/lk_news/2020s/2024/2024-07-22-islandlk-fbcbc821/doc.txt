NDB Bank in collaboration with Suwaseriya Foundation refurbishes Hikkaduwa ambulance

NDB Bank contributed to a worthy ‘National Cause’ that will benefit the people of this nation by joining hands with the ‘1990 Suwaseriya Foundation’ to ‘Adopt an Ambulance’. The adopted and refurbished ambulance was branded with the NDB logo and officially redeployed from NDB Head Office at Nawam Mawatha to Hikkaduwa, underscoring NDB’s on-going commitment to supporting community-driven initiatives while ensuring timely medical assistance. The NDB-branded ambulance will operate in the Hikkaduwa area for one year, providing critical emergency services to communities in need.

The refurbishment of the ambulance with the NDB logo is not just a symbolic gesture; it represents the Bank’s unwavering commitment to the well-being of Sri Lankan citizens. By supporting the operational costs of this ambulance for a year, NDB ensures that vital emergency medical services remain accessible to all, particularly in areas facing economic challenges.

Kelum Edirisinghe, NDB Director/CEO, expressed his enthusiasm for this partnership, stating, “As a socially responsible entity, NDB is honoured to collaborate with the 1990 Suwaseriya Foundation in supporting this national cause. We believe that everyone deserves access to emergency pre-hospital medical services, and this initiative reflects our dedication to contributing to the well-being of our fellow citizens.”

Adding to this sentiment, Sohan De Silva, CEO of the Suweseriya Foundation, commented, “Our partnership with NDB Bank is a significant step towards ensuring that emergency pre-hospital medical services are accessible to those who need them the most. The support from the Bank enables us to continue our mission of providing timely and efficient care.”

The 1990 Suwaseriya Foundation has been instrumental in delivering free pre-hospital care and ambulance services across the island. This collaboration with NDB Bank highlights the foundation’s on-going efforts to provide timely and efficient emergency care, particularly amidst the current economic difficulties.

As the NDB-branded ambulance begins its operations in Hikkaduwa, NDB Bank continues to champion initiatives that bring positive change to communities and contribute to the overall well-being of the Sri Lankan people. This project is a vital component of NDB’s broader strategy to support and uplift the nation through impactful community engagements and sustainable initiatives.
