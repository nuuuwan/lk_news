Two women stuck between two moving compartments

Colombo, April 26 (Daily Mirror) - Two women were trapped between two compartments this evening while trying to board a moving train before it stopped, the Railways Department said.

They said the accident occurred at around 4:35 p.m. as the Kandy-bound Colombo train was arriving at the Colombo Fort station, where it was supposed to stop for passengers to board.

Both women sustained serious injuries and were taken to the hospital for treatment, they said.

A major rescue effort ensued, with bystanders and railway employees at the Fort station working together to free the women from between the train compartments, the Department said.
