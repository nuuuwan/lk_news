Keheliya and 7 others further remanded

Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and 7 others have been further remanded until 20 May by the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court over the import of substandard human immunoglobulin vials.

This order was issued when the relevant case was taken up before the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court today (06).

Meanwhile, one of the suspects who was arrested and remanded in connection with the case was released on bail today.

Accordingly, the former Deputy Director of Medical Supplies Division of the Health Ministry, Dr. Thusitha Sudarshana has been released on bail.

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Rambukwella on 02 February in connection with the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), when he arrived there, complying with a court order. He had been grilled for nearly 10 hours before being arrested.

The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker.

Prior to the apprehension of Rambukwella, seven arrests had been made in connection with the drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail. As such, the former Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministry’s Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, now remain in remand custody.
