Showery conditions expected to continue further

Due to the low-level atmospheric disturbance in the vicinity of Sri Lanka, showery conditions are expected to continue further, the Meteorology Department said.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places in most provinces of the island after 1.00 p.m.

Heavy showers of about 100mm are likely at some places in Western, Central, Sabaragamuwa and Uva provinces.

Showers may occur in Western and Southern coastal areas during the morning too, it said.

General public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
