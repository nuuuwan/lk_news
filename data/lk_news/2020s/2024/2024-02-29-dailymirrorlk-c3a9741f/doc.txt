Deshabandu defends his actions during ’Aragalaya’

Colombo, Feb 29 (Daily Mirror) - While defending his actions during the 'Aragalaya' period, newly appointed IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon today emphasized that if not for their actions, the current situation could have been significantly different.

He also asserted that during the Aragalaya, he faced criticism and accusations, but maintained that he diligently carried out his responsibilities for the Sri Lanka Police.

"During the 'Aragalaya' period, anyone could point a finger and accuse me, criticizing my conduct. However, I executed my duties to the best of my ability during that time for the Sri Lanka Police. The situation could have been vastly different today if we hadn't acted in the manner we did. As the Senior DIG in charge of the Western Province at that time, I merely fulfilled my duties to protect the country's democracy and national security," he said.

While assuming duties at the Police Headquarters, the IGP said that he hopes to implement a comprehensive transformation in the department by creating the environment that needs to improve the skills of the police officers.

"My primary objective was to eradicate organized crime and curb narcotics trafficking in the country. To achieve this goal, I intend to make a massive transformation in the police department, creating opportunities for talented officers at junior levels to reach leadership positions," he added.
