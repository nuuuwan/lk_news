US Assistant Secretary Donald Lu embarks on visit to Sri Lanka

U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, Donald Lu, has commenced his official visit to Sri Lanka today (13).

Accordingly, he is set to engage with officials from across the political spectrum and civil society to deepen the United States’ partnership with Sri Lanka.

Mr. Donald Lu’s Sri Lanka visit came as part of his broader tour of the region from May 10th to 15th, which included India and Bangladesh.

Issuing a statement, the US State Department stated last week that in his meetings, he will reaffirm the United States’ support for Sri Lanka’s economic recovery, as well as the importance of a robust civil society as a cornerstone of a free and democratic society.
