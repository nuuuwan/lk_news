World Bank to host roundtable on Advancing Energy Transition in Colombo

Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera announced yesterday that the World Bank will organise a roundtable discussion on Advancing Energy Transition on May 29 in Colombo.

Minister Wijesekera, via a post on X, noted that a preliminary discussion about the event took place last week with the World Bank team at the Ministry of Power and Energy.

“The program will focus on attracting investments in the renewable energy sector, accelerating energy transition, green hydrogen programs, and scaling up private investments,” the Minister added.

He also noted that the event will see the participation of energy and financial experts from development agencies, industry stakeholders, and officials from the relevant ministries.

The roundtable is part of broader efforts to foster investment and innovation in renewable energy, ensuring a greener and more resilient energy future for the country.
