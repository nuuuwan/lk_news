More opposition parties to support NCM against Speaker

More political parties in the opposition have expressed their support for the no-confidence motion brought forward by the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) against Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena.

Accordingly, the National People’s Power (NPP) party, Supreme Lanka Coalition (SLC) and Freedom People’s Congress (FPC) yesterday expressed their support for the no-confidence motion.

MP Udaya Gammanpila confirmed the SLC’s support for the move, while MP Dullas Alahapperuma, the party leader, announced the FPC’s decision.

NPP MP Harini Amarasuriya informed the media yesterday that their party has decided to support the motion as well.

Meanwhile, Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leader Sivagnanam Shritharan said that while the TNA is yet to announce their decision, the party will convene to deliberate on the matter soon.

The no-confidence motion brought forward by the SJB alleges that the Speaker violated both the constitution and Parliamentary privileges of Members of Parliament by endorsing the Online Safety Act, which they claim was not properly passed in parliament.

The signing of the motion began on Monday as Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, MP M.A. Sumanthiran, Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kieirella, Professor G. L. Peiris, Tissa Attanayake, Chandima Weerakkody, Shan Wijayalal de Silva, and others signed the motion on behalf of the SJB and Samagi Jana Alliance.
