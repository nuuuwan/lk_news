Sri Lanka expects more jobs in Romania, amid concerns of job scams

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is planning on providing new jobs for Sri Lankans in Romania, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ali Sabry, said amid concerns that some job agencies were misleading migrant workers.

“In Romania, there are 40,000 Sri Lankans there,” Sabry told reporters Thursday. “It is a big market for Sri Lanka.

“We are looking at improving further opportunities in Romania for the Sri Lankans as well as for Romanian tourists to come to Sri Lanka.”

Sabry visited Romania in July 2024 and met with government officials.

However, there are reports that some workers are being misled by job agencies with the promised job not being given, despite paying fees of 3,500 US dollars or more.

“We continuously advise Sri Lankans that please do not go seeking employment on visit visas,” Sabry said. “You need to get your work visas and get your contract.”

Qatar-based Al Jazeera, said in an online report that some Sri Lankans who have been recruited to as housekeepers have ended up as kitchen helpers in restaurants with poor living conditions and others are working in food delivery after being promised other jobs.

With higher living standards, the Eastern European nation has seen reduced demand from domestic workers for jobs seen as difficult. (Colombo/Aug03/2024)
