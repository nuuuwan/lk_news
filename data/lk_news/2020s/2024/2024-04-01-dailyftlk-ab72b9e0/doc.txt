With this strategic alliance in place, the reach of Supreme Media gets expanded to more than double across Sri Lanka, allowing it to connect with a broader spectrum of audience to deliver its unique, premium variety of content and fulfil its inspiring brand commitment.

This monumental partnership further extends into the radio domain, with TNL’s Radio channels at 89.1 and 89.3 MHz undergoing a rebranding as ‘Supreme’ with the same inspiring brand message – Mage Handa Mage Rata.

This move not only enhances Supreme Media’s ability to connect with a wider audience through multiple media forms but also signifies its formal arrival as a media network, with offerings that include two TV channels, One radio channel, and three distinct digital channels.
