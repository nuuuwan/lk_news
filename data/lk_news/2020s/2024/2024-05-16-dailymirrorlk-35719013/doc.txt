ICFS offers affordable path to European masterâ€™s degree in Malta under Schengen visa

Colombo, May 16 (Daily Mirror) - The International Centre for Foreign Studies (ICFS) has introduced an opportunity for students aspiring to pursue a master's degree in Europe for 1.8 million LKR.

Chathurika Dissanayake, the CEO of ICFS Education Center said that this initiative, facilitated under a Schengen Visa, opens doors to academic excellence in Malta, one of Europe's vibrant countries.

The program, offered by ICFS Education Center, allows applicants to secure a master's degree in Europe at a reasonable cost.

She said that students can be sponsored by individuals with the financial capacity to support their education. "Malta further sweetens the deal by reimbursing 70% of the tuition fees for students who remain in the country for 1.5 years post-graduation, contributing to its economy," she said.

Under the Schengen Visa, students gain unrestricted access to travel across European countries, broadening their cultural experiences and networking opportunities. While dependents cannot initially accompany applicants, there are pathways available to bring them over after six months of residency in Malta, provided income criteria are met, the CEO said.

There are also part time work rights as well as post study work visa available and applicants are able to work on their permanent Residency pathways in Europe after graduation. ICFS Education invites all eligible candidates to visit our center in Nugegoda on May 18th, between 10.00 am and 5.00 pm.

She said this event offers candidates a chance to interact with university representatives from Malta to explore more about the study options.
