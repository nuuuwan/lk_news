Colombo, April 04 (Daily Mirror) -  The Maligakanda Magistrate's Court today ordered the CID to investigate into the credibility of former President Maithripala Sirisena's controversial revelation regarding the Easter Sunday attacks.

Magistrate Lochani Abeywickrema ordered the CID that the progress of the investigation regarding this revelation be submitted to court on May 10.

The CID had filed a facts report before Maligakanda Magistrate's Court regarding the statement the former President had made recently. Minister of Public Security Tiran Alas had instructed the Inspector General of Police to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the statement made by the former President in Kandy that he knew the people involved in the Easter Sunday bomb attacks on 21 April 2019.
