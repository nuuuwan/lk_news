Sri Lanka Port City duty free shopping complex in legal quagmire

ECONOMYNEXT – Duty free concessions given by Sri Lanka’s Colombo Port City Commission to operate duty free shops in a special economic zone would have to be reversed, as they had no legal basis, former chairman of the parliament’s Committee on Public Finance said.

There was to be a 5,000 US dollar allowance for returning Sri Lankans and foreigners any amount, according to concessions gazetted on May 29.

Sri Lanka the parliament has control of public finance, and changing taxes by gazette notice, a type of prerogative power, has been questioned.

“The Port City Commission listed up 200-300 items that would be made duty free, to be sold at -the new downtown duty-free complex, which should also have a 25 percent tax holiday, in addition to being duty free,” opposition legislator Harsha de Silva, who was chairman of the parliament’s Committee on Public Fiannce told an economic forum organized by Colombo-based Advocata Institute.

“So, my question to the Commission was, who gave you the power to make this legislation?”

The response was that there was authority for the Commission to make rules.

“And later we found out, we read the rules and the rules referred to community rules,” de Silva explained I said in that that case, its something asking you to stick to a dress code if you are to come to my club, which is not something you have to exclude yourself from taxes.

But several businesses had signed up to run duty free shops on the tax breaks that were announced leaving a problem that has to be now resolved, de Silva said.

Sri Lanka has a habit of changing import duties my minister’s prerogative through several laws including CESS and PAL, which are called para-tariffs which adds to the uncertain policy environment in the country.

Tax breaks given through a Strategic Development Project Law which also has sweeping discretionary powers has been questioned. (Colombo/Feb01/2023)
