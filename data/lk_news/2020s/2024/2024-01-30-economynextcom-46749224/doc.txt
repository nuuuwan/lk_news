Sri Lanka mulls exporting Hambantota port rocks

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet had given the nod to appoint a committee which will look into the feasibility of exporting up to a million tonnes of granite including a stockpile of rocks dug up when building the Hambantota port, Minister Bandula Gunawardana said.

The rocks are now piled up in the port premises near the administration building and by the Hambantota New Hospital, he said.

“A committee will be appointed to study the possibility of exporting one million metric tons of granite,” Cabinet Spokesperson, Bandula Gunawardena said.

The exports will be carried out under the supervision of Sri Lanka’s Geological Survery and Mines Bureau.

Sri Lanka’s construction industry is also in depressed condition amid an economic crisis and 50,000 and livelihoods of 50,000 workers in the quarry sector have been hit and there is reduced domestic demand according to a cabinet proposal submitted by Environment Minister Keheliya Rambukwelle, he said.

The committee will look into the matter and produce a report for the cabinet. (Colombo/Jan29/2023)
