Ex-Health Minister Keheliya and 3 others further remanded

Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and 03 other suspects, implicated in the alleged importation of substandard human immunoglobulin vials, have been further remanded until August 29.

The order was issued after the defendants were produced before the Maligakanda Magistrateâ€™s Court today (22).

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Rambukwella on 02 February over his alleged complicity in the procurement of substandard IVIG vials.

Accordingly, the former Minister of Health is currently in remand custody in connection with his alleged complicity in the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) vials.

The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker.

In October 2023, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests.
