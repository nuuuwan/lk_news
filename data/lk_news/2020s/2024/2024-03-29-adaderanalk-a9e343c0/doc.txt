Trains on Coastal Line facing delays until March 31

The railway operations on the Coastal Line are experiencing delays on Friday (29), Saturday (30) and Sunday (31), the Department of Railways said.

The department attributed the delays to the railway operations being limited to a single track between Wellawatte and Colombo Fort railway stations due to a pipeline maintenance activity carried out by the Urban Development Authority (UDA).

However, the train operations on the Coastal Line will be restored after Sunday night (31), according to the Department of Railways.
