YJA highlights media industry job losses at May Day rally

Young Journalists Association (YJA) General Secretary M. H. M Fazeer yesterday claimed that over 1000 journalists and media personnel have lost their jobs in the recent past due to the economic crisis.

Speaking at a May Day rally in Colombo, Fazeer criticised the Government and media owners for neglecting to safeguard media workers, noting that as a consequence, over 1000 individuals have lost their jobs in recent years. He noted the absence of adequate provisions and programs for the well-being of journalists, emphasising the concerning lack of recognition given by institutions to correspondents operating outside of Colombo. In his address, Fazeer stressed the importance of creating an environment conducive to the free and uninhibited work of journalists and media personnel. He called for concerted efforts to ensure that these individuals receive adequate livelihood support and are afforded their rights within the media landscape. Fazeer also called for collective efforts to secure media rights.
