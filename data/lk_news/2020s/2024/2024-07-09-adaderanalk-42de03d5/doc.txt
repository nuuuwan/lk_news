Special increments and commendation certificates for non-striking employees

Non-executive government employees, who reported for duty on July 8 and 9, 2024, will be granted a special salary increment as a token of appreciation for their dedication during a challenging economic period. This increment was approved by the Cabinet following President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s proposal, the President’s Media Division (PMD) said.

Accordingly, the Secretary of the Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils, and Local Government has been directed to inform all Ministry Secretaries, Department Heads, and Provincial Chief Secretaries and to issue the relevant circulars.

Certain trade unions in non-executive services had planned actions such as sick leave and strikes on the mentioned dates. Despite previous economic instability, the government managed to stabilize the situation through extensive economic reforms implemented over the last two years, including the provision of a monthly allowance of Rs. 10,000 to all public servants.

The Treasury Secretary highlighted the existing financial constraints, stating that further salary or allowance increases would not be feasible without imposing additional tax burdens on the public. The government remains committed to avoiding decisions that could worsen the financial strain on citizens already facing economic challenges.

Nonetheless, the government acknowledges its responsibility to recognize and assess non-executive officials who fulfilled their duties without resorting to disruptive measures during this critical period, it added.

Accordingly, instructions will be issued in a circular to all Ministry Secretaries, Department Heads, and Provincial Chief Secretaries in the presence of the Secretary of the Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils, and Local Government, according to the PMD.

Over 200 public sector trade unions affiliated with the State and Provincial Public Service Unions Collective launched a trade union action to report ‘sick leave’ yesterday (08) and today (09) demanding an allowance of Rs. 25,000 for all public sector employees, similar to that given for executive officers.

Accordingly, government officials across several sectors did not show up for work yesterday leading to a significant disruption in the daily operations of these institutions including the Department of Registration of Persons and Immigration Department.

In support of this action, the postal workers began a strike action last Sunday (07). The co-convener of the United Postal Trade Unions’ Front Chinthaka Bandara mentioned that their strike will continue until midnight today. Meanwhile, the teacher-principal trade unions have also decided to report ‘sick’ today.
