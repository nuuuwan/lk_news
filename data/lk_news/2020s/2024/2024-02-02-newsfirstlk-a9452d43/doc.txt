Colombo (News 1st) â€“ A huge blast rocked the Kenyan capital Nairobi close to midnight Thursday, as a truck carrying gas exploded, killing two and injuring over 200, destroying houses, apartments, shops and vehicles, foreign media said.

The explosion took place at 11:30 p.m. local time in the Embakasi district, sending thousands of people fleeing in terror from the flames. The death toll could rise.

Government spokesman Isaac Mwaura said "Kenyans are hereby advised to keep off the cordoned area in order to allow the rescue mission to be carried out with minimal disruptions".

The Kenya Red Cross said on social media that crews had been "tirelessly battling the flames".
