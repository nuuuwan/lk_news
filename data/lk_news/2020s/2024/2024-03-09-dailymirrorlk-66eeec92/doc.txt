First elephant breeding ground, hospital opened in Habarana

The first private elephant breeding ground and hospital for domesticated elephants was opened on Thursday in the Habarana area.

This project has been initiated according to a concept of S.N. Roshan of Maharagama, the owner of the female elephant “Sita” who was shot at during the Mahiyangana Esala festival by a member of the Civil Defence Force.

The convalescent female elephant Sita and another tusker had been brought to the opening ceremony of the hospital and breeding ground where the first breeding took place.

A traditional owner of elephants Roshan said facilities were available at the hospital and the breeding center to train mahouts. He pointed out that his she elephant Sita survived due to the efforts of the veterinary surgeons at Peradeniya Veterinary Science Faculty.

He said a shortage of domesticated elephants for religious and cultural ceremonies has been felt and that it is imperative that particular attention should be paid on protecting the available domestic elephants.
