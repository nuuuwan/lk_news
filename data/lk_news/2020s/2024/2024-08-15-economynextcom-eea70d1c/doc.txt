20 Sri Lankans rescued from Myanmar cybercriminal operations

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has been able to arrange the release of twenty Sri Lankans who were stranded in a human trafficking scheme in Myanmar, its Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.

The Sri Lanka Missions in Yangon and Bangkok worked to ensure their safe release, and they are now in Mae Sot, Thailand, the ministry said in a statement.

“All the rescued Sri Lankans are in good health, and Thai authorities are facilitating Consular assistance,” the ministry said.

The Sri Lankan Embassy in Bangkok is coordinating with Thai authorities to repatriate them.

These Sri Lankans traveled to Myanmar seeking foreign employment using tourist visas, and were lured into cybercriminal operations and became victims of human trafficking.

“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs urges the public to be cautious and to adhere to the proper procedures when pursuing employment opportunities abroad, so as not to fall victim to human trafficking.”

The Ministry said it was working through the Sri Lankan Missions in Yangon and Bangkok to rescue the remaining 34 Sri Lankans stranded in the Myawaddy area of Myanmar, with the support of the relevant governments.
