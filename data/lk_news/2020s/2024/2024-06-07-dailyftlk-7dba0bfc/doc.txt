Release of book ‘Talking to My Daughter – A Brief History of Capitalism’ in Sinhala

A Sinhala translation of the book ‘Talking to My Daughter - A Brief History of Capitalism’ written by the famous economist, political activist, and former Finance Minister of Greece, Yanis Varoufakis, and published by the Revolutionary Students’ Union, was released on Sunday.

University students, academics, artists, and representatives of trade unions and mass organisations, participated in this event, which was held at the Colombo National Library Auditorium.

The Frontline Socialist Party Education Secretary Pubudu Jayagoda, academics Dr. Kalpa Rajapaksha and Sumith Chaaminda, and the Revolutionary Students’ Union Organising Secretary Mangala Maddumage, shared some initial thoughts. This was then followed by an open discussion with participants.

This book is a timely contribution to building public discourse and debate on the ongoing economic crisis, impact of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program on the public, and the false assurances related to the economy, that’s presented to the people by current leaders and some economists. It is particularly noteworthy that the author of this book, Yanis Varoufakis, was the Finance Minister of the Government formed in Greece in 2015. Greece, much like Sri Lanka, has suffered a serious economic collapse – and so this book has been written based on his experience.
