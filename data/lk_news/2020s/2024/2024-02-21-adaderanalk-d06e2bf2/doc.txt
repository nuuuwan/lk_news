Power Minister explains how electricity tariffs will be reduced

The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is to submit a proposal to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) to reduce the electricity tariffs that were increased last October, according to Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera.

Speaking in Parliament today (21), the minister said that the proposal is expected to be submitted by the CEB to the PUCSL tomorrow.

He stated that in October last year, the electricity tariffs had been increased by 18% for domestic and religious places of worship, by 12% for industries and hotels and by 24% for government institutions.

Minister Wijesekera stated that the CEB expects to reduce the rates by at least the same rates and percentages as was increased in October 2023.

He explained that they are able to propose such a reduction in view of the country’s economy turning towards the better, as a result of certain difficult decisions that had to be taken in the past.

“These changes were possible because of the difficult and unpopular decisions taken in the past. We saw the difference in the country’s economy through this data, so we have decided to use this same data, and give the maximum possible benefit to the public”, he said in this regard.
