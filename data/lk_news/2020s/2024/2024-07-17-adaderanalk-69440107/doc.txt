Diana Gamage withdraws petition against SJB decision

Former Minister of State Diana Gamage has withdrawn her petition from the Supreme Court today (17), which was filed seeking an order to annul the decision taken by the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) to remove her from the partyâ€™s National List.

When the petition was taken up today (17), the attorneys appearing on behalf of Diana Gamage informed the court that there was no need to continue with the petition and therefore requested the court to allow its withdrawal.

Accordingly, the Supreme Court granted permission for the petition to be withdrawn.
