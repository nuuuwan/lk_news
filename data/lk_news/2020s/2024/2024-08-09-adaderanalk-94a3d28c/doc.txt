A discussion has been held at the Election Commission regarding the security measures to be implemented on the day of the accepting of nominations for the 2024 Presidential Election.

The meeting was attended by senior police officers from the Colombo District and officials from the Election Commission.

Meanwhile, a workshop on the enforcement of election laws and media guidelines took place at the Department of Government Information this morning (09).

Deputy Election Commissioner (Electoral Dispute Resolution) Piyumi Atigala stated that numerous complaints have been received related to social media. As a result, special attention is being given to social media during the election period, she said.

“We are focusing particularly on Instagram and TikTok. We are in direct contact with these companies. If they do not comply with the regulations and orders issued by us regarding social media, they have indicated their willingness to go beyond the usual conventions and support us”, she said.
