Sri Lanka Police try humour to get message across social media

ECONOMYNEXT – The Sri Lanka Police are trying humour across social media platforms to get their message across to the public.

The official X (twitter) page of Sri-Lanka Police features a series of tweets with popular culture references.

One such message warns about being vigilant, another cautions against riding a motorbike without a helmet, and a third on phishing scams.

The island nation’s Police have come under criticism for its drastic measures in a special anti-drug operation called ‘Yukthiya’ (justice) to nab the drug distributors across the country.

The UN Human Rights Commission early this year said it was “very concerned that authorities in Sri Lanka” were “adopting a heavily security-based response to the country’s drugs problem, instead of public health policies grounded in human rights”.

Sri Lanka’s Inspector General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon has vowed to increase resources and cadres in its ‘fight against drugs and crimes’ even by closing some unproductive divisions if required. Fortunately this does not seem to have affected their online team. (Colombo/Jun7/2024)
