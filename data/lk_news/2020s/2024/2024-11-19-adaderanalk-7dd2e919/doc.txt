Lohan Ratwatte’s bail request moved to December

The Court of Appeal has granted time for the Attorney General (AG) to fie objections related to the petition filed by former State Minister Lohan Ratwatte requesting him to be released on bail.

The petition was taken up for consideration before the two-member Appeals Court judge bench consisting of the President of the Court of Appeal Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Shashi Mahendran today (19).

During the trial, the Additional Solicitor General who appeared on behalf of the AG requested a period of 4 weeks to file objections related to the petition.

Appearing for Ratwatte, President’s Counsel Sanjay Rajarathna, who objected the Additional Solicitor General’s request, asked the court for a short date to be given for the purpose.

Accordingly, the court which ordered the AG’s Department to file objections before November 29, ordered the petition to be recalled on December 9.
