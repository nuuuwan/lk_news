Semasinghe urges Opposition to ditch unrealistic election promises

State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe called on the Opposition to abandon impractical election promises, asserting the need for responsible discourse focused on the country’s future rather than personal political gains.

Speaking yesterday, he highlighted the potential risks of reversing crucial economic reforms at a time when Sri Lanka is recovering through challenging yet necessary measures.

“We are now on the right track, implementing very difficult economic reforms and this is a time to think about the future of the country rather than personal political goals. The reversal of these reforms could lead to a significant uncertainty about the country’s future,” he warned.

Semasinghe asserted that Sri Lanka is progressing through globally recognised methods, adhering to positive and realistic economic policies.

“I urge all political actors to prioritise the country’s long-term stability and prosperity over short-term political ambitions,” he added.

The State Minister noted that the Government, under the leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, is committed to transparency and responsibility in its governance.

“The Government is engaging in a responsible discourse and we are fulfilling our responsibilities more transparently,” he said.
