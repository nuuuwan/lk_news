Police launch probe as Inspector flees country citing death threats

Colombo, Feb 28 (Daily Mirror) - Police have launched an investigation into Police Inspector Duminda Jayathilaka, the Officer In-Charge of the Organized Crime Division at the Colombo Crimes Division, who has left the country due to death threats from members of underworld gangs, targeting him and his family.

Inspector Duminda Jayathilaka reportedly left for France on February 14 from the Bandaranaike International Airport, accompanied by personal security guards, as a precaution against the threats looming over him and his family. Among the gangsters who allegedly threatened him are Kanjipani Imran and Heenatiyana Mahesh.

Inspector Jayathilaka made several statements to the media from aboard the plane about the threats he had allegedly received from criminals.

Police spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa said there is reasonable doubt and suspicion about all the incidents and that police suspect the Inspector may have tried to seek benefits or advantages.

It was reported that the threats against the officer escalated following the arrest of suspects involved in the poisoning of two suspects at the Aduruppu Veediya police station. Following multiple arrests during this probe, he had reportedly received numerous death threats.

The spokesman said the officer had not disclosed to senior officers that he had received death threats from underworld criminals lately. However, he said once the officer had informed about such threats the Colombo Crimes Division had provided Inspector Duminda Jayathilaka with an official firearm for his protection.

Despite this measure, he opted to leave for France ensuring the safety of his wife and seven-year-old daughter in a secure location within the country.

It was reported that Inspector Jayathilaka was instrumental in arresting several homicide suspects last year.

Inspector Jayathilaka was also involved in investigating into an attempted escape by 'Harak Kata' from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). During the investigations, numerous suspects associated with the incident were arrested.

Spokesman DIG Thalduwa said the officer obtained leave from February 14 to March 6 and that if he does not return for duty before March 6, police will consider him as having vacated his post.
