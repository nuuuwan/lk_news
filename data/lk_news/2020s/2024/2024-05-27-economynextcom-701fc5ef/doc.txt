“Exit Offer of Sri Lanka Rupees Six (LKR 6) per share, made by Advantis Projects & Engineering (Private) Limited (“Majority Shareholder”) to the rest of the Shareholders of Unisyst Engineering Plc (the “Company”) who may wish to sell their shares in the Company,” the Hayleys Group said in a stock exchange filing.

The Company would focus on residential projects, “developing standard products to be marketed locally and for exports. Performance is also expected to be driven by the materialization of several medium-to-large scale projects for which the Company has already submitted bids.” (Colombo/May27/2024)
