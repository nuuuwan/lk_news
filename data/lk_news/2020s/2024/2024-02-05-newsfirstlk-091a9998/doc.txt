Sri Lanka Crush Afghanistan by 10 Wickets in Colombo Test!

COLOMBO (News 1st): Sri Lanka beat Afghanistan by 10 wickets to win the only test match between the two nations, in Colombo.

Afghanistan, batting first, were bundled out for a modest 198 runs. Opening batsman Rahmat Shah top-scored with a fighting 91, but the Sri Lankan bowling attack, led by the pace of Vishwa Fernando (4 wickets) and the spin of Asitha Fernando and Prabath Jayasuriya (3 wickets each), proved too strong.

In reply, Sri Lanka piled on a mammoth 439 runs, building a commanding lead. Veteran Angelo Mathews anchored the innings with a masterful 141, while Dinesh Chandimal provided valuable support with a fluent 107. Opener Dimuth Karunaratne also chipped in with a solid 77. Despite Naveed Zadran's four-wicket haul for Afghanistan, the Sri Lankan batting line-up proved too deep and diverse.

Set an improbable target of 443, Afghanistan could only manage 296 in their second innings. While young Ibrahim Zadran impressed with a fighting 114 and Rahmat Shah continued his good form with a brisk 54, the Sri Lankan bowling attack maintained their stranglehold.

Chasing 56 runs to win, Sri Lanka reached target in less than 10 overs, winning the game by 10 wickets and a day to spare.
