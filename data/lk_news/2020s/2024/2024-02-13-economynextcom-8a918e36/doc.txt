Sri Lanka to lease plantation lands to export-related businesses

ECONOMYNEXT – Lands held by the State will be provided on a long-term lease to businesses with a focus on export activities, the Cabinet spokesman has said.

“Large underutilized lands are to be given on long-term lease basis to investors with the potential to grow exportable crops, raise livestock farms for export and produce other exportable goods and services,” Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at a press briefing to announce Cabinet decisions on Tuesday (13).

A large amount of land owned by government plantation agencies such as the Janatha Estate Development Board and the Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation has remained without cultivation or productive use for a long time due to various reasons such as legal problems, institutional conflicts, lack of capital etc, Gunawardena said.

“A plantation reform program has been prepared by the Non-Cabinet Minister of State Plantation Enterprise Reform to effectively utilize the such lands in a way that will bring multiple benefits to the society by involving local entrepreneurs.” (Colombo/Feb13/2024)
