Japan trains Sri Lanka Coast Guard on oil spill response

ECONOMYNEXT – The Japan Coast Guard (JCG) has trained 37 officers of the Sri Lanka Coast Guard (SLCG) on how to handle oil spills, with help from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).

“The establishment of a sustainable human resource development system to address oil spill incident in SLCG is an important initiative for Sri Lanka and Indo-Pacific region,” JICA said in a statement.

Five experts of the JCG comprising two officials from their Mobile Cooperation Team specialized in capacity development, two officers from National Strike Team Station in Yokohama who are in charge of oil spill management in a coastal area in Japan, and one officer from Marine Environment Protection and Disaster prevention Division of JCG conducted the oil spill response training from February 5-22.

The onshore training in Kirinda was held from February 6-12, and offshore training in Dikovita from 14-21. “In the final part of the training, SLCG patrol vessel 501 and 502, which is provided through JICA Grant Assistance in 2018, were used to conduct a comprehensive drill simulating an oil spill incident, utilizing oil fences and other equipment.”

Since the inception of this series of technical cooperation in 2014, more than 200 SLCG officers have joined the training program, JICA said. (Colombo/Feb29/2024)
