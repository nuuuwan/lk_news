Complete MEP services by Hayleys Fentons for Vallibel Finance new corporate office in Colombo 03

Vallibel Finance’s new corporate office in Colombo 3 stands tall as a symbol of innovation and efficiency, thanks to the expertise of Hayleys Fentons, Sri Lanka’s premier MEP contractor. Spanning 16 floors on a 42-perch plot, this cutting-edge building boasts state-of-the-art MEP installations for a new 110,000-square-foot corporate space.

This project by Hayleys Fentons was successfully completed by providing specialised installations, such as a modern Fire Protection and Detection System, and integrating cutting-edge technology for the building’s Chiller Management System (CMS).

Safety takes centre stage with Hayleys Fentons’ installation of a sophisticated Fire Protection and Detection System. Programmable with addressability features, this system ensures precise fire location detection, facilitating swift evacuation in emergencies. Seamlessly integrated with the fireman intercom and PA system, all controlled from a single panel, this setup promises utmost safety and efficiency.

Sisira Weerabahu, Executive Director at Vallibel Finance PLC says, “We commend Hayleys Fentons expertise and collaborative approach, which ensured a smooth project execution, even amidst challenges like the fast-track schedule, limited material storage space on-site and external constraints. We believe the MEP systems will foster a comfortable, efficient, and productive work environment.”
