Some MPs harassing us due to our stand on VFS issue: Harin, Harsha

Parliament, June 07 (Daily Mirror) The issue pertaining to obtaining the services of VFS Global for the process of granting Sri Lankan visas to foreigners has taken a new turn with Minister Harin Fernando and MP Harsha de Silva complaining that some MPs have told them not to oppose the project and not to probe the scam.

“An MP has said that I have become silent on the VFS Global issue after accepting a bribe. This is not true. I have not become silent. I am opposing it continuously,” Minister Fernando told Parliament.

“I challenged this move in the Cabinet and was able to get some of the visa fees reduced. However, I had to carry out my duty of maintaining the collective responsibility,” he said.

Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa who also joined the crosstalk in the House said Dr. de Silva has been subjected to death threats by some MPs if he continues to probe the visa issue.

Dr. de Silva who clarified this said the MPs did not directly threaten him with death but had asked him to stop the probe by COPF.

"They did not directly threaten me with death. I am however worried that my life will be harmed. What if  I am killed on the street?” he questioned.
