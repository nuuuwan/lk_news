SriLankan Airlines clarifies UL 470 flight delay

Colombo, March 21 (Daily Mirror) - In the wake of the incident where SriLankan Airlines Flight UL 470, scheduled for Incheon, South Korea, faced an unexpected delay on March 19, the Airlines has issued a statement regarding the incident.

The statement said the delay, attributed to a technical issue, lasted approximately 13 hours from the originally planned departure time. However, the Airlines ensured the comfort and convenience of all 217 passengers on board.

“Out of the 217 passengers, 117 opted to continue their journey on the same flight once the aircraft received clearance for departure.  At 07:23hrs the following day, 20 March 2024, Flight UL 470 successfully departed for Incheon, South Korea, accommodating those passengers who chose to proceed with their travel plans,” the statement added.

“For the remaining 100 passengers, primarily migrant workers bound for South Korea, SriLankan Airlines took proactive steps to minimize disruption. Collaborating with the Human Resources Development Service of Korea (HRD Korea) and the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment, the airline rebooked these passengers for a flight on Sunday, 24th March 2024. Importantly, this rescheduling ensures that their employment commitments in South Korea remain unaffected by the delay,” it added.

The SriLankan Airlines also expressed regret for any inconvenience caused by the delay of Flight UL 470 on 19th March 2024.
