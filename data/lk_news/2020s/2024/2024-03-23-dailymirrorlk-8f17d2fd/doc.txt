General Election will be held if MPs want: Presidential Advisor

Colombo, March 23 (Daily Mirror) - A General Election will be held if the members of Parliament want an early dissolution of Parliament, Senior Presidential Advisor Ashu Marasinghe said yesterday.

“A General Election could be held if the MPs adopt a resolution calling for the dissolution of Parliament,” Professor Marasinghe said in response to a question raised by the journalists on the reports which said former Minister Basil Rajapaksa and President Ranil Wickremesinghe had come to an agreement on elections.

“Only a Presidential Election could be held within this year legally while there is more time for a General Election. A resolution has to be passed calling for the dissolution of Parliament if an early General Election is to be held. One wonders whether MPs would adopt a resolution,” he said.

Also, Professor Marasinghe said it is important for Sri Lanka to maintain its present status of the economy. “Sri Lanka's economy has begun to come back and this status has to be continued,” he said. Sri Lanka’s primary account balance was minus Rs 885 billion in 2022 . There has been a turnaround as primary account balance has become plus Rs 51 billion as of December 31, 2023,” he said.
