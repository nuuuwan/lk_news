Thermal power generation increased to 57%: CEB Engineers’ Union

Colombo, Feb 06 (Daily Mirror) -  With the advent of dry weather conditions and insufficient rainfall in hydro catchment areas, thermal power generation has risen to 57 percent, leading to a reduction in hydropower generation, the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers' Union (CEBEU) said.

The union told the Daily Mirror that the water capcity of reservoirs were initially at full, reaching 100 percent. However, with the commencement of dry weather conditions, the water capacity has now decreased to 87 percent.

Accordingly, thermal power generation accounted for 56.7 percent, with 45 percent of this generated through the use of fuel, while the remaining power generation was attributed to furnace oil.

Additionally, the Lakvijaya Power Station, commonly referred to as the Noracholai Power Station, plays a crucial role in contributing to Sri Lanka's overall electricity production, generating a substantial 900 MW.
