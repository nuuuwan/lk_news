Motorcycle used in Ahungalla shooting found torched

A torched motorcycle, which is suspected to have been used in the recent shooting incident in Ahungalla has been recovered in a private land in the Sudu Welipotha area in Kosgoda, police said.

The owner of the land had noticed the burnt motorcycle and informed the Kosgoda Police regarding the matter this morning (10).

In response, Kosgoda Police, along with the Elpitiya Crimes Unit, have initiated an investigation into the recovery.

The shooting incident, which resulted in the death of a 54-year-old individual, occurred in Ahungalla on Thursday (09). The assailants, who had arrived on a motorcycle at around 7.40 p.m., had called the victim out of his residence before opening fire at him.

The deceased individual has been identified as the father of an individual known by the alias “Baba,” a suspect implicated in various murders and criminal cases within the Southern Province. Therefore, police suspect the killing could be linked to the ongoing gang war between two underworld gangs in the south led by notorious figures known as “Kosgoda Sujee” and “Rathgama Vidura.”

However, police have also revealed that the deceased individual had no prior convictions or a criminal record.
