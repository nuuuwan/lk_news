Wijeyadasa to contest upcoming presidential election?

Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe says he has received several requests urging him to run for president in the upcoming election.

Speaking to the media, the lawmaker revealed that the majority of these requests came from the members of the Central Committee of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). Additionally, religious leaders including the Maha Sangha have sought the same, he said further.

Rajapakshe said that he would take into account these requests and arrive at a final decision in the coming weeks.

When asked if he intends to run for president independently, the minister said, “People have no trust in any of the political parties in the country. So, the upcoming election will be very different, and crucial. People do not cast their votes for the political party anymore, they vote for the individual who contest [the election].”
