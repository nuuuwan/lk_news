Sri Lankan pianist at luxury resort

Shahen Thilakaratne is a professional pianist, music producer, music educator, and entrepreneur with an unusual musical gift: at the age of five he could play the piano/keyboards fluently, by ear. It was his mother, he says, who who urged him to do Classical piano exams.

After he completed his education, at Isipathana College, Colombo, he was trained by maestro Sri Lankan pianist Harsha Makalande, a highly respected musician in the scene here.

Recently, Shahen got an invitation to perform in the Maldives, at Cheval Blanc Randheli – a French five-star luxury private island resort, in the northwest of the Maldives, managed by Louis Vuitton.

He was given the opportunity to perform for the festive season by the hotel management.

This resort has been visited by many A-list celebrities, including Demi Lovato, John Legend and Deepika Padukone.

Shahen performed as a solo pianist at the resorts premium restaurants, mainly the Le 1947, Deelani, and Diptyque.

“This was my second visit to Cheval Blanc Randheli, as the resident pianist, and it was truly a memorable experience,” Shahen stated.

Shahen works as a freelancer pianist, doing weddings and other events in Colombo.

He is now getting ready for his ATCL Recital diploma, in Classical piano, guided by Shihan Chamba.
