First Lady calls for humanized foreign ties

At a time where it is repeatedly stressed that Sri Lanka needs to work closely with other nations, First lady Maithree Wickremesinghe called for diplomatic ties which would become connections of hearts, minds and souls.

Ms. Wickremesinghe highlighted this point at the swearing in of US Peace Corps volunteers in Colombo.

“The character of a nation consist not only of its geography and climate, origin, dominant culture, contemporary leaders in politics but also the caliber of its people and connections made by those people, the connections of the hearts, minds, souls especially in an era when connectivity and reality is valued at the expense of human contacts, what would be more real and tangible or human,” she said.

Ms. Wickremesinghe also called for digital whelm for the people of this nation while highlighting that it would be an opportunity for individual education achievement and mobility as well as a general drive for Sri Lankans for economic prospects.

“Though English is functioning as a link language and education is provided in Sinhala and Tamil as pointed out by Minister Preamajayantha, it is also important to hold a digital whelm for the people of this nation as it would be an opportunity for individual education achievement and mobility as well as a general drive for Sri Lankans for economic prospect,” she said.

Minister of Education Susil Premajayantha said his Ministry will seek the support of the US Peace Corps for enhancing the language skills of Sri Lankan children.

US Ambassador in Sri Lanka Julie Chung said Sri Lankans are fiends of the US.

“Sri Lanka and USA are friends. Be a part of the Sri Lankan community and learn from Sri Lankans,” she told the US Peace Corp members.
