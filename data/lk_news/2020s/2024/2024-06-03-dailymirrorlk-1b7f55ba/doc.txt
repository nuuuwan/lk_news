ICC Men's T-20 WC: South Africa beat Sri Lanka by 6 wickets on tricky New York pitch

The South African pacer picks up the award for his fantastic figures of 4-7.

Shanaka is making a notable impact with his bowling, maintaining a disciplined line and length.

The loss of two early wickets and a dramatic last over has put some pressure on the Proteas.

They are, still, under control of this match, chasing a lowly 78.

Sri Lanka appealed for a strangle down leg side against Stubbs. Initially called a wide, they decided to review the decision.

Thushara's over yields 9 runs, including a six from Aiden Markram, as South Africa continues their chase. 23/1 for (4 overs)

Mathews excels in bowling here, concluding his second over with just one run conceded after delivering five consecutive dot balls. SA 14/1 (3 overs)

The toss is coming up soon, so stay tuned for the latest updates!

Today, two cricketing powerhouses go head-to-head in what promises to be an exhilarating match. Sri Lanka, known for their explosive batting and crafty spin bowling, will take on South Africa, a team renowned for their all-round strength and resilience.

Since the start of 2023, South Africa have struggled in T20Is, losing nine of the 11 matches they have completed. Their most recent outing saw them suffer a 3-0 series defeat against the West Indies. However, there have been bright spots in franchise cricket—most notably, Heinrich Klaasen, who hammered 479 runs at a strike rate of 171 in the IPL.

Sri Lanka, on the other hand, come into this match with momentum, having won their last three T20I series in a row. A decade after their T20 World Cup triumph, they boast a potent bowling attack. Their pace arsenal includes Pathirana, Dilshan Madushanka, and Dushmantha Chameera, all capable of breaching 145 kph. Furthermore, Nuwan Thushara’s recent 5 for 20 performance in a T20I highlights their depth. Complementing their pace attack are spinners Maheesh Theekshana and captain Wanindu Hasaranga, adding a formidable spin dimension.
