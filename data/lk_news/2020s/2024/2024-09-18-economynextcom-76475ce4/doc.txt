Sri Lanka in third round of discussions with bondholders: President

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is in a third round of discussions with bondholders, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said, as the country heads for Presidential polls on Saturday.

Sri Lanka has discussed with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and 18 bilateral creditor nations, he said.

“Now we are talking for the final time with private bondholders,” President Wikremesinghe said during a speech where he opened a vehicle assembly plant.

Sri Lanka has conducted two rounds of direct negotiations with bondholders which led to a preliminary agreement on so-called macro-linked bonds and a governance linked bonds.

The final agreement is still to be reached. Wickremesinghe said there was now talk of re-negotiating agreements.

“Some people are saying they will change them,” Wickremesinghe said.

“Then the co-operation we get and the money we get we will lose.”
