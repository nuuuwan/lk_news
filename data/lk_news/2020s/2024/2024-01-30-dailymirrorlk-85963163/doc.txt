Three Parliament employees arrested in for molesting female staff member

Colombo, Jan 30 (Daily Mirror) - A group of employees were arrested today by the police attached to the Women's and Children's Bureau for allegedly abusing a fellow female staff member.

Serjeant-at-Arms Narendra Fernando told the Daily Mirror that the staff members were arrested a short while ago.

“We have already interdicted these staff members as they were found guilty during an inquiry,” he said.

He said there is no necessity for the police to seek the approval of the Speaker before arresting a staff member as in the case of an MP.
