Sri Lanka legislators go to Court against IVS-VFS Global visa deal

ECONOMYNEXT – An opposition legislator said he had petitioned Sri Lanka’s Supreme Court against contract given without competitive tender to private consortium involving companies called IVS-GBS and VFS Global.

Opposition legislator Patali Ranawaka said in an x.com (twitter) post that he had filed action in the Supreme Court with fellow parliamentarians M A Sumanthiran and Rauf Hakeem against the Minister of Public Security and the government alleging a scam over the visa deal.

The Committee on Public Finance in Sri Lanka’s parliament in a report has called for the cancellation or amendment of the visa deal which was struck without competitive tender where foreigners are charged between 10 to 25 dollars to issue a visa.

The tourism industry associations have said the website is difficult to navigate compared to an earlier one run by Sri Lanka’s Mobitel for 1 dollar per visa and it is putting off visitors.

Sri Lanka’s cabinet has seemingly lost its powers to issue free of charge visas unlike competitors in East Asia due to the website. (Colombo/July25/2024)
