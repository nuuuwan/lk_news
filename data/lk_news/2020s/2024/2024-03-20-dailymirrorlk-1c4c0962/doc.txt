Sri Lanka to host Asia Rugby Division 1 in Colombo

Mar. 20 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka Rugby (SLR) is set to host the Asia Rugby Division 1 Championship in Colombo from April 28 to May 5 between hosts Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Qatar.

However, the participation of Pakistan is still in doubt due to political uncertainty. This tournament was confirmed by Asia Rugby recently.

If Pakistan pulls out, SLR will likely host the event with two matches against the Qatar outfit and the venue for the tournament probably, will be the Racecourse Grounds in Colombo.

Meanwhile, CR and FC and Royal College Head Coach, Dushantha Lewke is tipped to be in charge of the Sri Lanka outfit.

The Asia Rugby Top Four is fought between Hong Kong, South Korea, Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

The losers will be demoted to Division 1 in 2025 while the winners in Colombo during the Division 1 encounters this year will get their berth booked for the top four in 2025 which will see three home matches and an equal number of matches away.

The Asia Rugby Top Four: Hong Kong, UAE, South Korea and Malaysia. Asia Division 1: Sri Lanka, Qatar and Pakistan.
