Train delays expected on main line

The Railway Department says that several office trains operating on the main line this evening could be delayed.

Speaking to the media, Deputy General Manager of Railways Mr. N.J. Indipolage stated that certain trains could experience delays owing to railway tracks being inundated in certain areas between Gampaha and Weyangoda.

He further said that the train delays are caused due to the presence of water on the railway track, causing hindrances to the railway signals.

Accordingly, the Deputy General Manager of Railways further mentioned that trains playing towards areas such as Rambukkana, Polgahawela, Kandy, Kurunegala and Mahawa could also be delayed.
