CC unanimously approves new Attorney General appointment

The Constitutional Council has unanimously approved the nomination of Senior Additional Solicitor General Parinda Ranasinghe as the Attorney General.

Senior Additional Solicitor General Parinda Ranasinghe took oaths as the Acting Attorney General before the Chief Justice on July 01, after the proposal to extend former Attorney General Sanjay Rajaratnam’s term by another 06 months was defeated for the second time at the Constitutional Council meeting.

However, the appointment sparked controversy, as allegations were leveled against the government claiming that the new appointment overlooked Senior Additional Solicitor General Ayesha Jinasena, despite her seniority and eligibility for the role, due to gender bias.

However, in response to the relevant allegations, President’s Secretary Saman Ekanayake emphasized that there is no constitutional requirement to appoint the senior-most officer from the Attorney General’s Department to this position based on seniority.

He also expressed that the President is constitutionally empowered, under Article 41C of the Constitution, to appoint the Attorney General with the approval of the Constitutional Council.
