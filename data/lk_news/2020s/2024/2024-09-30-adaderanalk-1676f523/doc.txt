Former MPs informed to handover firearms

Former Members of Parliament (MPs) have been informed to immediately hand over the firearms issued to them to the Ministry of Defense.

The Parliament Members’ Services Division has notified the former MPs of this.

Necessary steps will be taken to send the relevant letters to the former MPs immediately, a spokesman for the division told Ada Derana.

All the facilities provided to the MPs were withdrawn with the dissolution of the Parliament.

Accordingly, former MPs will no longer receive their MP’s allowance, staff allowances, fuel provisions and stamp duty.

However, they are allowed to continue using the official residences provided to them in the Madiwela Housing Complex until the upcoming election.

The former members who are not re-elected in the General Election are required to hand over their houses the very next day after the election.
