Fairly heavy showers, strong winds expected in parts of the island

The prevailing windy conditions over the island are expected to continue further, due to the active South-west Monsoonal condition, says the Meteorology Department.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in Sabaragamuwa Province and in Kandy and Nuwara-Eliya districts, and fairly heavy showers about 50 mm are likely at some places.

Several spells of showers will occur in Western and North-western provinces and in Galle and Matara districts, it said.

Strong winds of about 50-60 kmph can be expected at times over Western slopes of the central hills and in Northern, North-central and North-western provinces and in Trincomalee, Monaragala and Hambantota districts.

Fairly strong winds about 30-40 kmph can be expected at times elsewhere of the island.
