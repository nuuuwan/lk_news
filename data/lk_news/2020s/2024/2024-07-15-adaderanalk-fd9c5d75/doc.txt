Over 10,000 Sri Lankans return from Kuwait during general amnesty

The Embassy of Sri Lanka in Kuwait said that a total of 10,615 Sri Lankan nationals, who were illegally staying in Kuwait and overstayed their visas, have left the country during the “general amnesty period” declared by the Kuwait government for 2024.

This general amnesty period was declared from March 17 to June 30, 2024 as a result of the discussions held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the State of Kuwait and the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Kuwait.

During that period, “temporary passports” had been issued for them to leave the country based on only a few basic documents.
