TISL launches Presidential Election 2024 watchdog

The Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) has officially launched its 2024 Presidential Election observation program, focusing on the critical issue of public resource misuse.

TISL yesterday outlined the organisation’s extensive efforts to ensure a transparent and fair electoral process, essential for maintaining democratic integrity.

TISL said it has been at the forefront of election monitoring for over two decades, addressing the misuse of public resources — a persistent issue in Sri Lankan elections. Historical data reveals that during the 2019 Presidential election, TISL documented over 100 instances of misuse, including the unauthorised use of Government vehicles and state resources. This misuse led to significant distortions in the electoral playing field and eroded public trust in the process.

TISL National Coordinator – Protecting Public Property and Resources Thushanie Kandilpana, highlighted the severity of the problem: “Misuse of public resources remains a major form of corruption that undermines not just elections but the overall governance structure. In previous elections, resource misuse has led to unfair advantages for certain candidates, undermining the democratic process. We must address this to ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity and to maintain public trust in the electoral system.”

TISL Executive Director Nadishani Perera, outlined the organisation’s approach and challenges: “This year, we are expanding our efforts by deploying over 200 ground-level observers across all electorates. Each observer will use a dedicated app to report instances of resource misuse. One of our primary challenges is the sheer volume of data and the need for timely verification. Despite these challenges, our commitment to ensuring a transparent election process remains strong.”

TISL Senior Program Manager Gowriswaran Kirupairajah, discussed practical aspects of their monitoring efforts: “We have launched a new online platform, www.apesalli.lk , for citizens to report misuse anonymously. This year, we are also utilising a hotline that will operate 24/7 to facilitate immediate reporting. In the past, our platforms have helped uncover significant instances of misuse, and we aim to continue this trend by increasing public engagement and swiftly addressing reported issues.”

TISL’s election monitoring initiative places significant emphasis on public involvement. The organisation’s new platform, www.apesalli.lk , allows citizens to report misuse anonymously and is designed to handle a large volume of reports efficiently. The hotline for immediate action and additional reporting channels are part of TISL’s strategy to ensure comprehensive monitoring.

As the 2024 Presidential election progresses, TISL has made several recommendations to improve the electoral process:

1. Implement stricter enforcement of existing election laws to prevent misuse.

2. Increase monitoring efforts and transparency in the use of public resources.

3. Public officials must resist political pressure to misuse state resources and adhere to constitutional mandates.

Kandilpana warned: “Public officials may face pressure to misuse state resources for campaigns, but they must uphold their duty to protect public resources. Misuse can lead to severe legal consequences, including imprisonment and fines. We urge all officials to resist such pressures and maintain their integrity.”

TISL’s commitment to transparency and accountability is crucial for ensuring that the 2024 Presidential election is conducted fairly. The organisation’s efforts, combined with active public participation, represent a significant step toward safeguarding Sri Lanka’s democratic process.
