Thai Airways resumes daily flights between Bangkok and Colombo

ECONOMYNEXT – The first Thai Airways flight arrived at the Bandaranaike International Airport this morning after operations resumed between Sri Lanka and Thailand.

Thailand’s Thai Airways resumed daily flights to Colombo from April 01, state-run Airport and Aviation Services, which runs the Indian Ocean island’s airports said.

Thai Ambassador to Sri Lanka Paitoon Mahapannaporn, Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva and senior officials of Airports and Aviation Services were present on the occasion.

Sri Lanka has seen an uptick in tourist arrivals, and seeks to boost regional tourism further.

Sri Lanka and Thailand signed a free trade agreement which will allow the two countries to benefit from potential trade and investment that is largely untapped at the moment.

A new bilateral air services agreement was also signed, and Sri Lanka and Thailand are considering visa free travel to strengthen economic links between the two countries. (Colombo/Apr1/2024)
