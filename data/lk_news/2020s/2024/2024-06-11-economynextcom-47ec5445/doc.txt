Sri Lanka drafts patient safety and well-being charter

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has prepared a Charter to ensure patient safety and well-being, compiled by a panel of experts on the advice and guidance of the World Health Organization.

It focuses on institutional standards, stakeholder roles, and alignment with existing strategies to enhance patient safety nationwide, the WHO in Sri Lanka said.

“Sri Lanka is leading the way in initiating the process for a legal framework specifically addressing Patients’ Safety and Wellbeing in a Charter that captures the rights of the patients, and the responsibilities of the health care workers, the government, and the patients,” WHO Sri Lanka said on X (twitter).

If implemented, it would be the first such to ensure the safety and well-being of patients in the South Asian region, Sri Lanka’s parliament said in a statement.

It was prepared by a sub-committee of the Parliamentary sectoral oversight committee on health in consultation with experts.

The Patient Safety and Well-being Charter was handed over by the Chair of the Subcommittee Dr Upul Galappaththi to the Chair of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Health Mayantha Dissanayake at Parliament.

Minister of Health Dr Ramesh Pathirana, State Minister for Health Dr Seetha Arambepola, and World Health Organization representative Dr Alaka Singh, were present on the occasion. (Colombo/Jun11/2024)
