Sri Lanka disconnected power customers about 12,000 a day: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has on average about 12,000 electricity customers who are without electricity after being disconnected for not paying bills, and not a million or hundreds of thousands as claimed, Power Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said.

“There was a picture painted that one million electricity customers were in the dark,” Minister Wijesekera said.

“But when a connection is disconnected a person will get the connection back in a day or two. Sometimes in an hour two.There has never been a case where hundreds of thousands of houses (laksha ganan) being in the dark.

“I checked recently how many customers were in the dark after being disconnected. On average it is less than 12,000 daily.

The CEB has to collect money to pay for generation and keep the utility going he said.

In January 2024, Minister Wijesekera told parliament that 965,566 disconnections were made by the CEB on  its 7,018,785 customers and 98,834 by Lanka Electricity Company on its customer base 620,238, which was an increase over the previous year.

However, he said there were occasions where electricity was disconnected for arrears which were not very big and that was unfair. Therefore instructions had been given to change it.

There have been data also released earlier of a slightly higher number of inactive accounts where owners are abroad or buildings are closed.

The bill for 1.8 million subscribers who were using the lowest amount of electricity the bill was about 280 rupees for one month supply of electricity, he said.

“That is less than one dollar. The dollar is 306, rupees. Where in the world is that done?,” he said. We have been able to do it due to the process we have followed.” (Colombo/July21/2024)
