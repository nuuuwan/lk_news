University non-academic staff to intensify their strike action

The Joint Committee of University Trade Unions says they have decided to further intensify their strike action due to delays in addressing their demands.

Co-Chairman of the Joint Committee of University Trade Unions Dhammika S. Priyantha stated that the association unanimously agreed to withdraw from all voluntary services within universities. This includes halting the supply of water and electricity, as well as discontinuing internet facilities. These disruptions will significantly impact various operations within the university system, he said.

“Also, the authorities should take full responsibility for the destruction of samples maintained at the laboratory level in the university system. This kind of thing is happening to the university system because of the actions of this government. If the administration continues to avoid it, we should also rethink about the activities that we voluntarily carry out in the university,” said Priyantha.

Senior Professor Sampath Amaratunge, chairman of the University Grants Commission, urged all employees to prioritize their work and focus on educating students.
