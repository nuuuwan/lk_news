“Investors are confident that the NPP will get a simple majority, so there is no worry of a stable government,” a dealer said.

“What is more critical is the IMF deal. Any bad news on that front will reverse sentiment.”

Completing the external debt restructuring is also key to completing the IMF review.

Following statements by President Dissanayake on completing the debt restructuring and negotiations with the IMF there were more positive expectations, another market participant said.

On the rupee, market participants are waiting for any impact on opening of vehicle imports next year.

Once the external debt restructuring is complete, there will also be interest service coming in, which will also be watched, a dealer said. (Colombo/Nov13/2024)
