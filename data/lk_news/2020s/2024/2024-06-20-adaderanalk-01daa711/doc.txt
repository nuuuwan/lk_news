Indian Foreign Minister Jaishankar arrives in Sri Lanka

Indian External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar has arrived in Sri Lanka on an official visit, a short while ago.

He was welcomed at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake by Sri Lanka’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya and the Governor of Eastern Province Senthil Thondaman.

“Look forward to my meetings with the leadership. Sri Lanka is central to our Neighborhood First and SAGAR policies,” Jaishankar posted on ‘X’ following his arrival in the island.

During the visit, the Indian foreign minister is scheduled to have meetings with the leadership of Sri Lanka on wide-ranging issues of the partnership, the Indian High Commission in Colombo said.

This is Jaishankar’s first bilateral visit after the formation of the new Government under Indian Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.

“Reaffirming India’s Neighbourhood First Policy, the visit underlines India’s continued commitment to Sri Lanka as its closest maritime neighbour and time tested friend,” the High Commission said.

The visit will add momentum to connectivity projects and other mutually beneficial cooperation across sectors, the statement added.

During a recent meeting with President Ranil Wickremesinghe in India, Dr. Jaishankar addressed the swift resumption of development projects initiated in Sri Lanka with Indian investments, which had been halted midway.

He also had expressed his intent to visit Sri Lanka to oversee the progress of these activities.

Minister Jaishankar had assured that he would visit Sri Lanka soon to coordinate the Indian Prime Minister’s visit and expedite the commencement of development projects funded by Indian investments.

Jaishankar had also noted plans for an industrial zone in Trincomalee, to be established by the Indian government, which will attract numerous Indian investors and potentially investors from other countries.
