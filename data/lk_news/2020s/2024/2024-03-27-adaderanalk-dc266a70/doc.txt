The Health Trade Union Alliance says that 72 health sector trade unions will launch an indefinite strike from 6.30 a.m. on Tuesday (April 02).

Co-convenor of the alliance, Chanaka Dharmawickrama stated that the decision was taken at the leadership committee meeting held today.

He stated that during the talks they held with the Health Secretary on March 18 the latter had requested for 10 days to resolve their issues and that this period comes to an end tomorrow (28).
