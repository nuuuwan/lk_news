The water supply for parts of Colombo will be suspended on Saturday (Feb.10) for a period of 15 hours, the National Water Supply & Drainage Board (NWSDB) says.

Water cut will be in place from 5:00 p.m. tomorrow until 08:00 a.m. on Sunday (Feb.11).

According to the NWSDB, Colombo 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 areas are supposed to be affected by the water cut, which is being imposed due to essential maintenance work planned under the Ambatale Water Supply System Improvements and Energy Saving Project.
