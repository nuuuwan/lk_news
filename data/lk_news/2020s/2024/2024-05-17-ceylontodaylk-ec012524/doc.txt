Rathupaswala shooting: all accused army personnel acquitted

The four accused army personnel in the case of Rathupaswala shooting in 2013 in which three including a school student were killed and nearly 50 persons were injured, were acquitted by the Trial-at-Bar at Gampaha High Court.

Delivering the verdict today (17), the court ordered to acquit the four Sri Lanka army personnel including a Major General and three soldiers as the Attorney General has failed to prove the guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

On 1 August 2013, army personnel opened fire at unarmed villagers at Weliweriya, killing three and injuring about 50 persons, as they protested against a factory which they said polluted their groundwater and demanded clean drinking water.

In August 2019, then Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya appointed a Trial-at-Bar consisting High Court Judges Menaka Wijesundara (President), Nimal Ranaweera and Nishantha Hapuarachchi to hear the Rathupaswala case, after considering the Attorney General’s request.

On 11 September 2019, the Attorney General filed indictments before the Trial-at-Bar at the Gampaha High Court, against then-Brigadier Anura Deshapriya Gunawardena and 3 other military persons for allegedly ordering troops to open fire on protesters demanding clean water in Rathupaswala in 2013.

On April 30, 2024, the Gampaha High Court’s Trial-at-Bar deferred delivering the verdict in the case until today (17).
