PUCSL to announce decision on CEB’s tariff reduction proposal today

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) is slated to deliver its decision on the electricity tariff reduction proposal mooted by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) today (Feb.28).

According to a spokesperson of the Ministry of Power & Energy, the tariffs are likely to be reduced by at least 18%.

PUCSL will convene a meeting later today to decide on the state-owned electricity supplier’s tariff revision proposal which was submitted to the Commission on Feb.22.

Last week, Minister Kanchana Wijesekera told the parliament that the CEB expects to reduce the rates by at least the same rates and percentages increased in October 2023.

In October last year, the electricity tariffs were raised by 18% for domestic and religious places of worship, by 12% for industries and hotels and by 24% for government institutions.
