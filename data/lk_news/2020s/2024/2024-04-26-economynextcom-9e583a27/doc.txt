Sri Lanka’s Mattala Airport to be managed by India, Russia companies

ECONOMYNEXT – Management of Sri Lanka’s southern Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport has been awarded to a Russia and India joint venture, cabinet spokesman Bandula Gunawardena said.

“Five parties submitted Expressions of Interest and the cabinet approved the decision to award it to the Russia-India joint venture on a 30-year contract.”

The companies were named as Shaurya Aeronautics Pvt Ltd of India and Airports of Regions Management Company of Russia.

The China-built airport has struggled to attract regular traffic, even after a raft of special concessions were offered for international airlines operating from the airport, including discounts on landing and parking charges.

The losses of the airport were reduced by 30 percent, Ports and Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva told parliament in December.
