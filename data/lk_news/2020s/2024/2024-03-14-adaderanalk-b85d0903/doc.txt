Application deadline for second phase of ‘Aswasuma’ extended

The deadline to submit applications for the second phase of the “Aswasuma” welfare benefit program has been extended until March 22, 2024, State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe said.

Taking to ‘X’ (formerly Twitter) to announce this, Semasinghe highlighted that so far 130,000 new applications have been received in the system and that more applications which have been handed over physically need to be entered in the data system by the Divisional Secretariats.

The acceptance of applications for the second phase of ‘Aswesuma’ program commenced on February 15. Accordingly, the families that could not submit applications during the first phase or did not participate in the housing information census can apply during the new phase, as earlier announced by the Welfare Benefits Board (WBB).

During the second phase of ‘Aswesuma’, benefits are anticipated to be extended to 2.4 million families.
