Thigambaran accuses Govt. of election tactics in plantation sector wage hike

Urges unions and plantation workers not to fall prey for cheap election tactics

Main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Palani Thigambaram voiced scepticism regarding the recent plantation sector daily wage hike announced by President Ranil Wickremesinghe during the May Day rally, alleging it was another tactic by the Government ahead of elections.

“We have doubts about the sincerity of the wage increase announced. We feel that it is just another tactic and a conspiracy by the Government and the employers of the Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) used to sway voters in the lead-up to elections,” he claimed. Thigambaram asserted that any legal action taken by the RPCs challenging the Government gazette would likely prolong the process, taking at least another two years to reach a final verdict.

“I urge the unions and plantation sector workers not to be deceived by these ‘cheap election tricks’ orchestrated by the Government and RPC employers,” he added.
