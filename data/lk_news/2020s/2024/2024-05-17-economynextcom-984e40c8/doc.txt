Supreme Global says ropes in Malaysia’s MMAG for SriLankan Airlines bid

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Supreme Global says it has roped in Malaysia’s MMAG Aviation Consortium Sdn Bhd (MAC), which has interests in air cargo, for its bid to buy state-run SriLankan Airlines.

“Supreme Global has identified MAC as the ideal partner to guide and support this acquisition, based on MAC’s expertise and recent contracts secured from major carriers like MasKargo and Teleport by AirAsia,” the company said in a statement.

Under the terms of the agreement, MAC will provide freighter aircraft and operational support to establish a cargo feeder network for SriLankan Airlines if Supreme Global and its partners win the bid.

Supreme Global was pre-qualified to conduct due diligence and eventually bid for SriLankan Airlines by Sri Lanka’s State Owned Enterprises Restructuring Unit.

MAC will support Supreme Global and its partner in restructuring efforts post-acquisition, as well as assist in launching a cargo network leveraging the geographic position of Sri Lanka to enhance its capacity as a strategic hub, Supreme Holdings said.
