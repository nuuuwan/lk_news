Sri Lanka closes express highway, tightens security for Iran President’s visit

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has tightened security in capital Colombo and southern districts amid plans to close its key airport express highway on Wednesday for the Iran President Ebrahim Raisi’s short visit to launch Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project.

Raisi will inaugurate the irrigation and hydropower project that was designed and built by Iranian engineering firm. The project was initially financed by Tehran before U.S. sanctions hit the project.

Raisi’s visit comes 10 days after Iran unleashed a barrage of missiles and drones targeting Israel in retaliation for April 1’s suspected Israeli strike on its consulate in Damascus, which killed 13 people.

A special security programme and traffic plan have been in place on Wednesday (24) for President Raisi’s visit, Police Spokesman Nihal Thalduwa said.

The special security plan will be implemented with the support of elite police force and armed forces.

Police Spokesman said the expressway leading to the airport will be closed from 2-3 pm and 9:30-10:30 pm on Wednesday (24) to facilitate the drive of President Raisi.

The security plan also includes closure of many roads in Colombo, Thalduwa said.

President Raisi will arrive in Sri Lanka on Wednesday (24) at 9 am at Mattala airport for the official visit on an invitation by President Ranil Wickremesinghe. (Colombo/April 24/2024)
