Sri Lanka’s boat builders head to Dubai

ECONOMYNEXT – Boat builders in Sri Lanka are headed to the Dubai International Boat show to showcase their capabilities this week.

Dhanusha Marine Lanka Exports (Pvt) Ltd, Neil Fernando and Compnay (Pvt) Ltd, and Northwest Marine Lanka (Pvt) Ltd will participate at the event, held from February 28 to March 3 at Dubai Harbour, UAE.

The boat show brings together manufacturers of superyachts, sailboats, sports boats, fishing boats, and speed boats, as well as equipment manufacturers and other related products and services including diving and fishing, water sports, maritime technology and services.

It’s an opportunity for networking and business opportunities, the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB), said in a statement. “Visitors can explore a diverse range of boats, from small dinghies to luxurious superyachts and witness the latest designs, technologies and innovations in the boating industry.

“The event also highlights the latest advancements in maritime technology, navigation systems, marine equipment and services. Exhibitors and industry experts showcase cutting edge solutions related to propulsion, safety, communication, entertainment and more.”

Sri Lanka is surrounded by the sea, but the island neither has a domestic yacht culture, nor yacht-based tourism activities like liveaboard diving cruises.

The country wants to promote a range of marine-linked tourism activities as well as wider use of yachts including attracting owners to park their luxury yachts in the island, Tourism Minister Harin Fernando said last month. (Colombo/Feb28/2024)
