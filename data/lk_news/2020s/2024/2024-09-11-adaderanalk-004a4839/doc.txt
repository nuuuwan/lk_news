ITAK to take final decision on supporting presidential candidate

The leader of Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) MP Mavai Senathirajah has stated that the final decision as to which candidate the party will support in the upcoming presidential election will be announced on September 15.

ITAK had initially decided on September 01 to support the presidential candidate of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya-led alliance, Sajith Premadasa, as communicated by TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran during a press briefing on the same day. Sumanthiran had pointed out that this decision was reached at the party’s Central Committee meeting.

However, the representatives of ITAK’s Kilinochchi branch had called a special meeting last Monday and unanimously decided to support the Tamil common candidate, P. Ariyanenthiran.

Meanwhile, President Ranil Wickremesinghe had met with ITAK leader Mavai Senathirajah at his residence in Kankasanthurai, Jaffna, on September 07 for a discussion.

Additionally, a special committee meeting of ITAK chaired by Mavai Senathirajah was held in Vavuniya yesterday (10).

Accordingly, it was decided that the final decision as to which presidential candidate the party will support in the presidential election will be announced on September 15, Mavai Senathirajah told Ada Derana.
