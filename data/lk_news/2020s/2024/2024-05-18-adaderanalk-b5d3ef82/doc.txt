Sri Lankan fisherman dead, one missing after trawler collides with ship

One Sri Lankan fisherman has been killed while another is reported missing after a multi-day fishing vessel collided with a ship off Valaichchenai, Trincomalee.

Five fishermen had left the Valaichchenai fisheries harbor on May 12 for a multi-day fishing trip, whereas the accident took place approximately 47 kilometers off the coast.

Preliminary investigations by the police suggest that the collision was caused by heavy rainfall in the area.

The deceased, a 47-year-old from Nintavur, drowned, while a 60-year-old resident of the Oluvil area is reported missing, according to police. Meanwhile, another fisherman who was onboard the vessel in question and sustained injuries during the accident, has been admitted to Trincomalee Hospital for treatment.

The two remaining fishermen onboard are safe, the police confirmed.
