Australian High Commissioner hosts Australia Day 2024

The Australian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Paul Stephens hosted a reception to celebrate Australia Day 2024 on 24 January.

Ports, Shipping and Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva joined the reception as the Chief Guest.

Australia Day is an opportunity for Australians to come together and celebrate our modern, multicultural nation. Following Australia’s recent victory in the World Cup, this year’s Australia Day reception was used to highlight the passion Australians and Sri Lankans share for the game of cricket.

The event also showcased our longstanding bilateral ties that encompass many sectors such as trade and investment, education, maritime cooperation, culture and sport.
