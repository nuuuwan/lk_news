Doctors suspect chemical used for dialysis caused series of deaths at Kurunegala Hospital

Doctors of the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital suspect that the recent deaths of several dialysis patients was due to a chemical used for the treatment.

The dialysis unit of the hospital was temporarily closed on 23 February, after a series of patient deaths, attributed to a suspected infection at the time, were reported since January this year.

While an investigation was previously conducted at the institutional level to determine if the fatalities were a result of an infection caused by the germs that entered the bloodstream or the chemicals administered during the dialysis procedure, the Ministry of Health also appointed a 5-member committee of experts to look into the matter at the ministerial level.

Meanwhile, measures are also afoot to appoint a two-member committee of expert doctors specializing in blood and blood transfusion procedures, Health Secretary Dr. Palitha Maheepala said.

In light of the situation, the authorities of the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital have decided to direct kidney patients in need of dialysis to the Kuliyapitiya, Narammala, Dambadeniya Nikaweratiya and Nikawewa Hospitals for treatment.

Reports have revealed that the five patients had died due to complications that arose after their platelet levels dropped rapidly during the dialysis treatment.

Director of the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital Dr. Chandana Kendanagamuwa stated, however, that the exact cause of these deaths is yet to be acertained.

Thus, he noted that given the current circumstances, measures have been taken to evacuate other patients at the Kurunegala Hospital as well, as a safety measure.

Meanwhile, officials from the Health Ministry, too are slated to visit the Teaching Hospital today as part of the ongoing investigations.
