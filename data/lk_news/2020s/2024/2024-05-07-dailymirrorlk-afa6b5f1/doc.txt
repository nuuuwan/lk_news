Town Hall blocked due to university non-academic workersâ€™ protest

Roads leading to the Town Hall area have been blocked due to a protest launched by university non-academic workers in front of the University Grants Commission (UGC), police said.

They said about 5,000 non-academic workers have gathered in front of the UGC over eleven main demands, including the non-rectification of salary anomalies and the non-receipt of allowances and other facilities promised by the government.
