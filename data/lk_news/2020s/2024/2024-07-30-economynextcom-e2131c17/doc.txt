Sri Lanka seeing influenza spread among children: Doctor

ECONOMYNEXT – A pediatric specialist at the Lady Ridgeway Children’s Hospital in Colombo has warned that influenza types A and B and an upper respiratory viral fever are spreading among children in Sri Lanka.

Pediatrician Dr Deepal Perera has urged parents to be aware of flu like symptoms, including fever with headache, cough, cold, sneezing, body aches, difficulty in breathing and vomiting.

“If such symptoms spread quickly in classes and day care centers and homes, this could be a viral disease of the upper respiratory tract or influenza,” Dr Perera said.

A sputum test can check for influenza and if so anti-virals will be administered, he was quoted as saying in a government statement.

“Antibiotics are not necessary as this is a viral infection and if the cough persists, it may lead to childhood asthma, so proper treatment should be given.”

The pediatrician said those with symptoms should wear face masks and that children with symptoms should be kept at home.

More natural liquid food, lots of rest, an recommended dosage of paracetamol should be given to sick children, he said.

Children under 2 years, adults over 65 years, people with chronic respiratory diseases, immunocompromised people and pregnant mothers, could develop complications he warned. (Colombo/Jul30/2024)
