Several spells of showers expected in parts of the island

The Meteorology Department says several spells of showers will occur in Western, Sabaragamuwa and Southern provinces and in Kandy and Nuwara-Eliya districts.

Showers or thundershowers may occur at a few places in Eastern and Uva provinces during the evening or night, it said.

Strong winds of about 40-45 kmph can be expected at times over the western slopes of the central hills and in North-central and Southern provinces.

The general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
