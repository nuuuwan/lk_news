Two more arrested over ‘poisoning’ of two suspects in police custody

The main suspect and another have been arrested for allegedly aiding and abetting the recent ‘poisoning’ of two suspects who were detained in a cell at the Aduruppuveediya police station.

The arrests were made by the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) in the areas of Wattala and Kotahena on Thursday afternoon (Feb.15).

The duo was apprehended with more than 23 grams of methamphetamine (‘Ice’). They were identified as residents of Wattala and Colombo 13, aged 25 and 32 years, respectively.

Preliminary police investigations have revealed that the crime was carried out based on the directive of a notorious criminal who is currently hiding overseas. The CCD is probing the incident further.

On February 07, two suspects who were held in a cell at the Aduruppuveediya police station had fallen critically ill after consuming a packet of milk handed to them by a visitor. The suspects in question had been arrested by the police over a recent shooting incident that took place in Jinthupitiya.

On January 25, two assailants on a motorcycle had opened fire in Jinthupitiya, leaving a youth injured. The gunman had fled the crime scene while bystanders had captured his accomplice. The fleeing gunman was later apprehended and brought to the Aduruppuveediya police station for onward interrogations. Later, another suspect was also taken into custody for aiding and abetting the shooting.

As such, the apprehended gunman and the third suspect had reportedly been held in the same cell at the Aduruppuveediya police station.

The girlfriend of the gunman had visited them at the police station on February 07, followed by another visitor, who had given them two buns and a packet of milk.

Later, the police recovered CCTV footage of the suspected visitor going into a shop before arriving at the police station. Police revealed that the suspected person was a drug addict.

Against this backdrop, three police officers – the Acting OIC of Aduruppuveediya police station, a Reserve Officer and the security police officer who was on duty at the police station’s gate at the time, were interdicted in connection with the incident.
