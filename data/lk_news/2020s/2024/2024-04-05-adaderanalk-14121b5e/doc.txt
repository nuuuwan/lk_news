Police chief gives undertaking before Supreme Court

Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon on Friday (05) gave an undertaking to the Supreme Court pertaining to the transfers of five Officers-in-Charge (OICs) after the houses of a number of politicians were torched during the civil unrest in May 2022.

The officers in question, filing petitions before the countryâ€™s apex court, alleged that the transfers were not based on their seniority.

A three-member judge bench led by Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya, on Thursday (04) issued summons, directing IGP Tennakoon to appear before the court to present oral submissions regarding the matter. Complying with the order, the police chief arrived at the Supreme Court complex earlier on Friday.

During the court proceedings, IGP Tennakoon, through the Additional Solicitor General, communicated to the court that the five officers would be assigned to police stations commensurate with their previous precincts.
