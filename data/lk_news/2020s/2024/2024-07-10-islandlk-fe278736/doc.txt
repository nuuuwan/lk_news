Are there any outstanding debts or financial obligations that could impact the company post-IPO?

No, the gearing ratio of the Company is only ~26% as per the interim financial statements for 31st March 2024. For a manufacturing company, having a gearing ratio at this low level is positive. It’s also important to understand that the interest-bearing debt with the company is mainly related to the working capital requirements of the company.

The Company is valued at a post money valuation of approximately ~LKR 3.5 billion at the IPO price of LKR 7.5 per share.

How was the valuation determined and what is the pricing strategy for the IPO shares?

The valuation was determined through an independent valuation carried out by KPMG. They have used different valuation methodologies such as a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Market Relative Peer Valuation as well.

On the DCF method, KPMG has valued the share at LKR 10.30 which indicates that the IPO price is at 27% discount to this. On the Market Relative Valuation Method, KPMG has valued the share at LKR 15.30 which means the IPO Price is at a substantial 51% discount.

How many shares are being offered and what percentage of the company do they represent?

The IPO offers prospective investors the chance to subscribe for 80,786,600 shares of the company. This represents a 17.16% stake in the company.

How does the company plan to utilize the funds raised from the IPO?

Out of the funds that will be raised into the company, LKR 90mn would be utilized to expand manufacturing capacity through the purchase of a new extruder line. This will enable the company to ramp up its current extruder processing speed from 150 metres per minute to 600 metres per minute with the new machine.

~LKR 20mn will go towards funding future working capital requirements and the balance of the IPO will be towards a partial sale of existing shares.’
