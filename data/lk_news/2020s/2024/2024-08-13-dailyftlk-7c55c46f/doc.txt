Australia begins Indo-Pacific Endeavour in Sri Lanka

Australia’s flagship regional engagement activity, Indo-Pacific Endeavour (IPE), commences this week in Sri Lanka with a number of engagements on bilateral priorities.

IPE supports the Australian Government’s focus on deepening our diplomatic and defence partnerships across Southeast Asia and the Northeast Indian Ocean, and reinforces Australia’s commitment to a peaceful, stable and prosperous region, founded on openness, respect for sovereignty and adherence to agreed rules and norms.

The first engagement of IPE 2024 will be a law of the sea workshop focused on maritime surveillance and involving members of the Sri Lanka Air Force Maritime Squadron. Participants will engage in scenario-based training addressing regional security issues such as drug smuggling and illegal fishing.

Other IPE 2024 activities in Sri Lanka include a combined diving activity that will see members of the Royal Australian Navy and Sri Lankan Navy exchange knowledge and skills.

IPE 2024 will also conduct activities with Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam over the next five months.

Royal Australian Navy ships, Australian Army detachments and Royal Australian Air Force aircraft will support military exercises and engagement activities, sharing information and providing training opportunities throughout IPE 2024.

Other agencies will also contribute to a range of activities, reflecting Australia’s whole-of-government commitment to regional stability and security. In Sri Lanka this includes engagements with RAN Maritime Border Command Commander Rear Admiral Brett Sonter.

IPE 2024 RAN Commander Commodore Michael Harris OAM said: “Australia and Sri Lanka have a common interest in an open, stable and prosperous Indian Ocean region. Indo-Pacific Endeavour supports Australia and Sri Lanka working together. We are glad to be of, with, and for the region.

This week’s engagements will deepen our close cooperation on regional security challenges, especially in maritime surveillance to combat transnational organised crime and illegal fishing.

Australia and Sri Lanka enjoy strong people-to-people links. The activities that are part of IPE 2024 will also build friendships and understanding between our two countries.

We look forward to building stronger defence ties, learning from one another, and deepening our close cooperation this week.”
