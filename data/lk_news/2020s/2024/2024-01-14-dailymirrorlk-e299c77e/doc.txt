Anura vows to dissolve President’s security detail, vehicle fleet once elected

Hambantota, Jan. 14 (Daily Mirror)- Claiming that a future NPP government would stop politicians’ misuse of public money, NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today they will dissolve the large security detail of the President and the fleet of expensive vehicles used by politicians.

Speaking at the Hambantota District Women's Convention, he said the NPP will prove in practice that they will not misuse or loot a cent of public money and set an example to the people.

“The President has thousands of army and police teams assigned for his security. Police stations at village level have only about 10 police personnel. We will bring the security detail of the President to the Galle Face and dissolve it and send them to police stations in the villages. The President and other politicians use expensive vehicles that run only two to three kilometres a litre. We will stop using such expensive vehicles. We will ensure transparency in construction works and development in the country. We will set an example to the people so that they can follow and come forward and do their part for the sake of the country,” he said.

Dissanayake said the future election is not just another election to vote a political party and form a government, but it will be a struggle to rescue the country from corrupt and destructive rulers.

“It will be a freedom fight just as we rescued the country from white people,” he said.

He said taking over power will not be the end of the struggle for the NPP but it will be the beginning of the struggle to build the country.

“We will initially ensure basic needs such as food, education and health facilities. Then, We have a long term plan to create a stable economy,” he said.
