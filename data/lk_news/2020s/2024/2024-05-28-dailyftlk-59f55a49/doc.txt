SJB accuses NPP of sabotaging debate plans

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Nalin Bandara yesterday accused the National People’s Power (NPP) of attempting to sabotage the plans to hold a debate between the leaders and economic councils of the parties.

In a letter to the NPP he accused the rival of employing diversionary tactics to prevent the scheduled debates between the economic council and party leaders from proceeding as intended. Bandara in the letter requested the NPP to provide a date for the debate between the Economic Councils.

Bandara stressed the importance of initiating discussions on the economic policies of both parties amidst the current economic challenges facing the country. He emphasised the need to prioritise these discussions through the Economic Council debate.

“Despite our readiness to engage in a leadership debate as proposed by your party, it is perplexing that you are now seeking to evade the Economic Council debate. We have readily accepted your proposal for a leadership debate without any reluctance. However, we are puzzled by the lack of clarity regarding your party’s stance on the fundamental proposal for the debate, especially considering the various proposals put forward intermittently,” he noted.  Bandara reiterated the SJB’s stance that the economic discourse should precede the leadership debate, as originally suggested.

“Hence, we implore you to promptly finalise the date for the Economic Committee debate from the provided options. Furthermore, we extend another invitation to work together in coordinating both discussions, encompassing the selection of appropriate channels, moderators, and all essential arrangements,” he said.
