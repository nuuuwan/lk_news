Shine 50 Awards Night Celebrates Sri Lanka’s Impactful Young Leaders

Neon and Echelon Media recently hosted the Shine 50 Awards and Networking Evening at the Oak Room Ballroom, Cinnamon Grand, celebrating 50 young women making remarkable contributions across Sri Lanka.

The event, attended by U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie J. Chung, honoured women aged 18 to 35 who are driving change in diverse fields such as entrepreneurship, environmental advocacy, the arts, science, and technology.

An initiative launched by Neon and Echelon in partnership with USAID, Shine 50 celebrates young women redefining leadership and innovation in their respective sectors. These bold, brilliant, and unstoppable women captivated the evening with their stories, serving as a poignant reflection that Sri Lanka’s future will be shaped not by its past but by new voices, perspectives, and leadership exuded by the Shine 50 inductees.

The event featured inspiring keynote speeches by Randhula De Silva and Krystle Ried Wijesuriya and stirring performances by singer Natasha Rathnayake about the power of women.

Shine 50 will extend its impact through regional networking and knowledge-sharing events in Kandy, Galle, and Jaffna in the coming weeks.
