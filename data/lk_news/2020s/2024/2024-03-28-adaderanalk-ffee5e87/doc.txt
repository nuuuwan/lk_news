Legal action against Cabraal over 2012 Greek treasury bonds purchase

Legal action has been instituted against five individuals including former Governor of Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) Ajith Nivard Cabraal, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) says.

Accordingly, the Bribery Commission on March 26 instituted legal action in the Colombo High Court under Case No. HCB 271/2024 after concluding its investigations into a complaint filed by former MP Sujeewa Senasinghe.

The complaint had been put forward against the Central Bankâ€™s purchase of Treasury Bonds issued by the Government of Greece in 2012 when the southeastern European country was experiencing a severe financial crisis.

In his complaint, Senasinghe alleged that the purchase was made despite the knowledge of the financial crisis faced by Greece, and caused a loss of more than Rs. 1.84 billion to the Government of Sri Lanka.

Upon concluding its investigations, the Bribery Commission has filed a case before the Colombo High Court against Ajith Nivard Cabraal, Kankanamge Gamage Don Dharmasena Deerasinghe, Bendarage Don Wasantha Ananda Silva, Chandrasiri Jayasinghe Panditha Siriwardena and Harankaha Arachchilage Karunaratne.
