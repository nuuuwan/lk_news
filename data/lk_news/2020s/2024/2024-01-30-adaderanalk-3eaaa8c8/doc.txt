CEB makes bill payments more convenient

The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has introduced several new methods for consumers to pay their electricity bills in a more efficient manner.

As such, CEB consumers are now able to pay their bills via the CEBCare mobile app, the official CEB website, online banking services, CEB or bank kiosk machines or at any post office, or through mCash at any Cargills or Keells supermarkets.

Issuing a statement, the CEB urged consumers to dial the ‘1987’ CEB hotline in relation to any issues that may arise when settling their bills.
