No health risks from cow measles: Expert

Colombo, May 22 (Daily Mirror)- Consuming milk and meat from animals infected with cow measles poses no health risks to humans, Dr. Hemali Kothalawala, Director General of the Department of Animal Production and Health said.

There is no threat of the disease spreading to humans, she emphasized.

In response to recent reports of cow measles in Nuwara Eliya, the Department of Animal Production and Health, in collaboration with the private sector, has implemented a joint plan to provide necessary vaccines for disease control.

Earlier this year, cow measles was reported in the Jaffna area. The Ministry of Agriculture noted that the disease was controlled effectively through prompt vaccination efforts.

Further, Janaka Dharmakirthi, Secretary of the Ministry, stated that if current vaccine supplies prove insufficient, urgent measures will be taken to procure additional doses.
