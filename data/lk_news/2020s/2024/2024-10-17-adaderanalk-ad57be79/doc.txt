The Meteorology Department says showers or thundershowers will occur at times in Northern province and fairly heavy showers above 50mm are likely at some places.

Several spells of showers will occur in Western, Sabaragamuwa and North-western provinces and in Galle, Matara, Kandy and Nuwara-eliya districts.

Showers or thundershowers may occur at a few places in Uva province and in Ampara and Batticaloa districts during the evening or night, it added.
