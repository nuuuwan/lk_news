Current economic crisis is political and can only be solved through political change

President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s statement in Parliament on Wednesday that “resolution of the economic crisis lies not in a political but economic and scientific solutions” is incorrect.

We need to categorically state that the economic crisis has a well-defined identifiable disproportionately large political component.

Incompetent corrupt democratically elected politicians taking unscientific and economically incorrect political decisions to meet their short and long term political goals which were justified and sustained by a cohort of absolutely incompetent cohorts of ‘yes sir’ spineless Government officials who were political appointees.

As such the solution to the current economic crisis is bringing about an immediate change in the mode and style of governance and government by politicians and bureaucrats through a process of elections where the people decide their political and economic future.

As such the President’s statement that the current economic crisis is not political is misleading and perhaps rooted in his personal desire to democratise his already expired political shelf life to the further detriment of Sri Lanka in general and Sri Lankan politics
