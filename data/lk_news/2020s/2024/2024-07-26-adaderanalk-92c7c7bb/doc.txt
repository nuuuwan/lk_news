Decision to appoint IGP was constitutional - Speaker tells Parliament

The Speaker of the Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena has informed the Parliament that the decision to appoint the Inspector General of Police (IGP) was correct, legal, constitutional, and made in good faith.

He further said that the situation with regard to the IGP cannot be resolved even by the President, and the matter must be sorted out in court if necessary.

The Speaker made these comments following the special statement delivered in Parliament by the Prime Minister regarding the Supreme Court decision on the IGP.

Speaking in Parliament this morning (26), PM Dinesh Gunawardena had clarified that the President has no legal provisions at this moment to appoint an Acting IGP.

The Prime Minister also emphasized that the position of the IGP is not vacated presently.

He also stated that the court cannot change the approval granted by the Constitutional Council to appoint the current IGP.

“We remind the Speaker and Parliament that the order of the Supreme Court suspending the duties of the IGP should be nullified. We request the Speaker to intervene as soon as possible in this regard,” he said.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued an interim order preventing Deshabandu Tennakoon from performing duties and functioning in the position of the IGP.

The Supreme Court had issued this order after granting leave to proceed with the nine petitions, filed by several parties including Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, challenging Tennakoon’s appointment as the IGP.

The Supreme Court had also ordered the President to name a suitable person for the position of IGP, for the duration of the interim order being enforced against Deshabandu Tennakoon.
