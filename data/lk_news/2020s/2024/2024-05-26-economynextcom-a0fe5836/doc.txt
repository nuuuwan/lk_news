Strong winds switch off 467,500 Sri Lanka electricity customers

ECONOMYNEXT – Strong winds and pouring rains which brought down trees, triggered floods and landslides have cut off power to 467,500 electricity users over the past week, state-run Ceylon Electricity Board said.

By May 26 afternoon, power has been restored to about 425,000 customers.

From May 21 to 26, 26,700 breakdowns have been fixed, the CEB said.

“CEB management and staff are working around the clock to restore power to all affected consumer,” a CEB statement said.

The CEB had received around 61,000 breakdown complaints and new ones still coming in.

Separately the CEB’s Engineers Union said unfilled vacancies and abolishing some maintenance engineering positions had led to delays in restoring power and could in the future also affect safety and customer service levels. (Colombo/May26/2024)
