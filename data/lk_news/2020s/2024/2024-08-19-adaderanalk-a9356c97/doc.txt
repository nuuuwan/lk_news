Kush cannabis cultivation busted inside house in Malabe, 2 arrested

Western Province - South Crimes Division officers have raided a Kush cannabis cultivation illegally carried out within a two-storey house at Kahanthota Road in Pittugala, Malabe.

The raid, which was carried out last afternoon (19), has led to the discovery of a highly sophisticated cultivation setup, where approximately 174 Kush cannabis plants were cultivated inside an air-conditioned room on the ground floor of the residence, police said.

During the raid, one of the suspects was caught in the process of packaging the drugs, and preparing for distribution. Police estimate the street value of the seized ‘Kush’ cannabis to be around Rs. 100 million.

Further investigations have revealed that the house, which was purportedly operating under the guise of a tea-packing business, had been rented out for the purpose of running this illegal operation.

Two suspects, aged 25 and 48, who were arrested at the scene are scheduled to be produced before the Kaduwela Magistrate’s Court, police said.
