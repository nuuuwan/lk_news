Cabinet approves second national action plan to eliminate sexual and gender-based harassment

The Cabinet of Ministers on 9 July approved the proposal for a new multi-sectoral national action plan aimed at eliminating sexual and gender-based harassment in Sri Lanka.

This initiative, titled the National Action Plan II (2024-2028) was presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who also serves as the Minister of Women, Children Affairs, and Social Empowerment.

The approval follows a comprehensive follow-up and assessment process that evaluated the impact of the first national action plan, which was implemented from 2012-2020.

The assessment highlighted the necessity for continued policy involvement to ensure the rights of women, men, children and all gender-diverse groups to live in a fair and socially inclusive environment, free from violence and harassment.

The new action plan has been developed in consultation with various stakeholders, reflecting a broad and inclusive approach to policy-making.

It aims to address the gaps identified in the previous plan and implement more effective strategies to combat sexual and gender-based harassment.

“Ensuring the safety and dignity of all citizens is paramount. This new action plan is a testament to our commitment to creating a society where everyone can live without fear of harassment or discrimination,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.
