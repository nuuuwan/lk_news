Legal action against 50 bakeries over weight of bread

The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) has raided around 50 bakeries for failure to follow the gazette issued stipulating a standard weight for a loaf of bread and failure to display prices.

Accordingly, the CAA stated that legal action would be initiated against the relevant bakeries.

The Consumer Affairs Authority launched island-wide raids yesterday (05), following a special gazette issued specifying the standard weight of a loaf of bread and making it mandatory to display the weight of bread displayed for sale.

Thus, the standard weight of a loaf of bread should be 450g with an allowed deficiency of 13.5g and for half a loaf of bread the standard weight is stipulated as 225g with a deficiency of 9g.

The CAA has noted that any type of bread manufactured, packed, stored, offered for sale, displayed for sale or sold retail or wholesale should contain the standard weight specified in the gazette extraordinary.
