One-Month-Old falls from moving trishaw, unharmed

Kitulgala, March 1 (Daily Mirror) - A one-month-old infant fell from a moving trishaw onto the Colombo-Hatton highway near Gurumetiya, Kitulgala, but miraculously escaped injury on Thursday night.

The mother, traveling with others from Negombo, had fallen asleep in the back of the trishaw when the infant fell off her lap.

Witnesses in a car following the trishaw noticed the child on the road and took it to the Kitulgala Police Station, where the baby was immediately sent to the Kitulgala Hospital.

The mother and others, unaware of the incident, continued their journey.

When they became aware of the missing baby went back in search and found out from the residents of the location that the baby had been hospitalized.

They then went to Kitulgala Hospital and reunited with the baby.

Doctors examined the infant and found no injuries. However, the baby was later transferred to the Karawanella Base Hospital for further observation, accompanied by the mother.
