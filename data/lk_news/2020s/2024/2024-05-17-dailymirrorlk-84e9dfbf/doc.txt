MPs exploit liquor permit system, selling for up to Rs. 50 Million

Colombo, May 17 (Daily Mirror) - The MPs across the political divide are inclined to secure liquor permits under the names of their associates and relatives only to be sold for amounts as large as Rs.50 million at times, the Daily Mirror learns.

The government has initiated the process of issuing liquor licenses under a renewed criterion which will provide for the establishment of 478 new liquor shops in the country.

An informed source said a top parliamentary committee has started inquiring into the criterion adopted in the issuance and approval of licenses to open liquor shops in the country. According to the source, the MPs, both from the government and the opposition, have sought to obtain licenses under the names of their relatives or associates to be sold for hefty sums.

In political circles, it is widely seen as inducements being offered to parliamentarians from different hues ahead of the presidential election.

“In certain cases, they also settle for lesser amounts,” the source said.

Asked about the new criterion, a top official of the Excise Department said no liquor shop will be allowed within the radius of 100 meters of schools and places of religious worship as outlined in the current regulations as well.

However, he said one-off payment of Rs.15 million should be paid for shops to be opened in the municipal areas under the proposed criterion, Rs.12 .5 million in the urban council areas and Rs.10 million in the Pradeshiya Sabha areas. Besides, an annual fee of Rs.1 million should be paid in the municipal areas, Rs.800, 000 in the urban council areas and Rs.600, 000 in the Pradeshiya Sabha areas.

He said that no license had been issued under the name of any MP. Yet, he admitted the ability to transfer permits to anyone.
