NDB’s Santa promotion nears its end

NDB Bank’s much-loved tradition of bringing Santa to your doorstep is drawing to a close. With just a few days remaining until the 31st of December 2024, families still have the chance to welcome Santa home and create magical memories that will last a lifetime.

Parents can delight their children by simply making a deposit of Rs. 50,000 or more into their child’s NDB Shilpa Children’s Savings Account. As part of this festive tradition, your child will receive a special gift of their choice, delivered right to your doorstep by Santa himself – spreading the joy and wonder of Christmas like never before.

The NDB Shilpa Children’s Savings Account encourages children to embrace the importance of saving from an early age, with a range of exclusive benefits such as double interest rates, special gift schemes, free hospitalisation cover, life insurance cover, and academic rewards for excellence in key examinations.

This unique campaign, launched to bring smiles and financial awareness together, reflects NDB Bank’s commitment to empowering the next generation while creating meaningful experiences for families. As the year draws to a close, it’s the perfect time for parents to take advantage of this magical opportunity before the campaign ends.

Visit your nearest NDB branch today or call 011 744 88 88 to open an NDB Shilpa Children’s Savings Account and make this holiday season unforgettable.

With NDB Bank, it’s not just about saving – it’s about bringing home the magic of Christmas. Let Santa ring your doorbell one last time this year!
