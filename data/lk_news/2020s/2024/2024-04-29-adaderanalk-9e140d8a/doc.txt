Geologists assess landslide-prone area near Uma Oya Project in Karandagolla

A team of senior geologists from the National Building Research Organization (NBRO) engaged in a special observation of the reactivated landslide-prone area near the Uma Oya Project in Karandagolla today (29).

The Badulla District Secretary has confirmed that efforts are underway to reduce water levels in the hilly terrain through short-term methods to mitigate landslide risks.

The sloping terrain extending around two acres known as Malittagolla in the Karandagolla area of Ella has displayed signs of landslide susceptibility recently. Local residents have raised concerns, attributing the situation to potential impact from the Uma Oya project.

Consequently, the Ella Divisional Secretariat, Ella Pradeshiya Sabha, along with the Sri Lanka Army and the police, are collaborating to redirect waterways contributing to landslide risks in the short term.
