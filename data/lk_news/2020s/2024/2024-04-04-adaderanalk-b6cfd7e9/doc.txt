Immediate investigation into unregistered doctors and medical centres

The Ministry of Health has decided to launch an immediate investigation in search of the fake doctors and illegal medical centres operative in the country. This decision has been taken after taking into account the complaints received regarding the matter.

It is mandatory for all doctors to register themselves with the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), while the private medical institutions are required to be registered at the provincial level.

However, the Ministry of Health stated that complaints have been received regarding a number of unregistered doctors and medical centres being operated across the island.

Accordingly, the Director General of Health Services has instructed all provincial and district level authorities to initiate an immediate investigation into the matter, and to take strict legal action against all unregistered doctors and private medical institutions.

Meanwhile, the Health Ministry also urges the general public to provide information regarding such unqualified doctors.
