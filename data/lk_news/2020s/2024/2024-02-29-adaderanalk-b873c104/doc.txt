SC refuses leave to proceed with Sumanthiran’s petition against Online Safety Bill

The Supreme Court has refused to grant leave to proceed with the petition filed by Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP M.A. Sumanthiran, challenged the passing of the much-disputed Online Safety Bill in Parliament.

Sumanthiran filed a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition before the Supreme Court on 14 February, naming Parliament Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena and the Attorney General as repondents.

In his petition, the TNA MP challenged the Speaker’s certification of the Online Safety Act, claiming that several recommendations made by the Supreme Court with regards to certain provisions of the Act had been ignored by the Speaker, and that the Attorney General had failed to diligently advise both, the Parliament  and its Speaker regarding the same.

The Online Safety Bill has been a subject of debate and contention, with several parties having raised concerns about potential limitations on freedom of expression, and other potential violations of the Constitution through its provisions.
