Semasinghe warns of stability risks without continuity in Govt. programs

State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe yesterday underscored the criticality of continuity in Government programs to sustain the hard-earned progress made by the country.

Speaking to the media at the inauguration of the swimming pool at Anuradhapura St. Joseph’s College, he highlighted the fragility of the economy’s stability should governance transition without a cohesive plan.

Semasinghe warned that a leadership change lacking a clear strategy could potentially plunge the country into a deeper crisis than experienced in recent history.

He stressed the imperative for future administrations to uphold and advance the ongoing development agenda to prevent such regression.

Semasinghe also criticised the Opposition’s stance on negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), asserting that their avoidance of such talks signifies a lack of foresight and financial prudence.

He argued that a political entity devoid of a comprehensive program aligned with the aspirations of the populace would struggle to earn the trust of the people.

The State Minister asserted the urgent need for educational reforms aimed at boosting economic stability and resilience.

He stressed the symbiotic relationship between economic and educational reforms, noting that robust educational initiatives are instrumental in averting future crises and fostering sustainable development.
