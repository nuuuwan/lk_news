Sri Lankan students in America increases by 10-pct: US Embassy

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lankan students studying at US colleges and universities during the 2023-2024 academic year increased by 10 percent, according to the 2024 Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange, the US Embassy in Colombo said.

“This reflects a growing trend of Sri Lankan students seeking world-class education in the United States and underscores the robust educational ties between the two nations, as well as the global appeal of US higher education institutions,” the embassy said in a statement.

The Open Doors Report, celebrating its 75th year, is a comprehensive census of international student mobility trends.

This year, the US welcomed an all-time high of 1.12 million international students from more than 210 countries and territories.

Sri Lanka’s contribution to this number demonstrates the continued appeal of US higher education as a destination of choice for students, the embassy said.

“The 10% increase in Sri Lankan students studying in the United States demonstrates the power of international education in building strong connections between our people,” US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung said.

“US universities offer Sri Lankan students access to world-class education, cutting-edge research, and lifelong networks, equipping them to succeed in an increasingly interconnected world.

“This growth reflects the strength of the US-Sri Lanka partnership and our shared dedication to education and innovation.”

The United States also marked 25 years of EducationUSA, the global educational advising network that provides resources for students worldwide, including in Sri Lanka.

“Through programs like EducationUSA, we remain committed to supporting students interested in this cross-cultural exchange, and I encourage even more Sri Lankan students to consider the transformative opportunities that studying in the United States can provide.”  (Colombo/Nov19/2024)
