Sri Lanka Team starts new initiative: recognizes on-field performances

Mar. 5 (SLC) - As part of a new initiative by the national team to recognize ‘on-field excellence,’ Charith Asalanka was awarded the ‘Orange Cap and the Coin’ by the team for his excellent fielding efforts during yesterday’s game against Bangladesh.

Asalanka, apart from his batting heroics, held onto three catches, two of them coming at the most crucial moment in Sri Lanka’s winning cause.

Upul Chandana, the team's fielding coach, awarded the 'Orange Cap and the Coin' to Asalanka.

This latest move, the team management believes, will encourage players to perform at the highest level, and it intends to expand the recognition into other areas such as ‘bowling and batting, as well.
