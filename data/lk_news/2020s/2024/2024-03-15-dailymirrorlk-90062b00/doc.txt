This new marketing strategy can leave a strong emotional imprint that can enhance brand recognition and engagement

‘Sensational marketing’ is a term that is not widely recognised or defined in the field of marketing. However, it could refer to a marketing approach that aims to create excitement, generate attention and provoke strong emotional responses from the target audience. Such an approach may be used to make a product or service stand out in a crowded marketplace or to create a memorable marketing campaign. Here is an introduction to the concept of sensational marketing.

In today’s highly competitive and ever-evolving world of marketing, capturing the attention of consumers is an ongoing challenge. Traditional marketing strategies often struggle to break through the noise and connect with an audience bombarded by a constant stream of information. In response to this, a concept known as “sensational marketing” has emerged.

Sensational marketing is not a widely recognised term within the marketing field, but it summarises a unique approach that influences the power of sensations, emotions, and memorable experiences to create a lasting impact. It seeks to surprise, thrill, or even shock the audience, leaving a strong emotional imprint that can enhance brand recognition and engagement.

This marketing approach is characterised by a few key principles:

1.Emotional Resonance: Sensational marketing aims to trigger deep emotional responses in consumers. It seeks to create an experience that goes beyond the rational, tapping into feelings of awe, excitement, joy, or even intrigue.

In the era of digital marketing, sensational campaigns often find a home on social media platforms and other online channels, where content can quickly go viral

2.Memorability: The core idea behind sensational marketing is to be memorable. By crafting marketing campaigns or content that stand out in the minds of the audience, brands can leave a lasting impression that extends beyond the immediate moment of exposure.

3.Attention-Grabbing: Sensational marketing employs strategies designed to grab attention in a world where attention spans are short and distractions are abundant. It is often characterized by bold, creative, or even unconventional tactics.

4.Viral Potential: Sensational marketing often leverages the power of social sharing and word-of-mouth. When something evokes a strong emotional response, people are more likely to share it with their networks, amplifying its reach.

5.Risk and Reward: Sensational marketing can be a high-risk, high-reward strategy. While a successful sensational campaign can generate substantial buzz and business, it can also backfire if not executed thoughtfully.

In the era of digital marketing, sensational campaigns often find a home on social media platforms and other online channels, where content can quickly go viral.

While sensational marketing can be a powerful tool for brands, it is essential to strike a balance between creating excitement and maintaining brand authenticity and ethics. Not all industries or brands may find sensational marketing appropriate.

In the analysis of the context, there are heart touching actions, feelings, words, sounds, art clips, scenes, colours and logos are more sensitive to the audience of the target market. Especially the nature of the behaviour in Sri Lankans is more sensitive when compared to the sensitivity of people in other countries. We love to nature, kindness and are honest with their religions as well as we are happy in every moment of life. If anything happened within a few moments it can be changed by understating the reality of life because of the usages of the Buddhist cultures. Then our sensors are more in tune with nature. Then most corporate sector people can use this concept for their moves to introducing a new product or service to the market. This emotional concept is more popular at the corporate sector with brand and branding propaganda as well as other promotional and advertising activities.

While the specific tactics and channels have evolved, the fundamental idea of employing sensational elements to create impact remains a consistent theme in marketing history.
