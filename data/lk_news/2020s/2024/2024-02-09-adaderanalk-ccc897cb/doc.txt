New ‘Aswesuma’ applications to be called from tomorrow

Calling new applications for the ‘Aswesuma’ welfare benefits program is scheduled to commence tomorrow (Feb.10) to select 400,000 more beneficiaries.

The Finance State Ministry said certain criteria for the selection of beneficiaries would be revised based on the suggestions made by various parties.

Meanwhile, the monthly allowances paid to disabled persons, kidney patients and elderly citizens are to be retrospectively increased from January 2024.

Accordingly, kidney patients and disabled persons’ allowances will be raised from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 7,500, while the elderly citizens’ allowance will be increased from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 3,000.

On Thursday (Feb.08), State Minister Shehan Semasinghe revealed that ‘Aswesuma’ beneficiaries who are entitled to these allowances are to be identified within the first quarter of 2024 and paid the increased payments starting April 01.

Additionally, it has been decided to continue the payments for the ‘vulnerable’ and ‘transitional’ social groups up until December 31. The existing ‘vulnerable’ and ‘transitional’ social groups are planned to be amalgamated in the future. Subsequently, a total of 800,000 families will be considered ‘vulnerable’ and an allowance of Rs. 5,000/- will be paid to them. The ‘transitional’ social group now receives only Rs. 2,500.

The total number of ‘Aswesuma’ beneficiaries now stands over 1.7 million. The government aims to extend these benefits to a total of 2 million people.
