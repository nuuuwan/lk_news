Rulers trying to curb freedom of online speech, after bankrupting Sri Lanka: opposition

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s rulers are trying to curb the freedom of speech of people after bankrupting the country, opposition chief whip Lakshman Kiriella told parliament in a debate over a controversial law to control online speech.

“We agree that regulation is needed, but this Bill should be postponed and get suggestions from the opposition about our doubts and fears (se-ka san-ka) on this,” Kiriella said.

The UN and several international companies have opposed this Bill, Kiriella said. “The international community will be against us if we bring this law.”

“Lajjayi (shame), instead of going home you are trying to bring this law.”

Ruling party legislator Ajith Rajapakse said there were people who mis-used social media.

The opposition has pledged to repeal the law if they come to power. (Colombo/Jan24/2024)
