Another happening scene…

Although the young ones of the good ole days are now grown up and married, having families, etc., I’m glad they still keep in touch with me, through my pages in

They all remember the days when there were get-together events, outings, etc., with some of our leading musicians joining in as well.

Three stalwarts, from that era, are planning a day’s outing in order to meet and greet some of the older folks, and also the present day young ones.

Dilanth De Silva, Mazeeha Halaj and Dayanthi Senanayake, popular figures on social media (Facebook), say that the outing will be to a resort in Negombo and will include lunch, afternoon tea, snacks, etc., plus fun games, with prizes to be won.

The date mentioned is Saturday, 27th July, but they need confirmation from those wanting to be a part of this fun-filled package by 20th July.

You are required to call Dilanth (0772364301), Mazeeha (0775199807) or Dayanthi (0773541254) for more details, and the cost.
