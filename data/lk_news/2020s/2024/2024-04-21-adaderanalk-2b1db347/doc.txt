Sri Lanka marks 5 years since deadly Easter Sunday attacks

All the churches across the island observed a two-minutes silence to mark the fifth anniversary of the deadly terror attacks on Easter Sunday (April 21) in 2019.

This moment of silence was held at 08.45 a.m. today in remembrance of those who lost their lives in the tragic bombings, according to the communications unit of the Archdiocese of Colombo.

Sri Lanka was left devastated on April 21, 2019 after a group of suicide attackers of the now-outlawed local Islamic extremist organization National Thowheed Jamaat (NTJ) carried out a series of coordinated bomb blasts at St. Anthony’s Church in Kochchikade, St. Sebastian’s Church in Katuwapitiya, Zion Church in Batticaloa, Cinnamon Grand, Kingsbury and Shangri-La hotels in Colombo and a guest house in Dehiwala, leaving more than 260 people including foreigners dead and at least 500 people injured.
