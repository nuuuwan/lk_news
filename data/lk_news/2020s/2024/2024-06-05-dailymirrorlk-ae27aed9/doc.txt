A/L classes to commence tomorrow before release of O/L results

Colombo, June 5 (Daily Mirror) - Following Cabinet approval, the General Certificate of Education (GCE) Advanced Level (A/L) classes will commence tomorrow, prior to the release of the GCE Ordinary Level (O/L) examination results.

Cabinet approval was granted on May 14 to commence A/L classes soon after the completion of the O/L examinations.

Accordingly, the pilot programme will be launched at Ananda College, Colombo tomorrow at 7.45 a.m.

The event will be held with the patronage of Education Minister Susil Premajayantha and Ministry Secretary Thileka Jayasundara.

The period before commencing A/L classes often leads to a decrease in students' inclination to pursue GCE (A/L) education and contributes to various social issues.

Considering these factors, it has been deemed appropriate to start the GCE (A/L) education in schools immediately after the completion of O/L examinations in 2024. This practice will help manage students' time more effectively and provide teachers with ample time to cover the A/L syllabus.
