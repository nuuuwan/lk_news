Sri Lanka moves to ban ‘Happy Hour’ leave hotels staggered

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s hotels have protested a move by the island’s alcohol and tobacco control agency to ban the ‘Happy Hour’, with the threat to fine each director 50,000 rupees if discounts are offered on alcohol.

“It is serious matter for the industry,” Tourist Hotels Association of Sri Lanka President M Shanthikumar said.

“The Happy Hour is not only found in Sri Lanka. It is across the world.”

The National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol had informed a city hotel that received complaints that hotels were offering discounts on drinks during ‘Happy Hour’ promotions.

The practice was viewed as a violation of the NATA Act, the agency had decided to direct all hotels to stop giving discounts on alcohol.

Each director will be fined 50,000 rupees if hotels continued to make customers happy with discounts.

Shanthikumar said representations have been made to the Sri Lanka Tourist Development Authority to help resolve the crisis.

“We have also written to the State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe,” he said.
