Price of tea fertilizer bag reduced by Rs. 4,000 as subsidy program re-implemented

The Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries has re-implemented the fertilizer subsidy program aimed at reducing costs for tea cultivators in Sri Lanka.

As part of this initiative, the Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries has taken steps to reduce the prices of five key fertilizer types produced by the State Fertilizer Company.

Under this program, the cost of a 50kg bag of tea fertilizer has been reduced by Rs. 4,000, offering substantial relief to tea planters across the country.

The fertilizer types subjected to this price reduction include T 200, T 750, U 709, U 834, and T 65.

With a total investment of Rs. 2,400 million, this subsidy program is fully funded by the Sri Lanka Tea Board, ensuring that no government funds are utilized, Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Mahinda Amaraweera said.
