Namal aims to create 2 million jobs within next decade

The Presidential candidate of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), Namal Rajapaksa says that he has a plan to generate 2 million new employment opportunities within the next decade.

Speaking at a public rally in Matale, the SLLP’s presidential candidate said that he would transform the country’s administrative systems to eliminate “the era of long queues” and emphasized that in the future, people in the country including the youth would no longer have to wait in queues for passports, NICs, driver’s licenses and such.

“We will remove fraud and corruption from the election stage,” he added.

He said they will get rid of that with technology and by introducing competitive bidding systems from the procurement method to the tender procedure, and that they will work to create a programme that ensures the protection of transparency and quality through it, together with that technology.

“We are dealing with the world. We are dealing to secure the economy of the parents and children who have their feet on this motherland. It can either be the information technology sector, investment and production sector, service sector, or foreign employment sector. I will take the challenge of creating two million jobs for your child in the next 10 years,” Rajapaksa pledged.
