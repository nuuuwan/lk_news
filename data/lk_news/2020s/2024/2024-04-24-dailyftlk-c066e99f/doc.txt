Citizen’s movement calls for Rs. 50 m compensation over new Electricity Bill

The Citizen’s movement against fraud, corruption and waste has submitted a letter of demand to the Power and Energy Ministry Secretary, calling for Rs. 50 million in compensation.

They cited the adverse effects of the new Sri Lanka Electricity Bill on the citizens as the basis for their claim.

Led by its Chairman Jamuni Kamantha Thushara along with a few other members, the movement argued that the Bill violates Constitutional rights and has a detrimental impact on over 6 million electricity users countrywide.

On 17 April, the Government published the proposed electricity sector reforms in the gazette, which is now named the Sri Lanka Electricity Bill. The crucial legislation is now set to be presented to Parliament during the next sitting. It then allows the public a two-week window from the date of its submission in Parliament to challenge its legality in the Supreme Court.
