Anura Kumara explains why only NPP engages in principled politics

The Presidential Candidate of the National People’s Power (NPP), Anura Kumara Dissanayake claims that the NPP is the only political party with principled politics.

Speaking at a public rally held in Kegalle, he criticized the current political culture in Sri Lanka emphasizing that such an “ugly” and “shameful” politics cannot be seen anywhere else in the world.

“We want to stop this ugly political gambling. What has happened in the politics of Sri Lanka so far? When an election comes, they jump here and there. They take from here and there. What kind of cheap politics exists in Sri Lanka? Nowhere else in the world is there such extremely ugly and shameful politics. Now look at what is happening on Sajith’s stage and Ranil’s stage.”

“That’s why even during the election period, only the National People’s Power (NPP) has principled politics,” he added.

He further emphasized that, unlike other political parties, the NPP is the only party that has avoided accepting any parliamentarians responsible for criminal activities, corruption, espousing racism or representing extremist camps.

Dissanayake urges people to consider these facts when choosing who to vote for. He promised that a victory on September 21 would lead to significant amendments to the constitution and he further assured that if someone switched political parties, they would lose their MP position.
