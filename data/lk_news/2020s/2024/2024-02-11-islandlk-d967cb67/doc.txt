Lyceum Campus launches BEd Hons in Primary Education

The Lyceum Education Group has launched the Bachelor of Education Honours in Primary Education, designed for both students and educators driven by a passion to elevate their teaching careers and delve deeper into the essence of effective teaching.

Dr.Mohan Lal Grero, the Founder of Lyceum International School and the Deputy President of the Lyceum Campus said. “I assure you that the Bachelor of Education Honours in Primary Education is not a traditional degree programme, but I see it more as a manual that helps breakdown the intricacies of teaching methods and make it more digestible to future teachers and students. One of the main highlights of this qualification is the ‘Teaching Practicum” which is a practical component embedded in the programme structure designed to develop the skills of the students. It consists of a paid internship that is scattered throughout the duration of the programme where students will have the unique opportunity to work as teachers in one of the Lyceum Leaf schools during the fourth, seventh and eighth semesters of the programme.”

Students with three passes in A/L in any stream can enrol in the BEd Hons (Primary Education). The programme has been recognized by the University Grant Commission (UGC), placing it as one of the most recognized teaching qualifications in the country and overseas.
