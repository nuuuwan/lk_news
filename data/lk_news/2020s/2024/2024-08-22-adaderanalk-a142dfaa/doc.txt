Sajith reiterates plans to amend IMF agreement after winning presidential poll

The presidential candidate of the ‘Samagi Jana Sandhanaya’, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa reiterated his stance of amending Sri Lanka’s agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) following his election to the Office of the President, citing that the existing agreement does not focus on economic growth.

Addressing the National Visionary Summit in Colombo, organized by the National Council of Professionals, the Opposition Leader expressed his view that a government should not only focus on debt sustainability, adding that attention is also needed to be paid to other areas including trade.

Commenting further, Premadasa stated that a mere 3.1% economic growth by 2029, which is agreed by the IMF and the Sri Lankan Government is insufficient, highlighting that debt sustainability cannot be the sole focus.

“We must align our economy towards growth, not just growth, but tradable growth. It is a must to ensure that we achieve shared prosperity”, he added.

“The Samagi Jana Balawegaya is committed to continue with the reform process”, Premadasa emphasized.
