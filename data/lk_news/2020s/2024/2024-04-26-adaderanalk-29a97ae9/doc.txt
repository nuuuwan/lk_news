Verdict on MSD director’s bail request deferred to next week

The Court of Appeal has deferred the verdict on the bail request made by the Director of Medical Supplies Division (MSD) Dr. Kapila Wickramanayake.

Thereby, the decision on the bail request, which was slated to be delivered today by Appeals Court judge D.N. Samarakoon, is expected on 30 April.

Wickramanayake is currently held in remand custody over the alleged substandard immunoglobulin imports case. He had filed the petition through his lawyers, seeking an order that the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court’s decision to remand him to be declared unlawful and therefore, to release him on bail.

On 20 November 2023, four high-ranking officials – MSD Director Dr. Wickramanayake, Assistant Director Devashantha Soloman, Accountant (Supplies) Neran Dhananjaya and the Stock Controller of the Medical Supplies Division Sujith Kumara – were arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID).

The other accused in the case are former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, former Health Secretary Janaka Chandragupta, Additional Health Secretary Dr. Saman Ratnayake and the owner of the company which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of IVIG vials.
