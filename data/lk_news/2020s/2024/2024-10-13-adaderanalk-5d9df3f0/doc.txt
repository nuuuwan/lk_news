Cinnamon Air to launch cross-country domestic flights in Sri Lanka

Sri Lankan domestic airline Cinnamon Air has recently announced the launch of two new daily scheduled flights connecting Kandy and Sigiriya with South Coast destinations Koggala and Hambantota.

These flights are set to commence on November 01, 2024 and will operate until April 30, 2025.

The flights are strategically timed to cater to the influx of foreign travellers during the winter holiday season.

These cross-country flights are designed to enhance convenience and reduce travel time while ensuring an unparalleled experience for those who wish to explore Sri Lanka’s South Coast after visiting the Cultural Triangle or the Central Hill Country.

The routes are serviced by Cinnamon Air’s fleet of Cessna 208 aircraft, and the route from Kandy to the South coast is served by the amphibian variation, offering a unique travel experience involving taking off on water.
