‘Port City Colombo provides investors two primary options of investment: land development investments, which include residential and commercial property development, and business set-up and investments, which encompass a variety of opportunities in IT/ITes, financial services, hospitality/tourism, logistics, and so forth. Commercial entities, who are interested in investing or setting up business operations, are required to become qualified as an Authorised Person, which is defined as any individual or entity permitted by the Colombo Port City Economic Commission (CPCEC) to conduct business within the vicinity and from the area of authority of the Colombo Port City Special Economic Zone.
