Advantis Project Logistics supports climate-smart agriculture initiatives

Exemplifying exceptional environmental stewardship, Advantis – Project Logistics, a subsidiary of the Advantis Group, the transportation and logistics arm of Hayleys PLC, completed the rehabilitation of multiple water tanks as a part of the Climate Smart Irrigated Agriculture Projects (CSIAPs). The CSIAP has not only increased agricultural productivity but also conserved water resources, promoting sustainable farming in areas most vulnerable to climate change. This initiative aims to improve climate resilience in dry zones while augmenting water supply for agricultural purposes.

As a dynamic project logistics company offering a multitude of services across industries, the Unit has demonstrated its versatility and diversification by extending construction support to various irrigation projects. Notably, the involvement encompasses major initiatives such as the Uma Oya Multi-Purpose project, the Upper Elahera Canal project, and several others. In a natural evolution of the Unit’s capabilities, Advantis – Project Logistics distinguishes itself with its robust strengths in climate-smart irrigation technology and unmatched expertise, playing a pivotal role in ensuring the seamless completion of projects that adhere to high-quality construction standards.

This commitment extends beyond technology, encompassing quality construction standards that underpin the durability and longevity of these projects. The Unit oversees every aspect of the process, from the initial stages to the final distribution of water supply, aiming to not only provide construction support but also to make a meaningful contribution to community well-being and sustainable development. Through the integration of advanced sensors, data analytics, and precision control mechanisms, the Company not only ensured project success but also facilitated an opportunity for enhanced food security, marking a significant stride in advancing agricultural sustainability.
