Sri Lanka looking to create national wealth fund

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka plans to establish a national wealth fund using government assets, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said.

“There are plans to establish a national wealth fund using government assets, similar to investment companies created by countries like Norway, Qatar, and Singapore, where profits from government revenues are used for public welfare,” Wickremesinghe was quoted as saying by his media division.

“Traditionally, the funds from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) and Employees’ Trust Fund (ETF) were used to purchase bonds. However, under our current program, government spending has been reduced, and plans are in place to increase state revenues,” Wickremesinghe said speaking at the launch of a retirement insurance system by Sanasa held in Colombo on Monday.

“As revenues grow, the need to use provident fund money for bond purchases will diminish. We are in discussions to redirect these funds towards investment opportunities, and we intend to consult with trade unions and employers on this matter.”

New laws will be required to support these efforts, Wickremesinghe said, which would draw inspiration from existing legislation in countries like Denmark and Sweden. “These laws will also address investments and retirement plans.” (Colombo/Sep3/2024)
