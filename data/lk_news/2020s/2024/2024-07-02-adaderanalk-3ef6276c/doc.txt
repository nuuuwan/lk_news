UNDP’s local governance symposium recommendations handed over to Prime Minister

The Findings and Preliminary Recommendations Report from the recently concluded National Symposium on ‘Catalysing Change: Making Local Governance Future Fit’ carried out by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been handed over this morning (02) to Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena.

The report was officially handed over by Ms. Azusa Kubota, Resident Representative, UNDP in Sri Lanka and Mr. Johann Hesse, Head of Cooperation at the European Union (EU) Delegation to Sri Lanka and the Maldives.

The National Symposium was co-convened by the Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government, the European Union Delegation in Sri Lanka and the UNDP in Sri Lanka.

The dialogue created a platform to foster productive exchanges of insights and best practices among stakeholders concerning local governance, drawing extensively from the lessons and experiences gained over 5 years, working alongside 134 local authorities in 4 Provinces in the country through the Capacity Development of Local Government (CDLG) Project, funded by the European Union.

The report is informed by the experience of experts, practitioners, and multiple stakeholders that participated, and will aim to inform the shaping of the future trajectory of governance in Sri Lanka, ensuring it remains adaptive, resilient, and well-positioned to meet the challenges of tomorrow’s development landscape, according to the UNDP.
