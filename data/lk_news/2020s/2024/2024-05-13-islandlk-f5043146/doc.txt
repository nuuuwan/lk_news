Share market hit by parliament dissolution apprehensions

The stock market yesterday witnessed selling pressure due to political uncertainty stemming from the possibility of parliament being dissolved and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s statement urging the government not to divest state owned enterprises until elections are over, market analysts said.

Consequently, both indices moved downwards. The All Share Price Index went down by 11.06 points while S and P SL20 declined by 3.79 points. Turnover stood at Rs 1.79 billion with three crossings.
