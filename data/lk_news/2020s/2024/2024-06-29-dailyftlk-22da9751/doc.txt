NDB announces Araliya Savings Account promotion

NDB Bank has announced the NDB Araliya Promotion 2024, running until 31 July under the theme ‘Save and Be Gifted’.

This special campaign continues the bank’s tradition of empowering women by encouraging them to save and invest in their futures, offering exclusive rewards as a token of appreciation for their trust and commitment.

The NDB Araliya savings account, designed specifically for women, aligns with the bank’s commitment to promoting female participation in the economic and social sectors. Through this initiative, NDB Bank aims to provide women with the financial tools and support necessary to achieve their personal and professional goals, reinforcing the bank’s dedication to empowering women in all their endeavours.

During this promotion, new customers who open an NDB Araliya account with a minimum deposit of Rs. 15,000 and a deposit of Rs. 25,000 will receive exclusive Araliya-branded gifts. These incentives not only encourage savings but also demonstrate NDB Bank’s appreciation for its female customers’ contributions to the economy and society.

NDB Araliya is more than just a savings account – it is a comprehensive financial solution tailored to meet the unique needs of women. Account holders benefit from higher interest rates, free life protection cover of up to Rs. 1,000,000 for the account holder and their family, and free hospitalisation cover. Additionally, the account includes special provisions such as a free Shilpa savings account at childbirth with a maximum deposit of Rs. 25,000, ensuring that both mothers and their children have a secure financial future.

This campaign underscores NDB Bank’s vision of fostering financial independence among women and providing them with opportunities to develop their skills and talents. The bank’s ongoing initiatives, including the NDB Araliya Promotion, highlight its commitment to creating a supportive environment where women can thrive and succeed.

NDB Bank continues to recognise and celebrate the vital role women play in society. Despite the global changes that have enabled women to take the lead in various corporate and economic sectors, Sri Lankan women still face challenges that deter their active participation. The NDB Araliya platform stands as a testament to the bank’s dedication to overcoming these barriers and promoting female advancement.
