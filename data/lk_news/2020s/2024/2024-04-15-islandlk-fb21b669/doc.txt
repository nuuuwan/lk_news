Words…coming out strong

Yes, golden words, indeed, from Chandral Fonseka, leader of the group Kings, who celebrated his 69th birthday on Saturday, 30th March.

Says Chandral: “I am 69 and still very much active in the music field. I have no enemies in this world but only friends.

In three Facebook accounts, I have 15,000 friends. Most of them are interacting with me often. I have 4000 contacts on my mobile. I always respond to their posts or calls.

“I have always played music with better musicians than me and gained a lot of insight from them before becoming a leader myself.

I have learned to give due respect to people where it is due. I have learned to live a righteous life in a corrupted world. I love to do good, but prefer to do the right thing always.

I am learning new things daily. I apply Biblical insight to my daily life. 69 years is long and my happy moments are greater than the sad times.

“I have never pulled a musician out of another band when there is a vacancy in my band and always taken someone who is free.

I believe perfect ear is a blessing. I have more friends than money in this world. I count all these as God’s grace.

“Thank you all for sending me greetings and may your day also be a blessed one.”

Kings, with Chandral, are seen regularly at various functions, and they have regularly weekly dates at the Hilton, as well.
