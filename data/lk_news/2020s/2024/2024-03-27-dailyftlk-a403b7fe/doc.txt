CIABOC case against Keheliya to go ahead

The Colombo High Court yesterday dismissed the preliminary objections presented by the counsels representing former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella in a case brought by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) against him for criminal misappropriation of funds during his tenure as the Minister of Mass Media.

The two defendants in the case, including Rambukwella, stand accused of misappropriating Rs. 230948 from the State Printing Corporation to settle Rambukwellaâ€™s personal telephone bill during the period from March to April 2012, when he served as the Minister of Mass Media.

When the case was called before the Colombo High Court yesterday the defence counsel argued that the case could not be maintained and therefore requested it to be dismissed. However, Colombo High Court Judge Damith Thotawatte permitted the case against Rambukwella and the former chairman of the State Printing Corporation, Jayampathi Bandara Heenkenda, to proceed.

Rambukwella, who is presently in remand custody regarding the acquisition of substandard human immunoglobulin vials, was also present for the court proceedings. The further hearing of the case has been adjourned to 22 July.

Indictments were filed against Rambukwella and Heenkenda by CIABOC in September 2022.
