2024 sees drop in dengue cases, deaths compared to previous years

State Minister of Health Dr. Seetha Arambepola says that 2024 has seen a decrease in the number of dengue cases and mortality rates compared to previous years.

Highlighting the progress, she noted that while 64 dengue-prone areas were identified by January, the authorities have successfully managed to mitigate risks in two zones as of today.

These remarks were made by Dr. Arambepola during her participation in a press briefing at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) today (05).

Every year, accidents stemming from the unsafe handling of fireworks mar the festive season. Thus, a plea is made for vigilance and caution with loved ones during this New Year period.

Additionally, in the preceding season, concerted efforts were made to raise awareness about dengue prevention. Gratitude is owed to health departments and media outlets for their significant contributions. Notably, compared to previous years, there has been a marked reduction in both dengue cases and fatalities.

In January, there were 64 identified dengue hotspots. Presently, efforts have successfully brought under control two of these regions. Initially, over a thousand cases were reported, a number that has dwindled to 200 today. Climate conditions have undoubtedly played a role in this trajectory.

From January to date, 20,365 dengue cases have been documented, with 7,289 originating from the Western Province alone. The unfortunate toll stands at only eight deaths in the year 2024.

Moreover, a proactive program is currently underway to preempt potential epidemic scenarios. Its efficacy in averting such crises cannot be overstated.
