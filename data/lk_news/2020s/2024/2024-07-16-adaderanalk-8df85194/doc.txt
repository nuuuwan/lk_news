Fairly heavy showers and strong winds expected in parts of the country

The Department of Meteorology says the prevailing windy conditions over the island are expected to continue further, due to the active Southwest Monsoon conditions.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in Western, Sabaragamuwa and North-western provinces and in Kandy, Nuwara-Eliya, Galle and Matara districts.

Fairly heavy showers about 75 mm are likely at some places in Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces and in Kandy, Nuwara-Eliya, Galle and Matara districts.

Strong winds of about 50-60 kmph can be expected at times over Western slopes of the central hills and in Northern, North-central and North-western provinces and in Trincomalee, Monaragala and Hambantota districts.

Fairly strong winds about 30-40 kmph can be expected at times elsewhere of the island.
