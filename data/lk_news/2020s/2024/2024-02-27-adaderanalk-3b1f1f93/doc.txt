Health capacities at BIA, Colombo Port to be improved under Japanese grant

The Cabinet of Ministers has given the go-ahead to a proposal seeking to upgrade the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake and the Colombo Port to be on par with the international practices, recommendations and standards under a grant provided by Japan.

As Sri Lankaâ€™s economy is mainly dependent on the income generated from international tourism and business travel, the government says this requires smooth operation of entry points into the country, building confidence among travellers and arranging cross-border entry points to comply with international health regulations on movement.

Government of Japan has provided a grant of Yen 1.17 billion through the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to further strengthen border-related health preparedness at points of entry, direct contribution to the control of infectious diseases and the overall security of all passengers, staff and staff at points of entry during health emergencies.

Under the grant, the facilities of BIA, Colombo Port and the Maldives International Airport are planned to be upgraded.

As such the Cabinet of Ministers approved the proposal presented by the Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation to implement the relevant project in tandem with the Ministry of Health, Department of Immigration, Airports and Air Services Company and Sri Lanka Port Authority.
