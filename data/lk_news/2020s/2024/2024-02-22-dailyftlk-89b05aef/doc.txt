Met. Dept. warns public on heat index in several districts

The Meteorology Department issued a warning yesterday cautioning residents about the rising heat index, which measures the temperature felt on the human body.

According to the department, the heat index is expected to escalate to ‘Caution’ levels in several areas, particularly in the North-Western Province and districts including Gampaha, Colombo, Hambantota and Monaragala.

The advisory underscores the potential for discomfort and health risks associated with high heat index levels. Residents in the mentioned areas are advised to take precautionary measures to stay cool and hydrated, especially during the peak heat hours of the day.

The warning serves as a reminder for individuals to avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight, seek shade when outdoors, and drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration. Additionally, vulnerable populations such as the elderly, children, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions are urged to take extra precautions to avoid heat-related illnesses.
