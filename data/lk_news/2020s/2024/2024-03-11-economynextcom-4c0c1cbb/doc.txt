Opposition wanted meeting with Sri Lanka bondholders, not IMF: Harsha

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya asked for a meeting with bondholders with whom restructuring talks are underway and not the International Monetary Fund, which was offered by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, a legislator said.

Opposition legislator Harsha de Silva said he asked in parliament for a meeting with bond holders in the presence of President Wickremesinghe, since any deal made by the current administration will commit the opposition which come to power.

If Sri Lanka strikes a deal with foreign bond holders which cannot be implement, the country can go for a second default, he said.

“What I said was that to come to an agreement with bond holders in a transparent way with the agreement of opposition parties,” De Silva said.

“What was meant was not for the agreement to be brought parliament and approved by the 113 majority saying everyone is agreed.

“What I said was to bring opposition also to a place where they can bear the responsibility. There is another group with Anura Dissanayake. I am of the view that they should also be part of that responsibility.”

Instead President Wickremesinghe had offered a meeting with the IMF. The IMF in any case met the main opposition and other representatives.

The agreement with the IMF was done, though the SJB hoped to make changes if they came to power.

“We did not ask a meeting with the IMF,” de Silva told reporters.
