Sri Lanka state workers, military given Rs107bn in April salaries

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Treasury has released 107 billion rupees to state workers for April salaries including an increment, State Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

The monthly salary bill is about 93 billion rupees, but it has gone up by about 13 billion rupees due to the 10,000 rupee allowance, he said.

Usually the monthly salaries are paid starting from the 16 and 17. First teachers are paid, then the military the next day, followed by provincial councils, he said.

“But for April we paid before the New Year,” Minister Siyambalapitiya said. “So today the Treasury released the funds to all state institutions.”

“Tomorrow everyone should get their salaries, to their accounts or otherwise”.

Colombo-based Verite Research analysis of expenditure found that 32 percent of the salaries go to the military and another 16 percent went to the public security ministry.

The health salary bill was only 17 percent of the total, and education only 9 percent.

President Ranil Wcikremesinghe’s budget speech for 2024 outlined that the cost of living allowance which sat at 7,800 rupees, was to be increased by 10,000 rupees to 17,800 rupees in January 2024. (Colombo/Apr9/2024)
