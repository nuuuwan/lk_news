Ex-MP Sri Ranga to give statement to CID on Sujeewa’s vehicle

Former Member of Parliament J. Sri Ranga has arrived at the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) this morning in order to provide a statement.

The former MP is to provide a statement in relation to former MP Sujeewa Senasinghe’s luxury vehicle, worth around Rs. 100 million, which is suspected to have been illegally assembled.

On November 11, the Fort Magistrate’s Court had ordered the CID to take former MP Sujeewa Senasinghe’s vehicle into custody and produce it to the Government Analyst’s Department and obtain a report.
