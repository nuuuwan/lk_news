Sri Lanka to issue 30-day single entry tourist visa below 100 dollars

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will issue a cheaper 30-day single entry visa for a lower cost, Public Security Minister Tiran Alles said, as the tourist sector was hit by 100 dollar visa with a shift of visa processing to a private contractor.

Sri Lanka issued a multiple entry visa for 50 dollar final prices before the shift to IVS-GBS VFS Global group, when the visa went up to 100.77 with 18.50 fee and convenience fee on top of the gazette 75 dollar price.

“The 30 day visa with single entry was at 50 dollars,” Minister Alles told reporters in Colombo Monday as the crisis escalated.

“However, when we passed it, it was removed from the document, and subsequently from the system.”

It is not clear whether the IVS-GBS VFS Global group will also charge an 18.50 fee and the convenience fee on top of the 50 dollars.

Minister Alles told reporters that the cabinet was free to decided on the price of the visa, or a free visa but when the private platform was used, its service fees had to be paid.

Based on fees charged by the private contractors, a ’50 dollar visa’ could cost around 73 to dollars or little more.

However Tourism Minister Harin Fernado said the 50 dollar single entry visa would be 50 dollars ‘all inclusive’

3. As mentioned from the beginning, on the 7th May onwards a 30-day single-entry visa without all inclusive at $50 until our proposal for free visas for more than 50 countries is finalized. Till then 7 counties will enjoy free visa as before. @sajithpremadasa

The tourist industry has said fast growing East Asian nations charge lower fees of around 25 to 40 dollars or no fee for tourists and are getting millions of visitors.

Sri Lanka may miss the 2.3 million tourism target for 2024 as result of the new website.

Earlier, Sri Lanka was charging 50 dollars for issuing visa through a simple interface on the Department of Immigration website, which had drawn acclaim for its simplicity and ease of use.

The opposition has called for an investigation to find out why the IVS-GBS VFS Global is charging such high fees from tourists.
