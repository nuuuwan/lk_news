Nurses’ union decides not to join trade union action

The All Ceylon Nurses’ Union stated they will not be joining the public sector employees’ trade union action scheduled to be carried out tomorrow (08) and the day after (09).

The General Secretary of the union H. M. S. B. Mediwatta has stated that implementing strikes would cause inconveniences to the patients and the people of the country.

He further stated that despite existing issues in the health sector, this is not an appropriate time for strikes and also he warned that they would support the public at the earliest opportunity to help oust the government.
