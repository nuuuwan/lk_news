Non-appointment of Bribery Commission DG challenged in SC

Colombo, March 27 (Daily Mirror) - The Commissioner General of Land, Bandula Jayasinghe yesterday challenged an indictment filed by the Bribery Commission against him on the premise that no Director General has been appointed thus far by the President.

When the writ application was taken up for support in the Supreme Court, Counsel Hafeel Farisz appearing for the Commissioner General told court that there was no Director General currently enforced by the Bribery Commission under the Anti-Corruption Act.

Counsel submitted to court that the Anti-Corruption Act completely repealed the previous law and there was no provision for the continuation of the office of the Director General.

He further stated that the person acting as the Director General was appointed under the previous act and that there is no approval by the President and the Constitutional Council for the previous holder to continue in the position of the officer.

The Commissioner of Land and six others were indicted before the High Court of Colombo on an illegal transfer of a car.

The Supreme Court comprising Justice Preeti Padman Surasena, Justice Shiran Gooneratne and Mahinda Samayawardena fixed the matter to be heard on top of the list on June 4, 2024.

Counsel Hafeel Farisz with Shannon Tillekeratne appeared for the Petitioner. Director Solicitor General Shanil Kularatne appeared for the Attorney General.
