Police to launch CCTV-based traffic violation identification programme on Monday

Colombo, Jan 18 (Daily Mirror) - A programme aimed at identifying motorists violating traffic rules through the CCTV system in Colombo city is set to commence on January 22, Acting IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon said.

He explained that video evidence of relevant offenses captured by the traffic division's CCTV system will be forwarded to the respective police station and fine papers for the offenses will be issued to the drivers.

Acting IGP Tennakoon said that while traffic police officers may identify a minimum number of violations during road duty, CCTV examination had revealed a staggering increase of over 300% in offenses occurring at specific locations compared to manual observations.

Emphasizing the technology's role in impartially identifying traffic violators, Tennakoon said that action will be taken against offenders regardless of their professions.

The programme is set to be initiated in Colombo, issuing fine tickets at the nearest police station based on the owner identification via the vehicle number plates.
