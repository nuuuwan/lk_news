Prime Minister issues clarification on Presidential Election

Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena has confirmed that the Presidential Election will be held in accordance with the Constitution and on the date specified by the Election Commission.

He made these comments while responding to questions from journalists after attending the opening of the Martin Wickramasinghe Hall of Life section at the National Library and Documentation Services Board today (29).

“The government’s stand on the election has already been announced. The Election Commission declared that the presidential election can be held according to the constitution.”

“They have announced that it will be scheduled between the months of September and October. The government has also announced that,” he said.

Replying to a question on allegations that the government is trying to postpone the election after seeing the crowd for its May Day, the Premier said:

“No political decision will be taken after seeing a crowd. We will not be panicked or reversed, but will move forward.”

He added: “Steps have been taken according to the accepted election law for the development of the country by advancing the supreme parliamentary system and the people’s mandate. There is a two-thirds system that is very difficult to be followed to change the election rules. Otherwise, the parliament can go on until next August. If necessary it can be dissolved earlier. Or they can dissolve it by themselves. There is a system in the constitution to do so.

“After the Presidential election, it will be the general election. Later, attention has been paid on holding provincial council and local government elections at the same time.

“Some people declare various things without responsibility. I am telling the countrymen that a Democratic government or parliament will not allow the government to make sudden announcements about something that has not been discussed in any situation and to create unrest in the country irresponsibly.”

“The Election Commission has the power to call the Presidential election, according to the Constitution. It cannot be called in advance or later. It has been fixed in the constitution. Accordingly, the Election Commission will conduct the election as scheduled.”
