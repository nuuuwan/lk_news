No bus fare revision at this time, potential switch to super diesel if price decreases further: Gemunu

Colombo, April 1 (Daily Mirror) - Since there hasn't been a price revision for Lanka Auto Diesel, it is not possible to consider a bus fare revision right now, but if the prices of Lanka Super Diesel decrease further, they may be able to switch to using it, Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA) president Gemunu Wijerathne said.

Addressing the media today, he said private buses are operating while incuring a loss of Rs. 28 and eventhough the Lanka Auto Diesel price was reuced by Rs. 50, they are unable to reduce private bus fares.

"Despite the fuel price revision, the current increase in diesel prices has not exceeded 4%. We couldn't raise bus fares even when the price of Lanka Auto Diesel went up by Rs. 28," he said.

Wijerathne thanked the government for its efforts to lower the price of Lanka Super Diesel, which supports the country's eco-friendly initiatives. He mentioned that further reductions in Lanka Super Diesel prices would enable them to use it and operate buses as part of eco-friendly measures.

"The national policy on bus fare revision is scheduled for July, and the association is hoping to provide relief to the public. This decision will come into effiect by the prevailing dollar rate, as well as the decrease in prices of essential goods in the market, along with reductions in bus accessories, repairs, spare parts and service charges," he said.
