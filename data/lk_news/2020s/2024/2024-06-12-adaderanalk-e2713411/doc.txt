Court further extends injunction against ex-President Maithripala

The Colombo District Court has extended the interim injunction issued preventing former President Maithripala Sirisena functioning as the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) until June 19, 2024, Ada Derana reporter said.

This order was issued when a plaint filed by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was taken up for consideration before the court today (12).

On April 04, the Colombo District Court issued an enjoining order preventing former President Maithripala Sirisena from functioning as the SLFP chairman.

However on May 12, the former President resigned from the post of Chairman of the SLFP, following which the faction of the SLFP led by Sirisena appointed Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe as the new Chairman of the party.
