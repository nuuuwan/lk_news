Chinese support for Sri Lanka’s agricultural and industrial development

A prominent Chinese delegation is actively engaging in studies and discussions with various stakeholders, particularly in Sri Lanka’s agricultural and industrial sectors. It has pledged its support to bolster Sri Lanka’s economy, a senior Sri Lankan state official said.

According to this official who spoke to The Island Financial Review, while some members have concluded their crucial discussions and departed, others remain, eager to forge additional business ties with the island nation.

The delegation, representing the China Association of Small and Medium-Scale Commercial Enterprises, also held discussions with Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries Mahinda Amraweera.

The official noted that this association currently stands as the largest representative body for small and medium scale enterprises in China. The delegation, spearheaded by Zhingong Borui, chairman of the Technology Development Co. Ltd (Beijing), expressed its readiness to provide technical assistance for the cultivation of fruits and vegetables—particularly pineapples and bananas—in Sri Lanka.

Furthermore, the delegation aims to enhance tea cultivation and facilitate the export of these products to China. Borui assured Amaraweera of the delegation’s willingness to support any proposals put forth by the Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industry.

Amaraweera highlighted the increasing interest from various countries to invest in Sri Lanka. He credited the successful expansion of investment opportunities in Sri Lanka to the government’s efforts, led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Amaraweera requested the delegation to submit proposals outlining agricultural and animal husbandry programs to be implemented in Sri Lanka by the China Small and Medium-Scale Commercial Association. Additionally, he urged for technical assistance to boost milk, egg and meat production in Sri Lanka.
