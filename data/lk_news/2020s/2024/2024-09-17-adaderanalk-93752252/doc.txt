Investigation into possible Grade 5 Scholarship Exam paper leak

The Commissioner General of Examinations Amit Jayasundara says that investigations are to be held tomorrow (18) into an incident where three questions similar to those on the Grade 5 Scholarship exam paper had allegedly been posted online via a model exam paper.

Speaking to Ada Derana, he stated that if investigations uncover that the questions have in fact been leaked, these questions would be disregarded during the paper marking process.

He said that an investigation was conducted based on the information received alleging that a teacher in the Alawwa area had uploaded a model question paper to social media which had included three questions similar to three questions in the first paper of the Grade 5 Scholarship Exam.

Accordingly, the committee that had prepared the question paper of the scholarship examination was convened today for a discussion, and it was decided to remove the three related questions.

The Exams Chief stated that a team of investigative officers will travel to the relevant area tomorrow (18) to conduct an inquiry in this regard and a final decision will be taken after their report is received.
