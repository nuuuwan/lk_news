Lady picking pockets-symptoms of wider social malaise - EDITORIAL

Two days ago this newspaper highlighted the story of a Woman Police Constable (WPC) being arrested for picking the handbag of a shopper in Kandy. Not many of us citizens were shocked or dumbfounded. After all, this was ‘merely’ a case of a so-called ‘law keeper’ breaking a law.

We as a nation know how our country’s leaders brought our people and the nation to a position of bankruptcy through corrupt practices. The political leaders of this country are not much different from political leaders in even the richest country in the world.

During the era of prohibition in the United States, the infamous US criminal Al Capone rose to success on the back of the Temperance Movement. On January 16, 1919 prohibition was passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives.

Did America go dry and sober? NO. The opposite happened. The sudden non availability of liquor helped create an organised illegal manufacturing, smuggling and distribution network of alcohol and the growth of a strong mafia with enormous resources to work with.

Money flowed to the leaders of the gangs, who used these resources to defend and expand their territories through violence and bribery. Shootings were commonplace. Bought-off police and politicians kept the long arm of the law at bay. The system of justice from New York to Chicago was held captive by a mafia.

In our own country as in all parts of the world corruption was and continues to be prevalent. However, big-time corrupt practices commenced with the introduction of the open economic policies introduced in 1977. Then Premier JR Jayewardene who later became president in an open invitation said “Let the robber barons come”.

And come they did, from law makers to petty clerks and bureaucrats, to guardians of the law, the robber barons spread their tentacles via their filthy lucre. Stories of government ministers holding extents of land and wealth abroad were well known. It was not long before it spread to the populace at large. Soon no government service could be obtained unless ‘gifts’ changed hands. Even the judiciary was silenced with daylight attacks on the homes of judges.

While ordinary citizens were prosecuted for petty crimes the big sharks were free to roam the seas so to say. A classic example was how relief funds at the time of the Tsunami disaster were transferred to a private account. Though exposed no action was taken against the fraudster-corruption ruled. Since then our country has seen many a scam perpetrated and billions of dollars illegally leave the country’s shores.

The recent arrest of a woman police constable for picking pockets is a different kettle of fish altogether. It is not a corrupt practice per se. It is a petty crime.

What makes a respected officer stoop to the level of a thief?

‘salary.lk’ reveals an average police officer receives an income ranging between Rs. 20,666 to Rs. 59,686 per month. Most of the lower-ranked khaki-clad brethren come from deprived low-income backgrounds with large families who look to them for support.

During the past two to three weeks this paper has kept highlighting, that it costs over Rs. 150,000 per month for a family of four to have just two nutritious meals per day. This sum does not take into account children’s education, medical care, clothing or other basics.

The story of the WPC accused of picking pockets brings to mind the novel ‘Les Misérables’ set during the French Revolution, where an accused is sentenced to prison for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister’s sick and hungry son.

The event highlights the desperation and inequality faced by deprived sections of our community. Sometimes theft is born out of necessity.

We do not defend the action of the WPC. But her actions point to a very serious problem facing a large section of people in our country -inadequate income to cover the cost of living.

Not a good situation if one hopes to be successful at polls expected to be held toward the end of the year.
