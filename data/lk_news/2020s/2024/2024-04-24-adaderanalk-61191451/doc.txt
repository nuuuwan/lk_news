Damitha Abeyratne and husband granted bail

Actress Damitha Abeyratne and her husband were granted bail on the orders of the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday (24).

Accordingly, the couple was released on surety bonds of Rs. 5 million each.

The actress and her spouse, who had been wanted by the CID, were arrested on 04 April after they appeared before the court and were kept in remand custody.

The CID is investigating Abeyratne and her husband, in connection with their involvement in an alleged money scam.

The Computer Crimes Division of the CID initiated an investigation into the alleged defrauding of Rs. 3 million by the couple on the promise of employment in South Korea. Subsequently, the CID informed the court that Abeyratne and her husband would be named as suspects of the relevant case.

Fort Magistrate’s Court also rejected a writ petition looking to prevent their arrest.
