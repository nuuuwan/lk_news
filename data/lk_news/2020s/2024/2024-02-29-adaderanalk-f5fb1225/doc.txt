Former Health Minister Keheliya produced before court

Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella has been produced before the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court, a short while ago.

The former Minister is currently under remand custody over the import of substandard human Immunoglobulin vials.

On 15 February, Rambukwella and six others including former Health Secretary Janaka Chandragupta were remanded until 29 February on orders of the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court.

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Rambukwella on 02 February in connection with the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), when he arrived there, complying with a court order. He had been grilled for nearly 10 hours before being arrested.

The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker.

Prior to the apprehension of Rambukwella, seven arrests had been made in connection with the drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail. As such, the former Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministry’s Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, now remain in custody on remand.
