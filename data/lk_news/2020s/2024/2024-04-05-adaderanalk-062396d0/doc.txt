Six MPs of ‘Nidahasa Janatha Sabhawa’ join SJB-led alliance

The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with a group of members of Freedom People’s Congress (Nidahasa Janatha Sabhawa) as the first step of forming the main opposition-led ‘Samagi Jana Sandhanaya’, a short while ago.

The agreement has been reached based on the discussions carried out for several months regarding the upcoming elections and policy issues.

Accordingly, the agreement has been signed between the SJB and 06 MPs of Nidahasa Janatha Sabhawa including Prof. G.L. Peiris, Dilan Perera, Dr. Nalaka Godahewa, K.P. Kumarasiri, Dr. Upul Galappaththi and Wasantha Yapa Bandara, to form the new alliance.

A group of politicians including the aforementioned who broke away from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) had previously decided to sit independently in Parliament under the Nidahasa Janatha Sabhawa.
