Easter Sunday carnage: Vital aspect ignored

Former Justice Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, who is running for President, has dropped a bombshell. Taking part in a Sirasa TV programme, the other day, he hinted at the possibility of some world powers having had a hand in the Easter Sunday terror attacks, which snuffed out about 270 lives and left more than 500 others injured, in 2019. He said he had opposed the handing over of the strategically important Hambantota Port to China, in 2017, and warned the Yahapalana Cabinet that another world power would seek to take control of the Trincomalee harbour, the oil tank farm near it, and the Colombo Port, and if Sri Lanka did not grant those demands, it would be plunged into a bloodbath and forced into submission.

He said the Yahapalana administration had ignored his warning and gone ahead with the Hambantota Port deal, and three months later his prediction had come true; the US asked for the Trincomalee harbour with 1.2 million acres, and India demanded the Trinco oil tanks and the East Terminal of the Colombo Port be handed over to it. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had sought to grant those demands and presented a bill to Parliament to amend the Land Ordinance, Dr. Rajapakshe said, adding that he had moved the Supreme Court successfully, aborting the Yahapalana  government’s bid to hand over the Trincomalee harbour and 1.2 million acres. That administration’s attempt to grant India’s demand had come a cropper due to protests. A few months later, the Easter Sunday attacks had happened, Dr. Rajapakshe said, drawing parallels between the destabilisation of Sri Lanka and that of Bangladesh.

If one reads between the lines, it is not difficult to figure out what Rajapakshe chose to leave unsaid. He is not alone in suspecting that there was a foreign hand in the 2019 terrorist bombings. We have dealt with this issue in previous editorial comments.

The Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI), which probed the Easter Sunday terror attacks, investigated the alleged foreign involvement in the carnage rather perfunctorily. It has devoted only an eight-page chapter in its bulky report to the alleged foreign hand in the attacks. This particular section in the commission report, in our book, lacks clarity and proper analysis. The witnesses who expressly testified that there had been ‘an external hand or conspiracy behind the attacks’, according to the PCoI report, are Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, former President Maithripala Sirisena, former Minister Rauff Hakeem, former Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, former Governor Azath Salley, SJB MP Mujibur Rahman, former SIS Director SDIG Nilantha Jayawardena, former STF Commandant M. R. Lateef, former Chief of Defence Staff Ravindra Wijegunaratne, former SDIG CID Ravi Seneviratne and former CID Director Shani Abeysekera. Dismissing their statements as mere ipse dixits (assertions made but not proven), the PCoI report has said that no such foreign link was found (p. 472). The probe commission should have dug deeper before arriving at such a conclusion. It has, however, recommended that certain identified parties be further investigated. This has not been done.

We argued, prior to the release of the PCoI report, that it was possible that Zahran and his gang had taken orders from a fake ISIS created by a foreign spy agency. The PCoI has quoted SDIG Jayawardena as saying that an Indian named Abu Hind ‘may have triggered the attacks’: “He [Jayawardena] went on to imply that the intelligence agencies that provided him with the intelligence on 4th, 20th and 21st April 2019 may have had a hand in the attack.” According to the PCoI report, an ‘international expert on terrorism, who testified in camera, said, “Abu Hind was a character created by a section of a provincial Indian intelligence apparatus, and the intelligence that the Director SIS received on the 4th, 20th and 21st April, 2019 was from this operation and the intelligence operative pretending to be one Abu Hind.

Operatives of this outfit operate on social media pretending to be Islamic State figures. They are trained to run virtual personas.” The PCoI report says: “The testimony was that Zahran believed Abu Hind was the Islamic State regional representative. Abu Hind was in touch with both Zahran and his brother, Rilwan, and had spoken to Naufer. This part of the evidence is confirmed by the testimony of Hadiya [Zahran’s wife].” It is mentioned on page 220 of the report that according to the aforesaid international expert, ‘the Indian Central Government was not aware of the intelligence obtained by the provincial outfit’. This, we believe, is a debatable point.

Dr. Rajapakshe was the Justice Minister in the Yahapalana government, and cognisance must be taken of what he says about the Easter Sunday attacks. In fact, a thorough probe must be conducted into the alleged foreign involvement in the 2019 terror attacks, which may have been the beginning of a sinister campaign to make the Sri Lankan economy scream. Will any of the presidential candidates have the courage to promise to order a probe into this vital aspect of the Easter Sunday carnage, if elected?
