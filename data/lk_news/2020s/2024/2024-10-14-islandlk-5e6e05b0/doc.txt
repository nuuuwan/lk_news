Marriott Business Council celebrates 10 years of ‘Road to Give’ in Sri Lanka

As part of the Marriott Business Council, Sheraton Colombo, ITC Ratnadipa, Sheraton Kosgoda Turtle Beach Resort, and Courtyard by Marriott Colombo proudly commemorated the 10th anniversary of “Road to Give,” a transformative initiative that united Marriott associates in a shared mission to run, walk, ride and move for charitable causes. This significant milestone not only celebrated a decade of extraordinary achievements but also underscored the profound and lasting impact we have made within our communities.

Since its inception, “Road to Give” has redefined how our associates engage with their surroundings, turning physical activity into a powerful catalyst for positive change. In this remarkable show of solidarity, approximately 9,000 to 10,000 associates from India, Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka participated across a diverse array of activities like runs, group walks, cycling events and wellness challenges—all meticulously designed to raise funds for critical community needs. Our target for this year was to raise donations to provide breast prostheses and hair wigs to Indira Cancer Trust (NGO located in Colombo, Sri Lanka that improves the quality of life of patients affected by cancer through systematic and a comprehensive range of support services for the patients and their caregivers), further amplifying our commitment to support essential areas such as healthcare and social welfare.

“Ten years of ‘Road to Give’ stands as a remarkable achievement, reflecting our associates’ unwavering commitment to service and community engagement,” stated Rahul Maini, Co-Chair – Marriott Business Council.
