Action against Keheliya - SJB MPs contradict each other

Colombo, Feb. 05 (Daily Mirror)- Samagi Jana Balawegya (SJB) Members of Parliament contradicted each other on the party’s position regarding action that has to be taken against Minister keheliya Rambukwella, who is in remand prison at the moment.

Though SJB MP Kavinda Jayawardene announced last week that his party has decided to bring in a second no confidence motion against Minister Rambukwella, SJB National Organizer Tissa Attanayake said what has to be done is to submit a resolution in Parliament requesting President Ranil Wickremeisnghe to take action against Rambukwella and to mete out justice to those who have been affected by the drug purchasing scam.

“What we should focus on is bringing a resolution requesting President Wickremesinghe to take action against Minister Rambukwella and mete out justice to the people who have been affected by the inferior quality drugs which have been purchased without tenders,” MP Attanayake told the media today.

“It was revealed in an investigation conducted by the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) that drugs have been purchased without tenders more than 250 times. I am aware of this as I headed the subcommittee which conducted this probe,” he added.
