First Ceylon Tea showroom opens in Riyadh

A showroom of Al Wazzah Tea, the first ever exclusive pure Ceylon Tea brand in Saudi Arabia was inaugurated by Ambassador of Sri Lanka to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Ameer Ajwad, in the heart of Riyadh on 18 November.

The showroom, which displays a range of Ceylon Tea products and functions as an outlet, addresses a long-standing demand for a dedicated facility for pure Ceylon Tea in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Ambassador Ameer Ajwad referred to this facility as a “significant milestone of the Ceylon Tea industry in KSA”.

Established in 1962, Al Wazzah Tea is a leading brand name of Ceylon Tea in Saudi Arabia, owned by Sulaiman AlAbdulKarim & Brothers. It was initially launched as a humble family business and has now grown into a prominent tea brand in the Kingdom. Al Wazzah Tea, supplied by Finlays, one of the world’s foremost tea companies in Sri Lanka with a legacy spanning over 250 years, contains 100% natural pure Ceylon Tea. The brand has established itself across the Arab world and is enjoyed by millions of people around the globe.

Ambassador was accompanied by First Secretary (Commerce), of the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Riyadh, Tashma Vithanwasam.
