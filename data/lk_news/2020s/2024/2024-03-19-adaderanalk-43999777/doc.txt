Govt. to provide rice to nearly 3 million low-income families

The Cabinet of Ministers has given its approval to provide 10kg of rice per month for each low-income family for a period of two months.

As per the proposal furnished by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, as many as 2.74 million low-income families will benefit from this relief program.

These low-income families will be identified through District Secretaries/Government Agents by involving small- and medium-scale mill owners, the government said in a statement.

In the first half of 2023, the government took measures to provide 10kg of Nadu rice per family for a period of two months covering 2.74 million families in the 25 districts, including Samurdhi beneficiaries.

In order to help maintain the nutritional level of the identified low-income earners, the government decided that it is only appropriate to resume the program this year as well.
