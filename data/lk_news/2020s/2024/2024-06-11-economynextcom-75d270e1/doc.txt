Sri Lanka draft MOUs with bilateral lenders being exchanged, clarified: State Minister

ECONOMYNEXT  – Draft memoranda of understanding with Sri Lanka’s bilateral creditors are being exchanged and clarifications are being made with a view to wrapping up the agreements later this month, State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe has said.

“The drafts are exchanged with mainly the Official Creditor Committee,” Semasinghe told Sri Lanka’s Derana Tv in a talkshow.

“When they are submitted, they exchange it with their membership. If there are comments they will also exchange. In terms of the ideas they express, we may need some clarifications.

“Each member, after looking at it from their country’s perspective, will give their co-operation to help Sri Lanka.

“In many instances we have come to the final stages of these MOUs. I do not think it will take a long time to get an official announcement. Still ideas are being exchanged.”

The International Monetary Fund’s Executive Board is due to take up Sri Lanka’s review on June 12 after “sufficient progress” was made with restructuring.

Sri Lanka is also in discussion with bondholders and hopes to have a face to face meeting soon, Minister Semasinghe said. (Colombo/June12/2024)
