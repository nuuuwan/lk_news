‘A noble opposition can do more work than a govt’ – Dilith Jayaweera

Leader of the ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ alliance, entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera says that if a noble opposition is created, it can do more work than a government.

He further points out that a courageous opposition will not have to remain in the opposition forever.

He made these comments during a special meeting held today (12) in Waskaduwa with the candidates contesting this year’s parliamentary elections from the ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ under the symbol of the ‘medal’.

“We are talking about nationalism, not racism. Many people are afraid to say that Sri Lanka’s nationalism is based on Sinhala Buddhist civilization. They think that people will get angry if they say this.”

He stated that the issue is that politicians choose the racist part of nationalism and engage in politics. “It’s done in the south... even in the north. We are against that.”

Jayaweera stated that this country can be guided towards economic development if everyone in the country is brought to an entrepreneurial mindset.

“There needs to be a strategic plan. That is how countries have developed,” he said.

“Now we have to go to the opposition. We came to change politics. If we form a noble opposition, we can do more work than a government. If we have a good opposition, we don’t have to stay in the opposition all the time. We are a courageous opposition.”

“If there are cases... if there are things hidden under the bed... If there are secret accounts, it will become a cowardly opposition,” he added.
