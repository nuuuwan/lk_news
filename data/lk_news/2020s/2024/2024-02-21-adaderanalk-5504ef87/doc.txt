Research links COVID-19 vaccines with increased heart risks, brain and blood disorders

Amidst the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines emerged as a beacon of hope, offering humanity a vital tool against the deadly virus. However, recent research has introduced a concerning twist to this narrative.

Since the onset of the pandemic, approximately 13.5 billion COVID-19 vaccines have been administered worldwide, marking a significant milestone in the fight against the virus. Notably, around 71% of the global population has received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine.

Despite the widespread vaccination efforts, a recent peer-reviewed study has now sparked health concerns among this substantial portion of the global population. Its findings have linked COVID vaccines from prominent companies such as Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca to rare occurrences of heart, brain and blood disorders.

Researchers from the Global Vaccine Data Network, a research arm of the World Health Organisation (WHO), conducted the largest COVID vaccine study to date. It analysed expected versus observed rates of 13 medical conditions considered “adverse events of special interest” in a study population of 99 million vaccinated individuals across eight countries.

Rare cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) identified in recipients of first, second and third doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s and Moderna’s mRNA vaccines. Highest rate observed after second Moderna dose, with a 6.1-fold increase compared to expected rates.

6.9-fold increased risk of Pericarditis, another heart condition, in individuals who received a third dose of AstraZeneca’s viral vector vaccine. 1.7-fold and 2.6-fold increased risks in recipients of Moderna’s first and fourth doses, respectively.

2.5 times greater risk of rare autoimmune disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome and 3.2 times greater risk of blood clots among recipients of AstraZeneca’s vaccine.

3.8 times greater risk of neurological disorder acute disseminated encephalomyelitis after the Moderna vaccine and 2.2-fold increased risk after AstraZeneca’s vaccine.

In spite of these findings, experts emphasise that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks. For instance, the likelihood of experiencing neurological events or heart inflammation is significantly higher after contracting COVID-19 than after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.

“The odds of all of these adverse events is still much, much higher when infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), so getting vaccinated is still by far the safer choice,” CEO of biotechnology company Centivax Jacob Glanville, who is not involved in the study, told Forbes.

In navigating the complex landscape of risks and benefits, the overarching message remains clear: vaccination remains an indispensable tool in the fight against COVID-19, offering a pathway toward overcoming the disease’s pervasive grip on global health and well-being.
