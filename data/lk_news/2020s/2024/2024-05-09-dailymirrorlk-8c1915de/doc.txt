Plans approved for £61.8m redevelopment of Lord’s

(BBC) - Plans for a £61.8m redevelopment of two stands at Lord's have been approved.

The work, voted through by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) members last week, will increase the ground's capacity by 1,100 seats.

The existing Allen Stand will be demolished and rebuilt with an extra tier added.

Meanwhile, a fourth level will also be built on to the Tavern Stand.

Construction is due to begin at the end of the current season in September and be completed by 2027.

The redevelopment will provide improved catering, hospitality and accessibility, the MCC says.

A £53m project to redevelop the Compton and Edrich stands at Lord's was completed in 2021 to take capacity to 31,000.

Earlier this year, Middlesex County Cricket Club - a tenant at the ground which is owned by the MCC - said they were considering leaving Lord's.
