“It’s no secret, the coaching industry is well and truly on the rise… But did you know, it’s the second fastest industry in the US behind IT? This means more people than ever need coaches! However, the coaching world is an unregulated market.

Luckily, the International Authority for Professional Coaching & Mentoring (IAPC&M) is stepping up as a true leading expert. One of the reasons IAPC&M was founded in the first place is that as more and more people become coaches and mentors, standards are slipping in the industry. They are here to raise the standards in the industry!

They are doing this by ensuring everyone has access to the high-quality training and accreditation required to be a skilled and effective coach and make a positive impact on their client’s lives.

IAPC&M is passionate about raising the standards in the industry, and in doing so, making sure you have the training and support you need to thrive as a coach or mentor,” says IAPC&M Director Dawn Campbell.
