Opposition MPs on how to rescue Sri Lankans from Myanmar cybercrime camps, Ukraine warfront

MP Wasantha Yapa Bandara stated during today’s parliamentary session (June 06) that a potential solution for the rescue of Sri Lankans held captive by Myanmar terrorists has been identified.

Accordingly, he urged the Speaker of Parliament to communicate this development to the government.

MP Bandara disclosed that after gathering information on Sri Lankans stranded in Myanmar and Russia, a viable course of action has been identified, following the discussions held with the authorities of Myanmar and Thailand regarding the matter.

He revealed that talks with a specialized organization named the Department of Special Investigation (DSI), which is under Thailand’s Ministry of Justice, could lead to the rescue of the 49 Sri Lankans detained in Myanmar.

Stressing the importance of conveying this information to the government, he highlighted ongoing efforts to rescue Sri Lankans in Russia as well.

“We believe that over 1,000 (Sri Lankans) are in Russia. We have submitted a detailed report of 220 Sri Lankans to both the consul general and the Ambassador in St. Petersburg. Our request to them is to provide their support in rescuing the Sri Lankans,” he added.

MP Bandara emphasized that with proper execution of the proposed actions, it would be feasible to provide information to families of the injured and hospitalized individuals and those missing during the Ukraine-Russia war.

Three opposition party members, including MP Bandara, J. C. Alawathuwala, and Sujith Sanjaya Perera, travelled to Thailand on June 27.

They engaged in discussions with officials from Myanmar and Russia during their five-day visits to each country, pertaining to the rescue of Sri Lankans held captive by terrorists at cybercrime camps in Myanmar and Sri Lankans fighting in the Russia-Ukraine warfront.
