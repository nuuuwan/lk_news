Unilever wins Gold at ISGSD 2024 Industry Awards for Green Initiatives for Pioneering Clean Energy

Unilever Sri Lanka, a renowned leader in sustainable business practices, secured the coveted Gold Award in the Clean Energy for Productive Uses category at the inaugural International Symposium on Green Industry Initiative for Sustainable Industrial Development (ISGSD 2024). This prestigious recognition celebrates Unilever Sri Lanka’s groundbreaking achievements in implementing innovative clean energy solutions that deliver a significant positive impact on the environment and the communities it touches.

Climate action is a fundamental principle within Unilever Sri Lanka’s global sustainability strategy. The company is deeply committed to fostering business growth while simultaneously driving positive change within the communities it serves. As a testament to this commitment, Unilever Sri Lanka has set an ambitious goal of achieving net zero emissions across its entire value chain by the year 2039.

Unilever Sri Lanka’s dedication to clean energy is demonstrably evident in the company’s remarkable progress towards enhanced energy efficiency. Through a series of strategic initiatives, Unilever Sri Lanka’s Horana factory reduced energy consumption by an impressive 66% in 2023 compared to 2013. Similarly, the Unilever Ceytea factory in Agarapathana achieved a substantial 41% reduction in energy usage during the same period. A key driver of this success story is the recently implemented 2.33 MW Solar Power Project at the Horana factory, a clear demonstration of Unilever Sri Lanka’s commitment to harnessing renewable energy sources.

Unilever Sri Lanka’s unwavering commitment to sustainability extends beyond clean energy generation. The company was also recognized with a Bronze Award under the CSR and Responsible Production category for its impactful initiatives in promoting recyclable packaging, plastic reduction, and plastic collection. This year, Unilever Sri Lanka embarked on a collaborative effort with the Central Environmental Authority and the Marine Environment Protection Authority through a 5-year Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). This partnership tackles a critical environmental challenge: cleaning and preserving the water quality of the Kelani River, highlighting Unilever Sri Lanka’s commitment to environmental stewardship that extends beyond its factory walls.
