Sri Lanka’s Interim Secretariat for Truth and Reconciliation holds consultations in Monaragala

ECONOMYNEXT — A cabinet-approved Interim Secretariat for Truth and Reconciliation Mechanism (ISTRM) has conducted stakeholder consultations in the Monaragala district to “gather insights and address community challenges” stemming from Sri Lanka’s ethnic conflict, the president’s office said.

The President’s Media Division (PMD) said on Monday June 24 that the ISTRM team met Monaragala District Secretary R M P S. B Rathnayake on June 5 to brief him on the proposed Commission for Truth, Unity, and Reconciliation Bill and the work undertaken by the ISTRM.

On June 6, consultations were held with villagers affected by the war in Ethimale, Okkampitiya, and Mahagodayaya at their respective Divisional Secretariat offices to address issues stemming from the 30-year conflict.

On June 7, a press briefing for regional reporters provided updates on the ISTRM’s activities and objectives. According to the PMD, discussions were also held with various stakeholders, including divisional secretaries, government officials, heads of provincial councils, ex-military officers, representatives from civil society organisations in the Monaragala district, military officers from the War College in Buttala, and senior police officers in the Monaragala district, to gather feedback on the proposed legislation.

On June 8, the team met with the villagers of Hambegamuwa, the estate community, and the Islamic community.

The ISTRM held similar consultations in the Anuradhapura district in May.

Sri Lnaka’s cabinet of ministers first approved a Truth and Reconciliation Mechanism on January 16, 2023, pursuant to which the cabinet approved on May 29 a joint proposal by the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms and the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Mechanism and to set up an interim secretariat to “proceed with the relevant foundational work”.

According to the ISTRM’s website, the proposed Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation (CTUR) is expected to focus on investigating incidents of damage, loss, or violation of human rights in Sri Lanka, connected with the conflict that took place in the Northern and Eastern Provinces from 1983 to 2009, or its aftermath.

“The CTUR would provide a platform and opportunity for truth-telling, as well as to investigate, inquire and make recommendations for effective remedies and redress. The CTUR will be an independent entity established by an Act of Parliament.

“The ISTRM recognises that the success of a Truth and Reconciliation Mechanism is possible only when all citizens are engaged as equal partners in this process and contribute to addressing the grievances. As part of the foundational work, the ISTRM will obtain suggestions and recommendations from stakeholders to finalise the legislation for establishing the CTUR. In addition, the ISTRM will undertake selected country studies where Truth Mechanisms have been established, to compile a report of lessons learnt and suggestions on the way forward for the CTUR. Further, the ISTRM will draft Procedures and Guidelines for consideration by the CTUR in implementing its mandate,” the site said. (Colombo/Jun25/2024)
