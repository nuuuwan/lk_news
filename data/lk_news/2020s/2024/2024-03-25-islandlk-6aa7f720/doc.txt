Should I be worried about that insect bite?

I was scratching at my arm the other day because I felt an itch. I noticed a raised red spot, which I knew was a bug bite. But I was certain it was not a mosquito bite. Is it possible to tell what sort of bite it is by just looking at it?

Actually, you can.Most bugs cause a red, raised swelling on your skin when they bite, along with itchiness and possibly pain.But certain bug bites can have specific characteristics.

It is important to know that most bug bites are harmless and the swelling will subside soon on its own.However, some bug bites can be harmful.

I was worried about having bed bugs. How do their bites look like?

There is usually no pain when a bed bug bites you.But because there are usually more than one bed bug and they want to feed on your blood, you may see three or more clustered red marks on your skin all in a line.

Some people are allergic to bed bug bites, so the lumps can be intensely itchy and inflamed for such people.Bed bug bites typically occur on uncovered areas of your skin, such as your arms, neck, face and hands.

Luckily, bed bugs do not carry disease.But because they are in your bed, furniture, or even clothing, you definitely need to get rid of them – a bed bug infestation is no laughing matter.

If you suspect that you have been bitten by bed bugs, you need to check your bed, furniture and clothing very carefully.It can be difficult to spot them because they only like to come out at night, and they are very adept at hiding in crevices, like inside the lining of your pillow, or between the cracks and seams of your mattress.

They are small, reddish-brown, wingless and oval in shape if you manage to spot them.Once they bite you and suck your blood, they become engorged.

Many non-professionals find it difficult to both identify and get rid of bed bugs by themselves.But it is still possible to do it yourself.

You will need to use a vacuum cleaner to suck them up and trap them.Be sure to dispose of the vacuum bag straight away.

You can also use a steamer to go over the suspected hiding places of the bed bugs.Next, take all of your contaminated bed linen or clothing, and wash them in high heat (46°C).

You can also place them in extreme cold, e.g. put the infected items in a sealed bag and put it into your freezer for five days.There are now a lot of bed bug interceptors that you can buy at a hardware store.

But I always recommend calling in a professional because bed bugs are notoriously hard to eliminate, and you may end up missing an infected item and bringing it to another room where the infestation can very easily spread again.

How about tick bites? I am worried because my dog has ticks. Will dog ticks cause disease in humans?

There are many types of ticks out there that like to bite animals.Where dogs are concerned, the most well-known tick is the brown dog tick.In North America, there is also the American dog tick.Like bed bugs, ticks are bloodsuckers.The brown dog tick rarely feeds on humans.

However, the American dog tick can transmit tularemia (also known as rabbit fever) and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.The brown dog tick can also transmit Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

The ticks you have to look out for, however, are deer ticks, which can transmit Lyme disease.I know of some Malaysians studying in American universities who got Lyme disease because they went hiking in the forest.

A tick bite looks like the typical raised, itchy weal on your skin.But if you get Lyme disease, you may notice a skin rash in the pattern of a bull’s eye on a target.

This appears one month after the initial tick bite.You may also have fever, headache, joint aches and irregular heart rhythm.

How about lice? I always worry I might have lice whenever my scalp gets itchy.

If lice bite you, the bites will appear as tiny red spots on your shoulders, neck and scalp.They don’t usually hurt because they are very small, but they can itch.Lice may also live on your clothes and bedding.Some people get rashes from lice bites.

Additionally, if you keep on scratching the bites, they may get infected, which can lead to your skin being red and tender, and your lymph nodes becoming swollen.Luckily, lice don’t carry disease.

That depends on the type of ant.Ant bites can be very painful, immediately causing a red bump on your skin.This can also be very itchy.If you scratch at this, it can break open and become blistered.Most ant bites last a few days.

To treat them, you can apply ice to the bite and take antihistamines.

In Malaysia, it is typical to see large kerengga around, which are also known as Asian weaver ants.They inhabit mango and cocoa trees, and they control the pests of these trees.

They can be very aggressive towards other ants and species, including humans, and their bite is extremely painful. (The Star)Dr YLM graduated as a medical doctor, and has been writing for many years on various subjects such as medicine, health, computers and entertainment.
