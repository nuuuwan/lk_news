Four persons sentenced to death over 2013 murder

Four defendants who were found guilty of murdering a person by attacking him with clubs and stones have been sentenced to death by the Colombo High Court.

Accordingly, the death sentence was given to the four accused, who are residents of the Orugodawatta area, by High Court Judge Aditya Patabandige on Tuesday (30).

A total of 06 defendants had been charged in the Colombo High Court for assaulting a person to death in the Santawatta area of Orugodawatta in 2013.

However, the second defendant in the case had passed away during the trial.

Meanwhile, the sixth defendant in the case was acquitted due to insufficient evidence against him.

In 2017, the Attorney General had filed charges against the defendants under four indictments.

Delivering the verdict, the judge sentenced the accused to death stating that the prosecution had proved the charges against them beyond reasonable doubt.
