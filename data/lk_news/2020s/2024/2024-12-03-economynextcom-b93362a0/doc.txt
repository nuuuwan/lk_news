Sri Lanka to allow rice imports without licenses till December 20: Statement

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will allow rice to be imported without import control license till December 20, a government statement said amid rising prices and a crop damage due to rain.

Sri Lanka had earlier allowed 70,000 metric tonnes of Nadu (par-boiled rice) to be imported to counter rising prices of the grade. The import was allowed only by two state run companies.

“In addition to this, the government decided to temporarily remove existing restrictions on the import of rice,” Jayatissa told reporters Friday.

“The intention of the government is to make all types of rice available to the people.”

There was no decision to reduce a 65 rupee a kilo tax on rice (about 200 US dollars a tonne) he said. (Colombo/Dec03/2024)
