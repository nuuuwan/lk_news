Ruhuna Uni. academic, non-academic and student unions strike continues for second day

The strike action launched by all academic and non-academic trade unions and Students Unions affiliated with the University of Ruhuna yesterday, demanding the immediate removal of the university’s Vice Chancellor, continued second consecutive day today (Nov. 20).

However, a discussion has taken place between the representatives of the relevant trade unions and Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya last evening (19).

Speaking to the media following the discussion, Co-Chairman of the University Trade Union Joint Committee (UTUJC) Dhammika S. Priyantha stated “since assuming the role of Vice-Chancellor, he has imposed significant pressure on the academic staff, non-academic staff, and students, allegedly pursuing personal vendettas.”

“Notably, the studentship of several students has been revoked, and many have been barred from participating in graduation ceremonies. Similarly, non-academic staff have faced undue penalties, while faculty promotions appear to be influenced by favoritism rather than merit. These actions are reportedly enabled by the political protection he enjoys”, he added.

Commenting further, Media Spokesman of the UTUJC Senior Prof. Charudaththa Ilangasinghe said: “As soon as our strike was announced, the government responded promptly, with the Prime Minister initiating discussions on the matter. While we remain hopeful for a positive outcome, the strike will not be called off until the Vice-Chancellor is removed from office.”
