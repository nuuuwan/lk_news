Former Maldives State Minister and 16 others released from case

Colombo, Feb 20 (Daily Mirror) - Former Maldives State Minister of Finance Mohamed Ashmalee and 16 other suspects have been released from the magisterial inquiry relating to the alleged sexual exploitation of a 15-year old girl in 2021.

Colombo Additional Magistrate Keminda Perera ordered the release of 17 suspects including former Maldives State Minister of Finance, former Deputy Chairman of the Mihintale Pradeshiya Sabha and a cardiologist from the magisterial inquiry upon receiving the Attorney General's advice.

The Attorney General has instructed to release these suspects from the case since he does not intend to proceed with legal action against them due to insufficient evidence.

The Police Children and Women's Bureau launched an investigation into the suspects under the Penal Code for procuring an underage girl for prostitution and human trafficking.
