Best option is to seek an interpretation from Supreme Courts: Minister

Colombo, March 01 (Daily Mirror) - The best option to determine whether the course of action followed by Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana in appointing Deshabandu Tennakoon as the IGP is to seek an interpretation from the Supreme Court, Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said today.

Minister Rajapaksa came out with this remark, speaking to journalists after the inauguration of a road development project in Pannipitiya, Colombo. “It is best that Supreme Court gives an interpretation of the action taken by the Speaker,” he said.

Also, he said the Executive does not have any power to influence the Constitutional Council in any way.

He said the issue which the Speaker has faced when appointing the IGP is the non-appointment of the member of the constitutional council (CC) who represents minority parties.

The opposition including Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and National People’s Power (NPP) were up in arms accusing the speaker of violating the Constitution by casting his vote when approving Tennakoon as the new IGP. It was reported that four members of the CC voted in favour of Tennakoon while two voted against. Two civil society members abstained from voting.
