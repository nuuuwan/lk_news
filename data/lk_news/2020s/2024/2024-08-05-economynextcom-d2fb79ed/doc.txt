Less than 1 million new Sri Lanka voters registered at presidential poll

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will see 876,469 newly registered voters for the upcoming September 21 presidential poll, Election Commission data showed, with political parties campaigning for “system change” have been targeting the first time voters.

The island nation’s Election Commission on Monday said 17,140,354 people have registered for voting at the presidential poll this year, 876,469 higher than the voters registered in the 2020 parliamentary election.

Political analysts say most new voters are tech-savvy youth and have been active in new or social media which might influence their voting pattern.

A campaign for a “system change” has already been started by political parties to win first time voters.

Since Sri Lanka got independence in 1948 from the British colonial rulers, it has been ruled by two key political groups with different economic policies with rampant corruption, analysts say.

However, an unprecedented economic crisis with sovereign debt default by Sri Lanka has led for a strong call for change of political system and eradication of corruption with the majority of country’s youth and first time voters backing the idea.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, and Marxists Janatha Vimukthi Peremuna (JVP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayaka are seen as the key candidates in the poll.

There is no credible pre-election poll or survey in Sri Lanka to assess the voters’ pulse before the official results. (Colombo/August 5/2024)
