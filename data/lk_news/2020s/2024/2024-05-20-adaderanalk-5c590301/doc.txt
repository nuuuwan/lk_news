Interim injunction issued against Wijeyadasa and Keerthi Udawatta

The Colombo District Court has issued an interim order preventing Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from functioning as the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and Keerthi Udawatta as Acting General Secretary of the party.

This order was issued today by Colombo District Judge Sandun Withana after considering a plaint submitted by Member of Parliament Duminda Dissanayake.

On May 16, the Colombo District Court had rejected the petition filed by Dissanayake seeking an interim injunction preventing Minister Rajapakshe from functioning as the Chairman and Udawatta as Acting General Secretary of the SLFP.

Accordingly, the Colombo District Court refused to issue an injunction restraining the party, its organizations and officials from acting on the decision taken to appoint Minister Wijayadasa Rajapakshe as the Chairman and Attorney-at-Law Keerthi Udawatte as the Acting General Secretary of the SLFP.

However, Colombo District Judge Sandun Withana had stated that the complainant has the opportunity to amend his plaint and confirm the facts for the relevant injunction.
