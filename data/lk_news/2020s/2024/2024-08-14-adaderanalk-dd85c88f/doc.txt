Namal Rajapaksa signs nominations for Presidential Election

The presidential candidate of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), MP Namal Rajapaksa has signed his nomination papers to contest the upcoming Presidential Election.

He signed the nominations at former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa’s residence on Wijerama Road, Colombo 07.

Meanwhile, the security deposit was placed for SLPP candidate Namal Rajapaksa this morning (14).

SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam had placed the deposit on behalf of Namal Rajapaksa at the Election Commission.

“The security deposit was placed at the auspicious moment, marking another step forward in the journey to victory. We will ensure that Namal Rajapaksa will be sworn in as the ninth President by September 22. After the nominations are handed over tomorrow, the election campaign will begin immediately,” said Sagara Kariyawasam.

The SLPP officially announced its National Organiser, MP Namal Rajapaksa, as the party’s candidate for the upcoming Presidential Election on August 07.

SLPP General Secretary, Sagara Kariyawasam, made this announcement during a ceremony at the party’s headquarters in Nelum Mawatha.

It was initially expected that the SLPP would support President Ranil Wickremesinghe in the upcoming presidential election. However, several members, including the General Secretary of the party, insisted that the party should field its own presidential candidate.

Accordingly, Namal Rajapaksa had been named as the SLPP’s presidential candidate after SLPP MP Dhammika Perera decided to withdraw from the race citing personal reasons.

However, a number of SLPP ministers and MPs have pledged support to the incumbent President in the election and are likely to form a new party for this purpose.
