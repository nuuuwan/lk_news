Exterminators PLC to transform pest management industry in South Asia

Exterminators PLC last week announced that the company recently entered a ground-breaking strategic partnership with PestScan B.V. Netherlands and Sentario UK Limited.

Exterminators PLC is aiming to transform the pest management industry in South Asia from a chemical-focused industry to a technology-focused industry by adapting cutting-edge AI-powered digital pest management solutions. Exterminators PLC is the exclusive distributor of PestScan’s digital pest management software for India, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives and the non-exclusive distributor in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan.

Marlon Ferreira, Founder and Managing Director of Exterminators PLC, stated, “This strategic partnership enables the company to offer advanced AI-powered digital pest management solutions to over 15,000 pest control companies operating in South Asia, setting a new standard for service excellence in the region. Exterminators PLC is poised to become a leader in digital pest technology in South Asia and is also rebranding its brand from pest management to a pest technology brand.”

Exterminators PLC will establish a call centre to provide training and support for both their clients in South Asia and Sentario UK Limited’s clients in the United Kingdom. The company will appoint regional and country resellers in South Asia. Exterminators PLC plans to initially invest LKR 10–15 million in the next 12 months to set up a high-tech business centre to build capacity to cater to 15,000+ pest control companies operating in South Asia to help develop the industry on par with the developed markets.

PestScan offers cutting-edge digital pest management solutions with office software, a technician app, and a customer portal. It is used by 127,000 users in 27 languages worldwide. The software will not only help in reducing chemical consumption and creating a paperless environment, but also in mitigating the workload on employees.

Key benefits of subscribing to the PestScan system include real-time monitoring of pest activity, allowing pest control companies to quickly identify and address pest infestations before they become widespread. The digital platform streamlines the pest control process, saving time and resources, and it also uses advanced technology to accurately detect and track pests, ensuring more precise and effective pest management.
