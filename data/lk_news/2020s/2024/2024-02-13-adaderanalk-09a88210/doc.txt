Suspect arrested for setting pet dog on fire

A man has been arrested on suspicion of setting a female pet dog on fire in Imbulgoda, Gampaha.

The 65-year-old was identified as a resident of the same area, the police said.

The pet dog had been set ablaze by a neighbour on the night of February 10 and died of severe burn injuries while being rushed to a veterinary surgeon by the owners.

Reports revealed that the suspect, the owner of several German Shepherd dogs, had been infuriated after his neighbourâ€™s female pet dog had purportedly mated with his dogs.

Yakkala Police launched an investigation after the owners of the victimized dog filed a complaint about the incident.

The arrestee was supposed to be produced before the court on Monday (Feb.12).
