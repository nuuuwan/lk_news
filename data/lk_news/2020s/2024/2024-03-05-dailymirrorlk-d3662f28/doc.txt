AKD’s change in stance on BR’s return raises questions

Colombo, March 5 (Daily Mirror) - Months ago, NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake extended a friendly acknowledgement to Basil Rajapaksa in Parliament, signalling the relations between them, but his recent criticisms of Basil's re-entry into the country have left many puzzled.

Political circles are abuzz with the news about the arrival of Mr. Basil Rajapaksa to the country today. Mr. Dissanayake was sarcastic about it and said all the members of the Rajapaksa family in politics had no place in Sri Lanka politics.

In his address to a gathering of women supporters of the NPP, he said the Rajapaksas and their supporters would be pondering which election should be conducted first - presidential or parliamentary.

“They cannot do wonders now at all. People in this country won’t accept them any longer,” he said.
