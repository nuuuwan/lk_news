Governor of Uva says his son will surrender

Colombo, March 04 (Daily Mirror) -  Governor of the Uva Province A.J.M. Muzammil today said his son Mohammad Isham Jamaldeen will not evade arrest but will present himself before police tomorrow.

“My son is not absconding. He has informed the police that he will appear before them on or before Tuesday. The police have accepted that the story that he is absconding is far from the truth,” Muzammil told the Daily Mirror.

Police launched an investigation to arrest Mohammad Isham Jamaldeen over an alleged assault on a young woman at an apartment complex in Havelock Town.

Police said Jamaldeen had assaulted the woman during the early hours of Saturday, and she was admitted with injuries to a private hospital.
