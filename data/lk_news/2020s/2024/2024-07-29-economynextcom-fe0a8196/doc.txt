Sri Lanka Podujana Party to field own candidate

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka Podujana Party’s executive committee has decided to field their own Presidential candidate under own flower bud symbol, amid opposition from some, General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam said.

“In the next few days we will decide the name of the person who can win,” Kariyawasam said. “When the party decides to field it’s own candidate there is no chance to support the current President.”

There were some who opposed the proposal, but a ‘vast majority’ had endorsed the decision, he said.

The party has been divided on the the candidate with several ministers openly coming out in support of President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Disciplinary action will be taken against anyone who opposes the decision or decides to contest without the party approval, Kariyawasam said.

Businessman Dammika Perera, who is a nationalist legislator of the SLPP has said he is ready to be the SLPP nominee.

Legislator Namal Rajapaksa, has opposed Wickremesinghe he was an expert at splitting parties.

“From 2022 we helped the current President, we gave him our support till today,” Rajapaksa said after the meeting.

Political analysts say even if the SLPP cannot win, key players within the party would prefer to be the main opposition and Namal Rajapaksa as the leader, who will then contest in the next election.

However an influential section of the party, including several current ministers want to support Wickremesinghe, threatening to split the party.

The party can withhold nominations in the next general elections to anyone who does not support a decision, analysts said. (Colombo/July29/2024)
