Sri Lanka Police make request to voters visiting polling stations

Sri Lanka Police has informed the voters regarding the items that are not permitted at polling stations when they visit to cast their votes.

Joining the “Derana Aruna” program today (19), Police Media Spokesman DIG Nihal Talduwa explained the responsibility of voters when they go to cast their votes.

He stated that they have observed some individuals consume alcohol from the morning and then struggle to enter the polling station where they are unable to make a proper decision.

DIG Nihal Thalduwa further emphasised that the voters should behave in a manner that does not disrupt the voting process.

“If someone arrives intoxicated to that place, the police will have to remove them from the premises”, he added.

Thalduwa also noted instances where people attempt to enter polling stations with objects such as sharp weapons, small knives etc. or mobile phones.

He stated that no one is allowed to enter the polling stations with such objects and that specially mobile phones will not be permitted as they could be used for voice, video recordings, as well as them ringing could be a disturbance to other voters.

DIG Thalduwa further said that if a single polling station is disturbed by a minor incident, it can be a disturbance to voting as a whole.
