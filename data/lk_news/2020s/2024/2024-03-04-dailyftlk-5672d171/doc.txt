Hayleys Aventura has become Sri Lanka’s official service partner (SP) for Grundfos, the globally renowned Danish manufacturer of water pumps.

The SP uniquely positions Hayleys Aventura to provide unparalleled after-sales care and expertise across the entire range of Grundfos products, through the integration of its software systems, access to a comprehensive spare parts inventory and a wealth of technical information.

With tailored capability building programs provided by Grundfos, Hayleys Aventura’s staff are empowered with the requisite knowledge and skills to efficiently address and exceed customer requirements, solidifying their status as trusted experts in Grundfos product support in Sri Lanka.

This partnership which commenced in 2014, will now further enhance Hayleys Aventura’s capability to deliver a stronger customer value proposition from end-to-end, including after-sales services.

“We’re excited to declare our strategic partnership with Grundfos as its official service partner in Sri Lanka, reinforcing our commitment to deliver exceptional solutions. This collaboration enhances our service and support capabilities, reaffirming our dedication to ensure customer satisfaction whilst setting new standards in engineering excellence,” Hayleys Aventura Head of Power Engineering Thilina Bandara said.

Aftermarket Senior Regional Sales Manager CBS APAC Meenna Yodrayub expressed her enthusiasm about the collaboration stating, “Our mission has always been to provide the most optimum water solutions to the world, and this partnership will bolster Hayleys Aventura’s capabilities to add more value to our customers across borders, so we can continue to do what we do best. Ultimately, by enabling Hayleys Aventura to handle the after sales related services, they can now present customers with a total solution to make our pumps more reliable and resilient, on par with the highest global standards.”

Drawing on its engineering expertise, Hayleys Aventura has already executed numerous large-scale projects island-wide via Grundfos products, including installations in one of the country’s largest public sector banks.

An after-sales Grundfos pump replacement project was able to save over 200 (Kwh) electrical units for the client, daily. Meanwhile, an installation of pumps for the improvement of a sand filter, was estimated to have incurred a saving of more than 215,000 (Kwh) per annum.

From conserving energy via smarter and more efficient pumping technologies, to reusing over 1.8 billion m3 of water annually, these efforts underscore Grundfos’ commitment to sustainability in its portfolio, thereby opening avenues for the company’s customers to achieve the LEED U.S. Green Building Certification.
