Thai Pongal marks dawn of a prosperous new year in which expectations are fulfilled - PM

Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena says that ’Thaipongal’, which is a national festival showcasing the excellence of Hindu culture that inherits an agricultural economy, embodies the core values based on peace, unity, and compassion.

This harvest festival, during which the Tamil farmers, having a belief in the traditional lifestyle that is bound up with nature, extend their gratitude to the sun for a rich harvest, will be a reflection of the lifeblood of the nation, he said.

It will be a motivation for the active concept of food security and rural revitalization in the face of the current situation, the PM said in his Thai Pongal message.
