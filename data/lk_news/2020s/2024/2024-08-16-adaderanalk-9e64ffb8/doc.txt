SLPP to take disciplinary action against members supporting President Ranil

It has been reported that strict disciplinary action has been decided against members of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) who are supporting Ranil Wickramasinghe in the 2024 presidential election.

A spokesperson for the SLPP stated that letters informing of this decision will be forwarded to the relevant MPs as soon as possible.

It is also mentioned that after taking disciplinary actions, the party membership of MPs who opposed the party’s decision will be cancelled.

The SLPP politburo recently met to discuss the party’s approach to the presidential election. During the meeting, it was decided to nominate a candidate from the party and to suspend the membership of any member acting against the party’s decisions, regardless of their position.

It is reported that the party’s politburo has been under significant pressure over the past few weeks to take immediate action against members who have opposed the party’s stance. Many SLPP activists have requested the cancellation of the party membership of these MPs.

Accordingly, the SLPP spokesperson confirmed that letters concerning disciplinary action will be promptly sent to the MPs who defied the party’s decisions.
