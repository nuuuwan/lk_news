Mahinda Rajapaksa expresses confidence in President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s leadership

Says SLPP has not decided yet on supporting AKD in upcoming General Election

Affirms SLPP respects the outcome of the 2024 Presidential election

Dismisses possibility of an alliance between SLPP and UNP as party opposed idea strongly

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on Tuesday expressed optimism about the leadership capabilities of newly elected President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, stating that he believes the new leader is capable of running the country effectively.

“I think the chap has the ability to run the country successfully,” he said responding to a question raised by journalists about Dissanayake’s potential to lead the country.

When asked about whether the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) would support President Dissanayake in the forthcoming election, Rajapaksa clarified that no such discussions have taken place within the party as of yet.

Rajapaksa also affirmed that the SLPP respects the mandate given by the people in the recently concluded Presidential election. “The party’s plans for the upcoming General Election are currently being deliberated, as we seek to strengthen our position in the political landscape and increase the voter base,” he added.

The former President dismissed the possibility of an alliance between the SLPP and the United National Party (UNP), stating that the party opposed the idea strongly.

Rajapaksa added that the SLPP, which is an alliance of several political parties, will contest the General Election independently.
