School term tests in WP suspended after more question papers leaked

The term tests of government schools in the Western Province have been suspended after information revealed that two more question papers have been leaked, the Provincial Education Ministry said.

Thus, it has been uncovered that the Mathematics and the English papers have also been leaked, just days after the year-end term test papers of Grades 10 and 11 Science were found to have been leaked to social media a few hours before the commencement of the exam.

The Western Provincial Education Ministry further emphasized that a complaint was lodged with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) regarding the incident.
