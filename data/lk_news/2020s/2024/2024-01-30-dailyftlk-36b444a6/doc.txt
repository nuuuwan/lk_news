Seychelles Coast Guard rescues lost fishing vessel ’’Lorenzo Putha 4’’ and Lankans in Arabian Sea

The Government said yesterday it received notification that the vessel "Lorenzo Putha 4," previously lost in the Arabian Sea, has been successfully rescued by the Seychelles Coast Guard.

The Seychelles Navy officially communicated this information to the Chief of Presidential Staff and Senior Advisor to the President on National Security  Sagala Ratnayaka.

The multi-day fishing vessel "Lorenzo Putha 4" commenced its maiden voyage from the Dikovita fishing harbour on 12 January carrying six fishermen. According to the Department of Fisheries, the vessel was hijacked by Somali pirates in the Arabian Sea, approximately 1,160 nautical miles from land.

Consequently, the Sri Lanka Navy informed the joint maritime force, consisting of 40 countries located in Bahrain, to investigate the missing vessel. The Seychelles Coast Guard initiated a special operation to locate the "Lorenzo Putha 4," successfully finding the vessel in the possession of Somali pirates.

In a commendable effort, the Seychelles Coast Guard arrested three Somali pirates, and all six fishermen aboard the "Lorenzo Putha 4" were safely rescued.
