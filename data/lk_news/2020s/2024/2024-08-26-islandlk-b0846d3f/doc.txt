Elections in Sri Lanka: A Preliminary Audit

Sri Lankans will be voting in September, and they will be voting for the first time since 2020 or 2019 if you consider presidential elections. The economy, more specifically economic recovery, will figure as a top concern. People will be voting for candidates based on their perceptions of how well this government has done and how well they think the Opposition will do if they are given the chance. As of now, economic reforms have polarised opinion. One poll indicates that less than 10 percent – eight, to be exact – believe Sri Lanka is headed the right way. That leaves a staggering 92 percent who disagree or are unsure.

Every oppositional candidate has been keen to distance themselves from the government. The mainstream Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB), which has now formed a coalition called the Samagi Jana Sandanaya (SJS), advocates engagement with the IMF and IMF reforms while easing the burden on the poor and the middle-class. The National People Power (NPP), the parliamentary wing of the leftwing JVP, has been keen on differentiating itself from both the government and the SJS. One of its more vocal MPs stated that a group of ex-ruling party parliamentarians attempted to join it but were rebuffed given their “questionable histories.” The SJS, on the other hand, has not unwillingly taken them in.

There have been mixed reactions to these developments. Given Sri Lanka’s long tryst with electoral democracy, coalitions and alliances have been the bread and butter of presidential campaigns. This much was evident in 2015, when it took a section of the ruling party, the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) as well as the Opposition, in particular the United National Party (UNP), to defeat the then incumbent Mahinda Rajapaksa by, as it turned out, a very slender margin. Similarly, it took mass discontent against the failures of the UNP-SLFP yahapalana government to unseat it, first in 2018 at the local government election and then a year later, in the aftermath of the Easter Bombings, at presidential polls.

One can decry this or accept it. But the complexities of Sri Lankan politics – one could say they are more complex than even Indian politics – are such that political somersaulting has become an order of the day. Discontent with the incumbent – what is popularly referred to as incumbency fatigue – has been an important factor, but in itself has never helped the Opposition galvanise popularity. Anti-establishment politics, of the sort that in the US is associated with third parties and candidates like Jill Stein, Ralph Nader, and Ross Perot, has experienced peaks, but have never been able to override the major parties.

A popular trope in the US, given the political climate there, is that the Democratic and Republican parties represent two wings of the same bird. This may be true, if not completely then to an extent. Certainly, the patronage politics and lobbying pressures that have been ingrained in the system makes it clear that both parties have become susceptible to outside interests, including of course the Israeli and the gun rights lobby. Yet this has never seriously dislodged either party’s standing in favour of a third alternative. The verdict is, of course, still out there: despite the dizzying rise of the Harris-Walz combo, which has already got the Trump team out and running. The ongoing genocide in Gaza and Kamala Harris’s uncalled for response to protesters at a rally may change the equation.

What of Sri Lanka? Here, too, the view that major political parties are extensions of the establishment and are equally culpable stands. It can be argued that, more so that the US, here there has been a greater tendency for parties to fragment and split off into other parties. The SLPP, to give one example, was really a transmogrification of the so-called Joint Opposition, a consortium of rebel UPFA MPs who rallied around, not Gotabaya Rajapaksa, but Dinesh Gunawardena and Mahinda Rajapaksa. Yet by and large, even if you account for outfits like the SJB, parties that have split off have almost always claimed to be true to the spirit of the parent party. In this regard, the SJB’s aim, from a realist standpoint, is to return to a reformed and transformed UNP.

I mention all this because the momenta and trajectories of political parties and candidates, as they stand now, are not what they were two three months ago. Back then a specific party and a specific candidate – the NPP and Anura Kumara Dissanayake – were leading the polls. Everyone, including this writer, sympathised with the party’s radical outlook, more than anything with their vision for a complete change. However, if you take the latest surveys – which, it must be acknowledged, are based on a small sample, hardly representative of the entire country – it is the party that has positioned itself at the centre, the party which has touted itself as most open to rebels and dissidents from other outfits, namely the SJB, that has gained the momentum at the expense of the radical leftwing outfit.

There are, of course, criticisms that the SJB has been able to gain this momentum at the cost of forfeiting its integrity, namely by taking into its fold MPs and ideologues associated with Gotabaya Rajapaksa. In a tweet, one political commentator correctly notes that neither the UNP, with its band of SLPP MPs, nor the SJB has presented itself as an alternative to the establishment. However, as an analyst recently noted in response to the NPP’s critiques of the SJB, where coalitions are concerned, there needs to be some flexibility. Purism of the sort that the country’s New Left has displayed will win it the respect of a significant section of the country. But in itself, it cannot be a substitute for electoral politics.

This may not go down with those who believe that 2022 signalled a turnaround in national politics. The question then is whether there is a contradiction between believing that 2022 represented a crisis of credibility in our politics and calling for broad coalitions and alliances inclusive of rebel, dissident MPs. The Old Left faced that question when it decided to band together with Mrs Bandaranaike in 1964 and 1970. This experiment did not, of course, turn out well. But as far as electoral democracy is concerned, coalitions and alliances will remain what they have always been: a sine qua non of politics in Sri Lanka.
