Forgotten flaws in laws

The government is going hell for leather to resolve some constitutional ambiguities as regards the length of the presidential term, etc. Now that the Supreme Court has determined that the duration of the President’s tenure is five years, the matter could be considered closed.

The government is apparently trying to use the constitutional amendment on the anvil to bolster its claim that it had nothing to do with the abortive fundamental rights petition that sought to delay the next presidential election on the basis of a non-existent constitutional issue. However, there is a pressing need to rectify some real flaws in the Constitution and make new laws to safeguard democracy. The Parliamentary Elections Act should also be amended to prevent it being used to circumvent a vital constitutional provision pertaining to the people’s franchise.

A chronic flaw in the Constitution allows political party leaders and their cronies to undermine the people’s franchise. It enabled Ranil Wickremesinghe, who lost his seat in the 2020 general election, to enter Parliament via the National List (NL) and become the President. Even a person who has never contested a parliamentary election can enter Parliament by having an NL vacancy created; worse, it is possible for him or her to become the President in a situation like the one we experienced in 2022. Hence the need for a constitutional amendment to prevent the misuse of the NL mechanism.

A questionable change effected to the parliamentary election laws about 36 years ago has had a corrosive effect on the Constitution, especially the people’s franchise, which is a fundamental component of representative democracy. That abominable provision has enabled the political parties to bypass the Constitution and appoint individuals of their choice to Parliament as NL members.

As we have pointed out in a previous editorial comment, Article 99A of the Constitution allows only the persons whose names are included in the lists submitted to the Commissioner of Elections or in any nomination paper submitted in respect of any electoral district by political parties or independent groups at elections to be appointed to Parliament via the NL. In 1988, the then UNP government introduced Section 64 (5) of the Parliament Election Act, inter alia, as an urgent Bill, eroding the essence of the constitutional provisions pertaining to the NL and the people’s sovereignty.

The Parliament Election Act of No 1 of 1981, as amended in 1988, allows ‘any member’ of a political party to be appointed to fill an NL vacancy. After parliamentary elections, political parties appoint their NL members as prescribed by the Constitution, and thereafter engineer NL vacancies to bring in persons of their choice as MPs. Attempts to have this highly undemocratic practice terminated by judicial means have been in vain. This ‘smuggling tunnel’ must be closed once and for all.

Worse, it has now been revealed that the words, ‘any member’, were smuggled into the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act after its ratification by Parliament! Strangely, there has been no sustained campaign for the abolition of this legal provision, which allows virtually anyone to enter Parliament without contesting a general election or being nominated as an NL candidate, and even become the Prime Minister, who takes over as the Acting President in case of the popularly elected President’s death, removal or resignation.

The aforesaid legal provision has become a fait accompli because the Constitution does not provide for the post-enactment judicial review of legislation. In a country like Sri Lanka, the need for the judiciary to be empowered to review laws after their ratification cannot be overstressed, given the devious methods that governments employ to subjugate even the Constitution to their political interests. It may be recalled that the UNP-led Yahapalana government stuffed the Provincial Council Elections (Amendment) Bill with questionable sections at the committee stage before rushing it through Parliament, in 2017, to postpone the Provincial Council polls indefinitely.

The vociferous members of both sides of the House, given to talking hind legs off a donkey, have not cared to take up the aforesaid issues which undermine the integrity of the Constitution and the electoral process. No wonder public confidence in Parliament is at a low ebb; anti-politics is on the rise, and protesters wear Guy Fawkes masks.
