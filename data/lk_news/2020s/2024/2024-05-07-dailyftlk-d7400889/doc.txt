VFS Global has experience offering its digital E-Visa platform to 12 Governments including Thailand, Dubai, Equatorial Guinea, Azerbaijan, Suriname, amongst others.

As part of the digital transformation and modernisation of the visa system, the Government of Sri Lanka decided to adopt VFS Global’s digital platform for its E-Visa and Visa-on-Arrival process. The objective is to make the process seamless to aid increased tourism and investment opportunities.

Travellers (visa applicants) can choose from 17 non-resident visa categories ranging from one month to 10 years. The process is online, which brings convenience to applicants. Additionally, travellers can use the dedicated contact centre that provides 24/7 support in five languages namely English, Tamil, Russian, Mandarin/Cantonese and German. This will be expanded to other languages based on the requirement.

The solution is offered through a user-pay model, at no cost to the Government. All investments related to technology, infrastructure and staff are borne by the company.

The total service fee approved by the Cabinet is $ 18.50 across all visa categories. Payment processing charges and applicable local taxes are in addition to the service fee.

The Government benefits from increased efficiencies and transparency in managing the complete process and improved resource utilisation.

VFS Global is committed to promoting Sri Lanka globally through a detailed marketing plan working closely with Sri Lanka Tourism. This is to achieve growth in inbound arrivals from the source markets utilising its global network as per the vision of the Government to achieve 5 million tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka.

The promotion of Sri Lanka tourism will be comprehensively carried out through the new E-Visa platform.
