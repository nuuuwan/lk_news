Parliament, Feb. 22 (Daily Mirror)- The government refuted any plans to provide the Galle Face 'Aragalaya site' where the 'GotaGoGama' agitation was held, to establish a casino.

Chief Government Whip and Urban Development Minister Prasanna Ranatunga said the government had not taken any decision to provide the 'Aragalaya site' to establish a casino as alleged by NPP MP Vijitha Herath.

He said however, the particular investment project had not yet been approved.
