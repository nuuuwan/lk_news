Safety recall affects approximately 32,500 Suzuki Wagon R vehicles in Sri Lanka

Suzuki Motor Corporation Japan has announced a safety recall related to the fuel system of the Japanese Suzuki Wagon R model range.

As the sole distributor of Suzuki vehicles in Sri Lanka, Associated Motorways (Private) Limited (AMW) is taking active steps to ensure the safety and satisfaction of Suzuki Wagon R owners.

The safety recall is a proactive measure to rectify fuel impurity blockages within the fuel system, specifically to address inaccurate fuel readings in the instrument cluster panel. Unattended, this could lead to engine stalling, due to a lack of proper warning indications for insufficient fuel. The affected models include Suzuki Wagon R Premium, Suzuki Wagon R FX/FZ, Suzuki Spacia and Suzuki Stingray.

The safety recall affects approximately 32,500 Suzuki Wagon R vehicles in Sri Lanka, of which around 3,800 vehicles have already been recalled and attended to.

Upon confirmation of their vehicle’s inclusion in the recall, the owners are encouraged to contact the AMW Contact Centre on 0117 609609 to secure a booking for the recall activity. The recall and part replacement will be conducted on a first-come-first-served basis only at AMW locations specified by the contact centre.

AMW reassures the customers that the part replacement will be provided free of charge, ensuring peace of mind for Suzuki Wagon R owners. The safety and satisfaction of AMW’s customers remain its top priority and AMW is committed to resolving this issue swiftly and efficiently.
