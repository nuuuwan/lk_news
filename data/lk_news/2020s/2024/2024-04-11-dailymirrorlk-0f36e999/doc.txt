Japan grants aid to strengthen operations at BIA

Colombo, April 11 (Daily Mirror) - The Japanese government has granted a stock of high-tech scanners, valued at 8.4 million US dollars, to the Katunayake International Airport and the Colombo Port.

In a grant from the Japanese government, a supply of scanners has been provided to monitor health issues, such as epidemics and contagious diseases harmful to public health that could be spread by foreigners in the country.

The first batch of equipment under the grant aid was handed over to Ports, Shipping and Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva by the Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Mizukoshi Hideaki, at the Katunayake International Airport yesterday.

The project is being implemented by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). In addition to disease-detecting scanners, baggage scanners, full-body scanners, foreign passport scanners and a biometric access control system have been provided under the project.

Further, the project includes the installation of a smart toilet system consisting of 150 units at the Katunayake International Airport.

Speaking at the occasion, Ambassador Mishukoshi Hideaki said that Japan will continue to provide unwavering commitment and support for the economic progress and development of Sri Lanka. He emphasised the long-standing friendship between the two countries and said that the grant was an opportunity to strengthen such bilateral ties.
