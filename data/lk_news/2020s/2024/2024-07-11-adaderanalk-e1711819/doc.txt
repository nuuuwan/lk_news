The Railway Station Masters’ Union stresses that if the government tries to control the trade unions through oppression, the trade unions of the entire railway service will never hesitate to join together and fight.

President of the union Sumedha Somaratne said that the railway employees will not carry out any act of sabotage under any circumstances and that he believes their demands will be resolved promptly.

He also mentioned that the executive council of their trade union will meet this afternoon (11) and decide on the future course of action, if their demands are not met.
