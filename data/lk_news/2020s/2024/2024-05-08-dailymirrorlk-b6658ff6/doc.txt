Sri Lanka to overhaul visa issuance process

In the wake of perplexities surrounding the issuance of the on-arrival visa issuance at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), the Government is mulling to overhaul the visa issuance process, Daily Mirror learns.

To fulfill this requirement, a cabinet paper is to be submitted at the next cabinet meeting.

Meanwhile, government sources confirmed that VFS Global has temporarily ceased operations at the BIA counter.

Nevertheless, there has been a request from the government of Sri Lanka to take over the on-arrival visa issuance, which VFS Global has refused.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, Immigration and Emigration Department Controller General I.S.H.J. Ilukpitiya said the entire process pertaining to the issuance of on-arrival visa issuance at the BIA is solely handled by the Immigration officials.

However, VFS Global handles the e-Visa documentation process, with final approval granted by immigration department officials.

When applying for visas via e-Visa, the minimum fee starts from $18.5 and the total fee varies depending on the taxes and the visa type, i.e tourist visa, business visa and transit visa.

In addition, the Cabinet earlier decided to uphold the existing visa fee of USD 50 for a 30-day visa for foreign visitors to Sri Lanka while the double-entry six-month visa is priced at USD 75.
