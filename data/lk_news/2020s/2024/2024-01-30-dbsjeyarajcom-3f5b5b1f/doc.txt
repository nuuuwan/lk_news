(Text of Press Release Issued by the  Canadian Tamil Congress (CTC) on January 29, 2024)

It is with regret we inform our members, supporters and well-wishers that Canadian Tamil Congress (CTC) office was broken into and set on fire on early morning of January 27, 2024 by unidentified individuals.

This reprehensible act appears to be motivated by hate, posing a stark contrast to the very values that brought many of our community members to Canadaâ€”peace, security, and freedom from violence.

At CTC, we have always stood for inclusivity, diversity, and fostering a welcoming environment for all members of our community. It is deeply distressing to witness such a targeted act of hostility against our values and the principles we hold dear.

CTC is working with local law enforcement agencies, who are actively investigating the incident. We are committed to ensuring that the perpetrators are swiftly brought to justice.

CTC remains unwavering in its dedication to fostering a culture of tolerance, respect, and understanding, reflecting the principles that make Canada a haven for those fleeing violence and persecution. We will not let acts of hate deter us from our mission, and we will continue to work towards creating a safe and inclusive environment for all.

We appreciate the support of our community during this challenging time and ask for your understanding as we navigate the aftermath of this incident.

In the meantime, should our members and supporters need to contact us, please do so by email until we resume operations.
