Colombo Hospital staffers refuse uniforms despite allowance

Colombo, March 29 (Daily Mirror) - Minor staffers at the National Hospital Colombo (NHC) have chosen not to wear their uniforms, despite receiving an annual allowance for them, according to an official from the hospital.

These staffers,both male and female, are provided with specific white uniforms for their duties at the hospital to make them easily identifiable. However, instead of wearing these uniforms they allegedly opt for casual attire and behave more like clerical staff or office assistants.

Although they receive an annual uniform allowance of Rs.9,500, they claim this allowance and continue to wear casual clothes. Many of these staffers argue that they cannot perform their duties effectively while wearing uniforms and have reportedly informed the hospital's management about their concerns.

Furthermore, they claim to have received a letter granting permission to wear casual attire while on duty at the hospital.

Following a Ministry-level investigation, disciplinary actions were taken against the staffers after it was discovered that they had been wearing casual clothes based on a letter purportedly issued by a hospital director twenty years ago. Despite the conclusion of the investigations, there has been no apparent change in the dress code of the hospital's minor staffers.
