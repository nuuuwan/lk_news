RIUNIT launches new podcast series

Inaugural episode explores global economic stability with Dr. Howard Nicholas

The Research Intelligence Unit (RIUNIT), a London-based research and consulting firm, has launched a new podcast series on global economic topics, using a nonconventional approach to identify opportunities and challenges.

The inaugural episode, released on 27 May features a panel discussion titled “Why Isn’t the Global Economy in Crisis?” The panel includes renowned Economist Dr. Howard Nicholas, The Economic Training and Information Services Company Co-founder and COO Bram Nicholas, and RIUNIT Founder and CEO Roshan Madawela.

Dr. Nicholas examines global recession trends, Government budgets, national debt, and the IMF’s role. He argues that a significant credit expansion is unsustainable due to the existing credit overhang. Bram Nicholas adds to the discussion with compelling data, emphasising that industrialisation is crucial for economic development and highlighting the importance of manufacturing for Sri Lanka’s economic future. Roshan Madawela offers insights into Sri Lanka’s economic crisis from a real estate perspective, comparing the property market to gold as a safe asset during uncertain times.

The podcast is available for free on the RIUNIT website and YouTube channel. For more information, visit www.riunit.com.
