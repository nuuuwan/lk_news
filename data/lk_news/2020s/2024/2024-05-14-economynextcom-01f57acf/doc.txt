Ex-forces personnel being hired as estate managers a problem: Sri Lanka Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Hiring retired armed forces personnel by some private estate owners has led to violent actions against workers, Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Jeevan Thondaman has said after an incident in Ratnapura involving violent action against workers.

“What they do is for private estates, they will get a retired person from the army or the Police,” Thondaman told reporters on Monday.

“Back in the day it was only planters running the show, so planters knew you have to look after the workers to get good productivity. Unfortunately, that is not the case anymore.”

This follows an incident where violence was perpetrated against estate workers at an privately-owned estate in the Ratnapura District recently.

In footage shared on social media, two people were seen dragging an estate worker to the ground.

“I did speak to the IGP this morning and the IGP gave me an assurance that this is not acceptable. We are immediately going to take action,” Thondaman said.

The minister said that the management of the estate was arrested, and later released on bail. (Colombo/May14/2024)
