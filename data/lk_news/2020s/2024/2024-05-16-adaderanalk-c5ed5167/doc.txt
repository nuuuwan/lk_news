Sri Lankans in Russia-Ukraine warfront: President instructs to send delegation to Moscow

State Minister for Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya announced that President Ranil Wickremesinghe has issued directives for the dispatch of a specialized delegation to Russia to investigate the welfare of Sri Lankans amidst the on-going Russian-Ukraine war.

According to the state minister, this delegation will include the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, a former Ambassador to Russia, and officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with plans for prompt departure to Russia.

State Minister Balasuriya made this announcement during a press briefing titled ‘Collective Path to a Stable Country,’ held at the President Media Centre (PMC) this morning.

“At present, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence are collaborating on a census of Sri Lankans caught amidst the Russian-Ukrainian war. It has been revealed that certain Sri Lankans entered Russia on tourist visas. Among them, were a significant number of retired military personnel who served in the tri-forces in Sri Lanka. The primary challenge lies in determining the exact number of individuals in Russia. As per unofficial sources, approximately 600, 800 Sri Lankan individuals are in Russia.

Notably, the government has been proactive in addressing the situation concerning retired military personnel in Russia. Gratitude is extended to media institutes for their assistance in identifying those involved in the war in Russia. However, a pressing issue remains, which is the lack of specific information regarding the exact locations where these individuals are residing in Russia.

Based on available information, it has come to our attention that smugglers have deceitfully transported individuals to Russia, attracting them with false promises such as the prospect of acquiring Russian citizenship. This is definitely human trafficking. Furthermore, reports indicate the involvement of a senior military officer in this incident. It is imperative to accurately assess the situation and halt the dispatch of personnel to Russia. Thereafter, diplomatic discussions should be held to facilitate the return of those already in Russia back to Sri Lanka. The government is actively engaged in these endeavours.

Despite the Minister of Foreign Affairs being overseas, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has directed the formation of the delegation to investigate the situation of Sri Lankans affected by the Russian-Ukraine war. This delegation, consisting of officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and the former Ambassador to Russia, is expected to be dispatched to Russia, with official notification to be provided to the Russian Embassy regarding this initiative.”

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka’s State Minister of Defence Pramitha Bandara Tennakoon said yesterday that at least 16 Sri Lankan military veteran have been killed fighting in the war between Russia and Ukraine.

Sri Lanka opened an inquiry last week into the recruitment of its citizens for the conflict that has since identified the participation of 288 retired soldiers from the island nation, he said.

“We have confirmed information about 16 who have been killed,” he told reporters in Colombo.

Tennakoon did not say which side of the conflict the soldiers had been fighting on.

But ruling party lawmaker Gamini Waleboda told parliament on Monday that most had been recruited to fight alongside the Russian army.

Those who joined had been duped with promises of high salaries and falsely told they would be given non-combat roles, Waleboda said.

Tennakoon said the recruitment of Sri Lankans was being treated as a human trafficking enterprise and urged military officers not to fall prey to the recruitment drive.

The Sri Lankan government was also in talks with both the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministries to track down Sri Lankans in the two countries and bring them back safely.

“This is a delicate issue,” Tennakoon said. “We are friends with Russia, we are friends with Ukraine. Both are important for us so we are talking to the foreign ministries to get our people back safely.”

Complaints began pouring in from relatives after the defense ministry established its probe last week to collect information on those who had traveled to both countries to join the war effort.

Sri Lanka has repeatedly warned its citizens against traveling to Russia or Ukraine to join the fighting.

Tennakoon emphasized the stringent enforcement of the law against individuals involved in human trafficking. He highlighted that severe penalties would be imposed on those found guilty, regardless of their social status and standing.

Additionally, the State Minister revealed that a group of suspects, including a retired senior military officer, has been arrested under suspicion of participating in human trafficking. Allegedly, they employed retired army personnel as soldiers in the Russian-Ukraine war. Legal proceedings have commenced against them, he assured.

“They have been promoting human trafficking through social media campaigns, attracting victims with promises of high salaries and other privileges. As a result, individuals have fallen prey to this trafficking in successive waves. The government urges the public to remain vigilant against such manipulative tactics. The public is requested to contact 0112 401 146 if they possess any information about human trafficking,” he added.
