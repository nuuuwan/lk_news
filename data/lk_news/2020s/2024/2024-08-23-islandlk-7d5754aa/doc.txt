HUTCH 2X offers savings of up to 60% on home broadband and mobile data bills

For the first time in Sri Lanka, HUTCH 2X unveils an innovative 2-in-1 package that integrates Home Broadband and Mobile Data into a single, convenient plan. This groundbreaking solution sets a new standard by eliminating the need for a separate home broadband connection and an investment for a router to achieve affordable internet.

With HUTCH 2X, subscribers can effortlessly use their smartphones as a broadband solution, providing Wi-Fi through a hotspot at home and mobile data on the go. This approach not only simplifies connectivity but also offers generous data allowances, making it the ideal choice for seamless, reliable internet access both at home or away.

HUTCH 2X combines exceptional value together with high-quality data experience. Plans start at just Rs. 1,099/- for 50GB and range to Rs. 4,999/- for an unlimited internet plan inclusive of all taxes.

Hamdhy Hassen, Chief Marketing Officer at HUTCH, commented, “Only 50% of homes in Sri Lanka still have Wifi due to limited reach of conventional home broadband solutions and start-up costs. There are also individuals who require wifi on the go to connect multiple devices, for work, study or their lifestyle, but have to incur standard mobile data rates to hotspot through their phones. Hutch 2X plans are to overcome these challenges and unlock the next phase of broadband adoption to homes in line with our vision for digital inclusivity, and enable simple connectivity to individuals with more demanding needs with just one very affordable plan for both home and mobile data wifi needs.”
