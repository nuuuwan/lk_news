Iranian President to inaugurate Uma Oya project

Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi is scheduled to visit Sri Lanka in May where he is expected to inaugurate the Uma Oya Multipurpose project, Iranian media reported.

The project includes two dams namely Dyraaba and Puhulpola and also 25 kilometers of water transmission tunnel and two major hydroelectric power plants each with a capacity of 60 megawatts.

Uma Oya multipurpose project is regarded as one of the greatest technical and engineering service projects of Iranian companies in Sri Lanka.

The purpose of the project is to improve irrigation of 5000 acres of agricultural land, transferring 145 million cubic meters of water and generating 290 GW/h of power in a year.

One of the important features of the Uma Oya project is the scattered and diverse components of the project.

It should also be said that this project is one of the largest projects implemented by Iranian contractors abroad.

Back in August 2023, Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry visited Iran and met with his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir Abdollahian in Tehran. During a joint press conference, the top Iranian diplomat called the visit “a turning point in Iran-Sri Lanka ties”.
