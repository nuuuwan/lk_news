Chennai airport customs busts syndicate smuggling 267kg gold from Sri Lanka

In a dramatic turn of events, the Customs department at Chennai International Airport has successfully dismantled a smuggling syndicate involved in trafficking 267 kg of gold valued at INR 1,670 million from Sri Lanka over the past two months.

The operation kicked off following a crucial intelligence tip-off, resulting in the arrest of a shop-owner and his staff, allegedly part of the criminal enterprise.

According to Principal Commissioner R Srinivasa Naik, the investigation began when customs officials flagged a sales executive at the Airhub shop for suspicious behavior. Upon personal search, three bundles of gold concealed in his body were discovered, which he had reportedly received from a transit passenger.

Further inquiries revealed that the smugglers, all hailing from Sri Lanka, had rented the Airhub shop, employing eight individuals to receive contraband from transit passengers and smuggle it out of the airport under this sophisticated operation. ‘‘Using this modus operandi, they managed to smuggle 267 kg of gold over two months,’’ stated the official release.

The implicated Sri Lankan national, the shop-owner, and staff members have been arrested and placed in judicial custody as the investigation continues.
