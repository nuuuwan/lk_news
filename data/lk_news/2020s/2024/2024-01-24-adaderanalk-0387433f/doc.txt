Court order issued barring planned protest march on High-Level road

A court has been issued barring a protest march on the High-Level Road from Delkanda Junction to Nugegoda and Kirulapone to Nunegoda planned to be staged by a group of trade unionists this evening (Jan.24).

Earlier today, the police had sought an order from the Nugegoda Magistrate’s Court, stating that there are 4 G.C.E. Advanced Level examination centres in the area where the demonstration is planned to be staged.

Accordingly, taking into account the police’s request, the court delivered the order on a group of trade unionists including the following: Kumara Gunaratnam and Pubudu Jayagoda of Frontline Socialist Party (FSP); Lahiru Weerasekara, convener of Youth for Change; Mangala Maddumage, convener of Revolutionary Students’ Union; Ven. Tempitiye Sugathananda Thero, general secretary of the Joint Health Workers Union (JHWU); Dhammika Munasinghe, secretary of Joint Development Officers’ Centre; Ven. Thenne Gnananada Thero, convener of Unemployed Graduates’ Association; Hemamali Abeyratne, national organizer of Free Women Movement; and Wasantha Mudalige, former convener of Inter-University Students’ Federation (IUSF).

The trade unionists are thus barred from stating a protest march on the High-Level Road from Delkanda Junction to Nugegoda and Kirulapone to Nunegoda.
