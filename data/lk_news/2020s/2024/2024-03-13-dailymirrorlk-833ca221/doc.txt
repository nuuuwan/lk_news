Sri Lanka eye on winning start in ODI Series

Colombo, March 13 (Daily Mirror) - Buoyed by their thrilling 2-1 Twenty20 International (T20I) Series victory against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka gear up for a three-match One Day International (ODI) Series starting today at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chattogram.

The ODI Series presents an opportunity for the Sri Lankans not only to extend their winning streak against Bangladesh but also to avenge their previous defeat in the last ODI encounter at the ICC World Cup 2023.

Sri Lanka displayed grit and determination in the recently concluded T20I series, overcoming a blip in the second match to clinch the series with victories in the first and third games.

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Chief Selector Upul Tharanga said Lahiru Kumara has been added to the ODI Squad after Asitha Fernando was ruled out following an injury while Kamindu Mendis was included replacing Shevon Daniel.

Sri Lanka completed a sweep of the three-match ODI home series against Afghanistan in February and Pathum Nissanka finished the series with 346 runs, the most by a Sri Lankan in a three-match ODI series.

Nissanka missed the T20I series in Bangladesh due to a hamstring injury that he sustained during the home series.

However, Nissanka who missed the T20I series has been named in the ODI squad.

While Sri Lanka will carry the momentum of the T20I series win, Bangladesh will seek to draw strength from playing at home.

Bangladesh's seven-year unbeaten streak in home ODI series ended last year with a 2-1 series defeat to England in March. Later that year, the Tigers also lost the ODI series to Afghanistan and New Zealand at home.

Shanto, who will be leading the team in ODIs for the first time as the permanent skipper on Wednesday, said that his team is determined to bounce back from the poor results in home ODIs in 2023.
