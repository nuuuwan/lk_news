Damn Fine Coffee expands into global market

Fits Retail is expanding globally with its Damn Fine Coffee brand, launched in 2021. Originating as a premium coffee vending company in 2019, Fits Retail partnered with major coffee equipment brands and entered the HORECA segment. Damn Fine Coffee focuses on quality and sustainability, working with over 300 smallholder farmers and establishing a coffee processing centre in 2022, which earned recognition as one of Sri Lanka’s best processors. The company also sponsors the National Barista Championship and offers barista training. In 2023, Damn Fine Coffee made its first international export, marking its entry into the global market and signalling plans for further expansion.

Fits Retail started in 2019 as a premium coffee vending company, a fully owned subsidiary of Aberdeen Holdings (Pvt) Ltd. By 2020, it expanded into the consumer market with DeLonghi, the top espresso maker in 47 countries, and entered the HORECA (Hotel, Restaurant, and Café) segment with Rancilio and Bravilor Bonamat. Fits Retail became the sole authorized agent for specialty coffee machines like Victoria Arduino and Mahlkonig and went on to also sponsor the National Barista Championship in 2023 and 2024.
