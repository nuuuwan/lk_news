Fairly heavy showers, strong winds expected in parts of the island

The Meteorology Department says showers will occur at times in Western, Sabaragamuwa and North-western provinces and in Galle, Matara, Kandy and Nuwara-Eliya districts.

Fairly heavy showers about 50 mm are likely at some places in Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces and in Galle, Matara, Nuwara-Eliya and Puttalam districts.

Showers or thundershowers may occur at a few places in Uva province and in Ampara and Batticaloa districts during the evening or night, it said.

Strong winds of about 40-50 kmph can be expected at times over Western slopes of the central hills, Northern, North-central and North-western provinces and in Hambantota and Trincomalee districts.

Cloudy skies can be expected in Northern, North-central, Eastern and Central provinces.

The general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.

Meanwhile, the sun is going to be directly over the latitudes of Sri Lanka during 28th of August to 06th of September due to its apparent southward relative motion.

The nearest places of Sri Lanka over which the sun is overhead today (29) are Oddusuddan, Mankulam, Terankandal and Mallavi about 12.11 noon, says the Met. Department.
