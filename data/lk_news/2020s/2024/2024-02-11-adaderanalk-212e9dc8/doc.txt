Bribery Comm. takes legal action against DMT staffers for unlawful vehicle registrations

The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) has filed legal action against seven persons, including five staff members of the Department of Motor Traffic (DMT) for the unlawful registration of hundreds of vehicles.

Accordingly, the CIABOC said it has filed said action against the seven persons over the registration of approximately 400 vehicles that had not been cleared by the Sri Lanka Customs, thereby incurring a significant loss  of revenue to the state.

Issuing a statement in this regard, the CIABOC revealed that further information was gathered pertaining to 156 of the 400 vehicles, adding that several of them had been categorized as ‘luxury vehicles’.

According to a court order obtained by the CIABOC, seven of the 156 vehicles are to be handed over to the Sri Lanka Customs from their current owners. As such, five of the seven vehicles have already been handed over to Sri Lanka Customs.
