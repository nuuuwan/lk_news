Health Ministry admits glass particles being found in ‘Meropenem’ drug

Colombo, Feb 13 (Daily Mirror) - The Health Ministry has initiated an investigation following allegations made by health trade unions regarding the haphazard storage of drug consignments at Customs terminals in Welisara, Wattala, and Kelaniya.

Speaking to the media, Deputy Director General (Medical Services) Dr. G. Wijesuriya admitted that glass particles had also been found inside the vials of the antibiotic named ‘Meropenem’ stored within these terminals.

According to the reports, these consignments have been placed for over four months violating the proper standards of storage.

The health ministry is looking into the further details of the importer of the Meropenem drug.

Meanwhile, Dr Wijesuriya highlighted the dearth of human capital in the Medical Supplies Division (MSD) which was under the fire following the allegations regarding the import of the substandard immunoglobulin drug.

According to the health ministry, four MSD officials including the Director are currently in remand custody while several others have resigned.

The concern is being addressed as it could have led to the delay in releasing the said consignment of drugs.
