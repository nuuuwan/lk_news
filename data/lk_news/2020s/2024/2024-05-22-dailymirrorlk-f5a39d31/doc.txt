Gnanasara Thera not among inmates to be released on Vesak Day

Colombo, May 22 (Daily Mirror) - Ven. Gnanasara Thera is not among the 278 prison inmates to be released under the Presidential pardons in view of Vesak Poya which falls tomorrow (22), the Prisons Department said.

The Chief Prelates of the Malwathu, Asgiri, Ramanna Nikaya and the Amarapura Maha Sangha Sabha had appealed to the President to grant Ven. Gnanasara Thera a pardon on Vesak Poya day.

Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thero was sentenced to four years of rigorous imprisonment for the defamatory comments made against Islam in late 2016.

According to the Department of Prisons, inmates from some prisons across the country, including 15 from the Welikada Prison and 37 from the Mahara Prison, will be given Presidential pardons.

Ten female prisoners are among those who will receive the Presidential pardons. The pardon is under Clause 34 of the Constitution.
