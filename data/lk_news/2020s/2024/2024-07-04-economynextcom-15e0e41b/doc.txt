Talks on resuming Japan funded Sri Lanka airport terminal next week: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will meet representatives of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to start talks on resuming work on an airport terminal that was halted after reaching a deal with official creditors, Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.

Japan halted loans to Sri Lanka after sovereign default was declared on April 2022.

“Next week the JICA is coming to see me,” Minister de Silva told reporters in Colombo. “That is the benefit of restructuring.

“They have agreed to give additional finances necessary for the escalation of prices also.”

To complete the terminal a new Japanese contractor has to be selected, he said. (Colombo/July04/2024)
