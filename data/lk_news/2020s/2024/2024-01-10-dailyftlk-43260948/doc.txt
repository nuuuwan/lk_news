SJB MP Chaminda Wijesiri resigns from Parliament

Main opposition, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Parliamentarian Chaminda Wijesiri yesterday announced his decision to resign as a Member of Parliament.

Addressing the Parliament, the Badulla District MP said he has submitted his letter of resignation to the Speaker of the House MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena.

MP Chaminda Wijesiri further said that the Parliament needs a new mandate, noting that the public was cursing all 225 MPs, including their children and that his children do not deserve such ill will.  Wijesiri pointed out that the children of the Parliamentarians do not deserve to be blamed for the downfall of the country, which may or may not be due to the actions of the MPs.

He also commended the Opposition leader who’s also the SJB Leader Parliamentarian Sajith Premadasa for his leadership of the party. Wijesiri said he will not leave the party but will consider re-entering politics under the SJB once MP Premadasa is elected to power.
