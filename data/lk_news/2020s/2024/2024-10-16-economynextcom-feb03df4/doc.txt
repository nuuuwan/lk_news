“Both the President and Prime Minister instructed officials to expedite the implementation of these projects,” the PMD said in a statement.

“Attention was also drawn to reorganizing the current school system to ensure that educational reforms are more accessible and effective for all children.”

The government’s instruction came at a progress review meeting of the Ministries of Education, Science, and Technology.  President Anura Kumara Dissanayake during the meeting emphasized the need to rebuild Sri Lanka’s education system in alignment with global demands to achieve the country’s educational goals.
