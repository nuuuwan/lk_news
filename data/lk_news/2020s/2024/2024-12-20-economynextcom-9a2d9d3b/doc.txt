Sri Lanka President pledges to reform public sector

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s President Anura Dissanayake has promised to reform the country’s public service into a modern, efficient system.

“Transforming Sri Lanka’s public service into a modern, efficient system is a challenge we are committed to overcoming,” Dissanayake said on social media platform X.

“We’re building a better future, from structural reforms to digital initiatives and overseas training to rebuild trust in state institutions.”

Dissanayake pledged to reform Sri Lanka’s public service with structural changes, digital projects, and training programs,” his media division said.

“He emphasized accountability and fairness to rebuild trust in state institutions.”

Dissanayake, and his People’s National Party, received a large number of public sector votes in the presidential and general elections as evidenced by the postal vote.

The island nation has a bloated public sector with more than 1.5 million public sector employees at present, the size having doubled over the past 15 years, according to official data.
