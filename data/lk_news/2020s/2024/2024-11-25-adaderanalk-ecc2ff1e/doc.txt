2024 A/L examination begins today

The 2024 G.C.E. Advanced Level (A/L) examination is scheduled to commence from today (25).

The examination will be conducted over a period of 22 days, concluding on December 20. A total of 333,185 candidates are expected to sit for the examination this year.

The examination is set to commence at 8:30 a.m.  and the Commissioner General of Examinations, Amith Jayasundara, has requested all candidates to report to their respective examination centers with a valid form of identification well in advance.

“Candidates must bring a valid identity card to the examination center. For this purpose, a national identity card issued by the Department of Registration of Persons, a valid foreign passport, or a valid driver’s license will be accepted as proof of identity,” he stated.

He further clarified, “Apart from these three types of identity documents, no other forms of identification will be accepted. However, the Department of Registration of Persons provides temporary identity cards, which are also considered valid for this purpose.”

The Commissioner General emphasized the importance of ensuring the signature of the candidate is verified on their admission card before arriving at the examination center.

“There is a section on the back of the Admission Card to verify the candidate’s signature. This section must be completed by the candidate before the examination. Candidates must bring the duly completed Admission Card to the examination center, as failure to do so may lead to complications during the examination process,” he added.
