SLIC embarks on a new era: Legal segregation marks a historic milestone

Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, the pioneering insurance giant with a rich history spanning over 60 years, has officially entered a new chapter with the legal segregation of its Life and General insurance businesses. This monumental decision, in compliance with the regulatory framework set by the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (IRCSL), takes effect from Feb 1.

A momentous event to mark this historic occasion was held at the Sri Lanka Insurance head office on Feb 1, following traditional Sri Lankan customs. At the ceremony, the Chairman of Sri Lanka Insurance President Counsel Ronald C Perera presented the business registrations to the Group CEO Chandana L Aluthgama, symbolizing the establishment of two distinct entities: Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Life Limited and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation General Limited.

Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Life Limited (SLICLL)and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation General Limited (SLICGL) foresee new opportunities for growth and success. The legal segregation allows for a more focused execution of their respective business strategies, ensuring enhanced efficiency and effectiveness in serving their customers. Both companies remain steadfast in their commitment to superior customer service. The essence of their business drive for 2024, ‘Customer centricity through focused specialization,’ remains unchanged.

Chandana L. Aluthgama, Group Chief Executive Officer of Sri Lanka Insurance stated, “even though the legal segregation commenced on Feb 1 the Life and General business of SLIC has functioned as distinctive entities with its separate profit and loss statements, financial operations, and strategic focuses. Today’s announcement formalises this legal segregation, marking a significant milestone in our pursuit of excellence. It is also imperative to note that financial management of the two businesses has been prudently managed independently, ensuring the security of our funds and investments. This is a testament to our commitment to best practices and sound financial governance.”

Reflecting on this significant milestone, the Chairman of Sri Lanka Insurance President Counsel Ronald C Perera said: The segregation is not just a corporate restructuring; it marks the beginning of a new journey for Sri Lanka Insurance. While we bid farewell to our composite status, we welcome the opportunity for greater specialization and excellence in both Life and General insurance. Our commitment to our customers, employees, and the nation remains unwavering.”
