‘Accept resignations of any individual without hesitation’ – Minister tells CEB

The management of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has been instructed by Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera to accept the resignations of any employee of the state-owned electricity company, and to recover all dues owed to CEB.

Taking to ‘X’ (formerly Twitter), in response to media reports claiming that around 5,000 CEB employees stand ready resign at the same time, the Minister said, “I have instructed CEB management to accept resignations of any individual without hesitation and to recover all dues to CEB”.

He further stated that he also instructed the relevant officials to expedite the work related to the CEB’s reforms and other matters, including cost reduction mechanisms, implementing identified power projects in the generation plan, expanding digital payment platforms and outsourcing payment collections.

He also emphasised that matters related to taking the relevant disciplinary and legal measures against those employees who disrupted the services of CEB be taken swiftly.
