King Charles diagnosed with undisclosed form of cancer

Colombo (News 1st) â€“ King Charles III has been diagnosed with cancer and began treatment on Monday, Buckingham Palace said in a statement. It did not state what type of cancer the King has been diagnosed with.

The cancer was identified during the King's recent hospital 3-day treatment for a benign enlarged prostate. "A separate issue of concern was noted, and subsequent diagnostic tests have identified a form of cancer", the Palace said.

Charles, 75, who assumed the throne last May, will postpone public duties, but will continue to undertake state duties.

His treatment is being carried out on an out-patient basis, and he does not need to stay overnight in hospital.
