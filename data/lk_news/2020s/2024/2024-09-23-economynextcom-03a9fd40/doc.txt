Sri Lanka stocks pick up after opening lower

ECONOMYNEXT – The Colombo Stock Exchange began to pick up after opening lower following Sri Lanka’s presidential election over the weekend.

The ASPI was up 81.21 points, or 0.74 percent, in mid-day trading at 11,047, while the S&P SL20 was up 1.43 percent, or 44.27 points at 3,146. Turnover was 682 million.

Stockbrokers said it was too early to comment, and that “There’s nothing concrete yet, we can’t put a weight on any one fact.”

“The perception is that there might be a more practical view from the new government, they are open to suggestions, and promise to cut expenditure.”

“People are waiting to see what will be implemented, if they address the needs of the capital market.”

The positive momentum from last week ISB deal was continuing, they said, with banking stocks trading up.
