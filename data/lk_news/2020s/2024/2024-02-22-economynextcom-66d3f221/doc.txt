Sri Lanka’s Seylan Bank to raise 10bn through debenture issue

ECONOMYNEXT – Seylan Bank Plc said it was planning to raise up to 10 billion through a Basel III compliant debenture sale.

Subject to the approval of the shareholders, the bank will issue 100,000,000 Tier II listed, rated, unsecured, subordinated, redeemable debentures with a non-viability conversion at 100 rupees each, to raise 10 billion rupees.

“One hundred million (100,000,000) debentures will be issued in one or more issuances until 31st December 2024,” the bank said in stock exchange filing.

“The size, tenure/maturity period (minimum five years), coupon rate/s, frequency of coupon/s etc as determined by the Board will be notified prior to the opening of each issue.”

In July last year, Fitch Ratings said it was maintaining an ‘A(lk)’ national rating on Seylan Bank which was on rating watch negative. “We believe risks to Sri Lankan banks’ operating environment (OE) remains high despite the exclusion of the banks’ holdings in Sri Lankan rupee-denominated government securities from the sovereign domestic debt restructuring,” the rating agency said.

Seylan Bank Plc shares were trading down at 43.00 on Thursday. (Colombo/Feb22/2024).
