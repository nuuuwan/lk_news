The Urban Development Authority (UDA) and Dilmah Ceylon Tea Company have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding to improve the sustainability of Beddagana Wetland Park.

Beddagana Wetland Park has become an ecological haven for local and foreign tourists. It is a magnificent wetland park that was started in 2014 by UDA under the assistance of the World Bank and handed over to the public in 2016.

This wetland park, which is a part of the Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte Bird Sanctuary, is home to many different native bird species, fishes, butterflies, and dragonflies. Because of its proximity to the Rampart of the ancient, archaeologically significant Kotte Kingdom and its stunning Diyawanna Oya, the value of this park cannot be emphasised. The city of Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte, which was named a RAMSA Wetland Capital City in 2018, is home to Beddagana Wetland Park.

UDA is responsible for the maintenance and administration of this park. It said numerous unique programs for children, youth, and adults are offered there, as well as workshops for schoolchildren, and field trips for university students. The strongest indication of this park’s recognition on a global scale is the fact that it is currently a member of the (WLI) Wetland Link International – Asia Institute. Additionally, beginning in 2023, several programs were carried out in this wetland park in association with the (RR-CEA) Ramsa East Asia Wetland Institute.

Through the MoU, the Dilmah has committed to financially sponsor the ongoing park renovations as well as the chosen educational programs that will be implemented in the Beddagana Wetland Park for one year. Additionally, they have stated that they are willing to share their knowledge to maintain the ecology of the wetland park through the Dilmah Conservation Division.
