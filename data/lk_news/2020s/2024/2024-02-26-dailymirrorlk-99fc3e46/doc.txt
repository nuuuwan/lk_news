Composition of expert committee to be expanded

Colombo, Feb 26 (Daily Mirror) -Â  In light of the gravity and complexity of the sequence of events surrounding the recent deaths at the dialysis unit of the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital, the Health Ministry is considering expanding the composition of the five-member committee tasked with investigating into the matter, the Daily Mirror learns.

According to a top source, the initial investigations conducted at hospital level have failed to determine the actual cause of deaths prompting the hospital management to request the Health Ministry to conduct a through investigation.

Hence, the Health Ministry appointed a five-member committee headed by Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Samitha Ginige.

Furthermore, sources are of the opinion that the incident may have occurred due to the entry of certain unidentified pathogens into the dialysis unit.

Nevertheless, the initial probe carried out at hospital level has not shed light on any entry of such pathogens into the dialysis unit.
