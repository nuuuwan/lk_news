It is more than a platform; it is a bridge to opportunities and a commitment to prosperity for both Sri Lanka and the Maldives.”

Sri Lanka Business Council President Duminda Rathnadiwakara emphasised the Council’s focus on fostering connections not only at the government level but also within the business communities of both countries. He outlined its mission to create practical pathways for collaboration, ensuring that opportunities are accessible to all enterprises.

The Council comprises 14 Executive Committee members and has introduced a special membership category for Maldivian business leaders, with 25 honorary members inducted at the event.
