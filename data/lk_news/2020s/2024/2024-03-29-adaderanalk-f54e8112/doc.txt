Rs. 100mn worth of assets owned by underworld figures seized

Assets worth more than Rs. 100 million – including two multi-day fishing craft, three-wheelers, motorcycles and plots of land – owned by underworld figures have been confiscated.

These assets were impounded by the Illegal Assets and Properties Investigation Division of Sri Lanka Police in Galle, Ambalangoda, and Ahungalla, under the ongoing ‘Yukthiya’ operation.

Police launched the special island-wide operation in December 2023 to crack down on drug peddling and organized crimes in the country.
