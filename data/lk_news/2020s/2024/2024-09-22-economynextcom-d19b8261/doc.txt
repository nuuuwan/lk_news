Sri Lanka EC starts unprecedented preferential vote counting in presidential poll

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Election Commission (EC) said it had already started second and third preferential vote counting for top two candidates Anura Kumara Dissanayaka and Sajith Premadasa after they failed to secure more than 50 percent votes in a Saturday presidential poll.

Election Commissioner R M A L Rathnayake told reporters that none of the candidates has obtained more than 50 percent of the votes to declare victory after the first counting.

He said Dissanayaka has topped and Premadasa has got second highest votes.

“We will eliminate all other candidates from the contest and we will be counting the second and third preferential votes for these two candidates from the other candidates,” Rathnayake said.

This is the first time Sri Lanka has gone for preferential vote counting at presidential poll in its nine presidential poll history since 1982.
