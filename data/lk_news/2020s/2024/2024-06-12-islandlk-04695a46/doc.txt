“District Industry Promotion Councils”  to be established

The Cabinet of Ministers approved the proposal presented by the Minister of Industries to establish 25 “District Industry Promotion Councils” covering the entire island and to appoint a steering committee consisting of representatives from the public sector, private sector and other relevant institutions to determine the structure, role and responsibilities of those councils and to supervise the entire  process.

As locally established micro, small and medium scale industries are currently facing many problems, the need for a system that is easily accessible and beneficial to all has been recognized in order to create a favorable environment to face those challenges. For that, it is essential to establish, network and promote strong relationships between all relevant institutions so that quality and efficient institutional support and services can be provided at the local level to micro, small and medium scale industries through a multi-sectoral and integrated approach.
