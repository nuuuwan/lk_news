Sri Lanka marks 20th anniversary of tsunami

Sri Lanka yesterday commemorated the 20th anniversary of the devastating 2004 tsunami, a tragedy that claimed over 35,000 lives and caused widespread destruction. It was one of the deadliest natural disasters faced in history, bordering the Indian Ocean, leaving an unforgettable mark on global disaster response and resilience efforts.

The 2004 Boxing Day tsunami killed 226,408 people, of which 35,399 were in Sri Lanka.

A two-minute silence was observed countrywide from 9:25 to 9:27 a.m. yesterday, paying tribute to the victims of the tsunami. Thousands gathered to honour the memory of those lost at district level.

The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) spearheaded the observance of ‘National Safety Day’ with events organised at district level. The main event took place at the Peraliya Tsunami Memorial Statue in Galle, an emotional reminder of the tragedy’s impact.

Peraliya remains etched in history as of the most affected sites, where the tsunami derailed a crowded train, resulting in the deaths of over 1,500 passengers – the single deadliest rail disaster ever recorded.

Speaking at the commemoration, DMC officials stressed the importance of disaster preparedness and the lessons learned from the catastrophe. “The tsunami changed the way we approach disaster management and resilience. Today we honour those we lost by striving for safer communities,” a DMC official said.

The tsunami’s aftermath, however, united Sri Lankans in an unprecedented display of solidarity and resilience. In the years, since, the country has worked to improve disaster response mechanisms, enhance early warning systems and raise public awareness about natural disasters — but there is still a lot of room for improvement.
