Sri Lanka’s deaf drivers can get light vehicle driving licenses

ECONOMYNEXT – A pilot project that would allow hearing-impaired persons to obtain light-vehicle driving licenses will be implemented in the Gampaha District initially before being rolled out island-wide.

“Cabinet approved the implementation of a pilot project in the Gampaha District to provide light vehicle driving licenses for hearing impaired persons,” Cabinet spokesman Minister Bandula Gunawardena said on Tuesday.

“Thereafter, necessary steps will be taken based on the results of the pilot project and the recommendations of the committee headed by the Ministry of Transport and Highways Secretary regarding the implementation of this project island-wide.”

The issuance of driver’s licenses to hearing impaired persons will be done on a bi-annual renewal basis.
