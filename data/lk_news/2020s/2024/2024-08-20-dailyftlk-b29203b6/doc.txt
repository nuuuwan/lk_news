NPP cries foul over new Presidential Advisers

National People’s Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday voiced his concern over the appointments of Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakkara as new Advisers to the President by incumbent Ranil Wickremesinghe who is also seeking a mandate from the people.

He told a news conference that the Elections Commission has issued a circular preventing new appointments during the election period hence the President’s move was in violation.

Dissanayake also said the appointment will allow them to intervene in the activities of these Ministries, entertain perks and privileges such as vehicles and funds. He said the entire United National Party (UNP) camp in the President’s office is entertained by State funds where UNPers such as Akila Viraj, Sagala Ratnayake, Ashu Marasinghe etc. have been given advisory posts and Navin Dissanayake was appointed as a Governor.

Dissanayake said the President was misusing State resources and funds for his election campaign while violating election laws and that the Election Commission has been unable to stop that.
