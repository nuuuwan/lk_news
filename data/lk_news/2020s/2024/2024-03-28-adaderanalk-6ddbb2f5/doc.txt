President promises to improve football infrastructure in Sri Lanka

President Ranil Wickremesinghe has met with the Sri Lankan national football team at the Presidential Secretariat and commended the efforts in their recent triumph over Bhutan, marking the first win in a decade.

As a symbolic gesture of honour, FFSL President Jaswar Umar presented President Ranil Wickremesinghe with a customized National Football Jersey.
