Bill classifying public images handed over to President’s Secretary

The Bill aimed at classifying public images to safeguard freedom of speech, expression, and creative rights was recently handed over to President’s Secretary Saman Ekanayake at the Presidential Secretariat by the committee, appointed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the President’s Media Division (PMD) said.

The former Chairman of the Board of Directors of Public Performance Board Saman Athaudahetti chaired the committee tasked with drafting the new legislation. Committee members involved in this endeavour included cinematographer Ashoka Handagama, dramatist Rajitha Dissanayake, designer Anoma Rajakaruna and President’s Counsel Jagath Wickramanayake.

The draft aligns with contemporary international trends and standards, developed through consultations with stakeholders in film, theatre and performing arts. Anticipated to be enacted, the new Act will adhere to the currently enforced Public Exhibition Control Ordinance passed in 1912, it added.

Committee Chairman Saman Athaudahetti affirmed that the Act offers solutions to various issues related to art creation. He emphasized that the implementation of this legislation will ensure the comprehensive protection of creative freedom, according to the PMD.
