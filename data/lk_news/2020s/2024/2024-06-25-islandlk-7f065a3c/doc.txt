Govt. focuses on South-South cooperation in energy sector

In a strategic move aimed at advancing national development efforts, the Sri Lankan government is intensifying its focus on South-South Cooperation in the energy sector. Dr. Sulakshana Jayawardena, Secretary of the Ministry of Power & Energy, reaffirmed Sri Lanka’s commitment to expanding partnerships with Southern hemisphere nations during a recent gathering in Colombo.

Jayawardena stressed the invaluable contributions from Chinese partners in renewable energy technologies at the Strategic Steering Committee meeting and summary workshop of the Biogas, Biomass, and Solar South-South and Trilateral Cooperation Project. This initiative, involving collaboration between Sri Lanka, China, and Ethiopia, aims to foster mutual understanding and facilitate knowledge exchange.

“We foresee an expanding arena for South-South cooperation, noted Jayawardena, highlighting Sri Lanka’s ambitious energy transition program geared towards achieving carbon neutrality. Leveraging international partnerships is pivotal to accelerating progress towards sustainable energy solutions.

Under the auspices of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the project has significantly enhanced local access to clean and renewable energy in Ethiopia and Sri Lanka. Implemented in partnership with China’s Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Science and Technology, as well as Ethiopia’s Ministry of Water and Energy, the initiative underscores a robust framework for technological exchange and capacity building.

In Sri Lanka, the project deployed 262 Solar Powered Renewable Energy Technology Applications across five provinces, benefiting over 233 stakeholders, including vulnerable groups and women. Key outcomes include the establishment of an Energy Data Management System (EDMS) and the development of Provincial Energy Plans for the agriculture sector.

Reflecting on the project’s impact, Ms. Azusa Kubota, Resident Representative of UNDP Sri Lanka, praised its role in advancing Sri Lanka’s greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and supporting local communities.

From the Chinese perspective, Chen Qizhen of the Administrative Center for China’s Agenda 21 highlighted the collaborative efforts in promoting green, low-carbon development through technology transfer and innovation.

Ms. Charu Bist, Deputy Resident Representative of UNDP Ethiopia, underscored the project’s significance in addressing energy access deficits and promoting social equality in Ethiopia.

Ms. Beate Trankmann, Resident Representative of UNDP in China, emphasized the critical contribution of such partnerships amid global challenges in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and climate action.

The initiative exemplifies the spirit of South-South cooperation, fostering solidarity among nations towards achieving internationally agreed development goals, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, observers said.
