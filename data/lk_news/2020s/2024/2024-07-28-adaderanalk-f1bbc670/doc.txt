CAA to enforce controlled bread price from next week

The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) has announced that a controlled price will be imposed for bread starting next week, if the vendors fail to sell a 450-gram loaf of bread at a fixed price of Rs 130.

Director of the Raids and Special Investigation Department of the CAA Sanjay Irasinghe stated that non-compliance with the fixed price for bread could result in fines ranging from Rs. 100,000 for small shops and Rs. 500,000 to Rs. 5 million for larger companies or bakeries.

The consumers frequently complain about the lack of fixed prices and inconsistent weights of bread. In response, the Consumer Affairs Authority has been conducting raids time to time in order to address these issues.

On February 02, the CAA issued a gazette notification mandating that the minimum weight of a loaf of bread should be 450 grams, and a half loaf should weigh at least 225 grams.

Against this backdrop, the All Ceylon Bakery Ownersâ€™ Association recently announced a reduction in the price of a 450-gram loaf of bread by Rs 10, effective from midnight on Friday (July 26).
