Addressing gender inequality key priority for Sri Lanka: ADB

As Sri Lanka looks to reach higher growth aspirations, addressing gender inequality is a key priority, the Asian Development Bank said.

In an economically active population of 8.5 million in 2022, female labour force participation in Sri Lanka was only 32.1 percent, down from 33.6 percent in 2018 prior to the economic crisis.

Key reasons for this include lack of safe and affordable childcare facilities, inadequate provision for flexible working hours, onerous household responsibilities and care duties socially imposed on women, and public transport inadequacies for women.

“While the private sector has addressed these shortcomings to some extent, the government can tackle gender inequality through a more supportive framework for female labour participation by introducing flexible work hours and mandating equal pay, the ADB said in its recent outlook report.

The Manila based lender stressed that reforming labour laws is also essential to formalise informal employment and protect workers from exploitation.

Given the absence of an employment-linked support system, a contributory unemployment insurance scheme and related laws may be considered,” the ADB said.
