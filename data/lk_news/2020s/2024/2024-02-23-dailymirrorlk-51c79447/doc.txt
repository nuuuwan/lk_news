Controversial ’white only’ party cancelled amid public outcry

Feb 23 (Daily Mirror) - A controversial 'white only' themed party scheduled to take place on February 24 at a Russian run cafe in the south has been cancelled by its organizers following widespread public backlash.

The event, which was promoted as an 'Opening White Party,' stirred significant controversy due to its discriminatory nature. Organizers intended to implement a face control policy where entry would be restricted solely to individuals deemed fitting by bouncers based on their white skin, wealth, style, or demeanor.

'Face control,' a term commonly used in upscale nightclubs, refers to the practice of regulating entry based on subjective assessments of individuals' appearances and social status.

Announcing the cancellation on Instagram, the organizers cited escalating concerns about racism as the primary reason behind their decision. In a post, they expressed regret for the hurt feelings caused by the event's concept and apologized to those offended by the idea.

"We decided to have a small White Party on 24/02 with white face control in a Russian cafe and received a lot of aggression against the background of an inflated opinion about racism. THE WHITE PARTY IS CANCELED!!! I apologize to everyone whose feelings were hurt," read the statement.

Reports indicated that the event organizers had planned to enforce strict entry criteria, including an entrance fee of Rs 3000, solely permitting participation from individuals meeting certain racial and financial qualifications.
