Sarvajana Balaya to hold first political rally in Nugegoda today

Hints two additional parties may join their coalition during meeting

Sarvajana Balaya is set to hold its inaugural political rally today in Nugegoda, aiming to reignite the support of the 6.9 million voters who previously backed a better future for the country. During the meeting, it is hinted that two additional parties may join their coalition.

Holding a media briefing, Mawbima Janatha Party (MJP) leader Dilith Jayaweera expressed readiness to rekindle the enthusiasm of those voters.

He stressed that none of the Sarvajana Balaya representatives were responsible for the downfall of the previous regime, attributing the failure to the Rajapaksa family’s inability to meet the people’s expectations.

Jayaweera specifically blamed Basil Rajapaksa’s liberal ideologies for the regime’s collapse.

“The 6.9 million voters symbolise those who love the country,” Jayaweera stated.

He said there is no option for the people of the country other than rallying around Sarvajana Balaya.

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila revealed that two additional parties will join their coalition at the meeting, inviting people to participate in the rally to see the groups.

“All bottles in different colours have the same old poison,” he said, metaphorically noting that the people need to transform this ‘poison’ into a ‘victory drink’.

Jathika Nidahas Peramunia leader and MP Weerawansa, Yuuthukama group leader and MP Gevinudu Kumaratunga, Independent MPs Forum MP Prof. Channa Jayasumana, Communist Party General Secretary Dr. G. Weerasinghe, and Democratic Left Front Deputy Secretary D.V. Thilakasiri also spoke at the media briefing.

On 27 May, the Mawbima Janatha Pakshaya signed a policy agreement with several political groups, forming a new coalition. This movement is expected to field a candidate in the upcoming Presidential election.
