India lodges strong opposition against death of poaching fisherman

The Indian External Affairs Ministry has summoned the Sri Lankan Acting High Commissioner in New Delhi to lodge a strong protest over an incident involving the Sri Lankan Navy and an Indian fishing boat.

A collision, which occurred on Thursday(01) morning, five nautical miles north of Katchatheevu Island, resulted in the death of one Indian fisherman and left another missing.

The Indian fishermen were reportedly engaged in illegal poaching activities at the time of the incident.

Out of the four fishermen on board, two were rescued and brought ashore to Kankesanthurai by the Sri Lankan Navy. A search operation is ongoing for the missing fisherman.

The Indian Ministry of External Affairs has emphasised that the safety and security of Indian fishermen are of the highest priority. Indian Consulate officials in Jaffna have been instructed to provide immediate assistance to the fishermen and their families.

The Ministry also expressed shock and anguish over the loss of life and stated that the Indian High Commissioner in Colombo would address the matter with the Sri Lankan Government.

The Indian Government reiterated its commitment to addressing fishermen-related issues humanely and stressed that existing agreements between the two Governments must be strictly observed to prevent such incidents and avoid the use of force.

Despite ongoing dialogues between the two governments and frequent arrests of Indian fishermen, they have continued to engage in poaching activities in Sri Lankan waters over the years.
