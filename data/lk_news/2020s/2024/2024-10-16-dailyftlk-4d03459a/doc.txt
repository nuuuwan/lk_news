The event not only showcases Sri Lankan creativity but also emphasises the link between fashion and automotive design.

Linda Speldewinde: This year is a big one for us not just because of the 15-year milestone, but because we’re stepping into a new era. Partnering with DIMO for MBFWSL adds a fresh dynamic, blending fashion with innovation and luxury. It’s exciting to see how these global brands align with our vision, bringing something new to the table and elevating the way we showcase Sri Lankan talent. This collaboration isn’t just about a show, it’s about setting the stage for the future of fashion and design in Sri Lanka. We’re taking what we’ve built over the years and pushing it forward in new and exciting ways further building the ‘designed and made in Sri Lanka’ label to be synonymous with sustainability, high-end design, and material innovation in the eyes of international fashion with the ‘Innovation Island’ theme. It’s not just a fashion show; it’s a statement about where Sri Lanka is heading as a creative hub for South Asia.

Rajeev: Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week provides a platform for Sri Lankan designers to collaborate with a globally recognised brand, enhancing their international visibility. This association allows local fashion talent to gain recognition on the global stage.

Both DIMO and our long-standing partner Mercedes-Benz for 85+ years share a deep commitment to sustainability, innovation, and quality—values that are also integral to the fashion industry. With this glamorous platform, we’re showcasing the country’s ability to innovate and create high-quality, sustainable lifestyles, reinforcing Sri Lanka’s image as a hub for creativity and innovation in the global marketplace.

This event will open doors for strategic partnerships that can elevate local talent while reinforcing Sri Lanka’s status as a fashion destination for high-quality, luxury, and innovation.

Linda: Fashion has an incredible ability to tell new stories, and that’s exactly what we’re doing this year with Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week. It is a platform that highlights Sri Lanka’s resilience, driven by creativity and innovation.

This year, we are featuring a diverse lineup of local and regional designers who blend traditional craftsmanship with modern design, alongside the cutting-edge apparel industry and emerging young talent, all demonstrating the evolving narrative of Sri Lankan fashion.

While Mercedes-Benz brings global attention and the connection to luxury, we’re leveraging that spotlight to highlight something even more powerful: Sri Lanka as a vibrant hub for creativity and collaboration. We are attracting international influencers, paving the way for new opportunities and connections in the global fashion landscape through Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week.

Q: Rajeev, DIMO has had a longstanding relationship with Mercedes-Benz. How do events like Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week highlight the synergy between luxury, design, and innovation?

Rajeev: Mercedes-Benz has always been synonymous with luxury, while consistently driving innovation through cutting-edge design. DIMO, as the exclusive authorised General Distributor for Mercedes-Benz in Sri Lanka (DIMO, The Home for Mercedes-Benz), has upheld a legacy of automotive excellence for over 85+ years, consistently introducing groundbreaking innovations to the local industry.

Fashion and luxury automotive design share a natural synergy—both demand precision, creativity, and a future-proof mindset. DIMO’s partnership with AOD for Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week perfectly embodies this synergy, reinforcing our commitment to fostering the next generation of creative talent. By aligning with a global leader in luxury and innovation, we aim to set new benchmarks in the local fashion industry, positioning Sri Lanka as a hub for world-class design and creativity. Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week catalyses this vision.

Additionally, the community that appreciates both fashion and luxury has been with DIMO for over eight decades, and this year is about reconnecting these like-minded individuals.

Q: Linda, you’ve been a strong advocate for pushing Sri Lankan talent into the global limelight. How do you see Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week serving as a launchpad for young designers?

Linda: Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week is an unparalleled platform for Sri Lankan designers, providing young talent with the opportunity to interact with international markets and gain exposure to global standards. AOD graduate, Amesh Wijesekera is a perfect example, where his collection at MBFWSL won the award for IDEP, Mercedes-Benz International Designer Exchange. Entry into this program, along with the mentoring support for emerging talent from around the world by Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Global, led him to be the first Sri Lankan designer to showcase at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Berlin, a pivotal moment in his career. MBFWSL continues to offer such opportunities, elevating the next generation of designers and showing the world that Sri Lanka is brimming with creativity and potential.

Q: Rajeev, Mercedes-Benz is globally renowned for blending luxury with sustainability. DIMO also plays a crucial role at the national level in endorsing sustainability.  How do Mercedes-Benz and DIMO align with Sri Lanka’s goals for a greener future?

Rajeev: Mercedes-Benz exemplifies how luxury and sustainability can coexist, proving that sophistication need not come at the environment’s expense. As an example, the Mercedes-Benz EQ range, with its sleek designs and advanced electric powertrains, represents a new era of automotive innovation, blending elegance with eco-friendly materials and energy-efficient technologies. As the exclusive partner of Mercedes-Benz in Sri Lanka, DIMO plays a pivotal role in building a sustainable ecosystem, offering comprehensive solutions from electric vehicles to home charging and solar power installations. This aligns perfectly with Mercedes-Benz’s sustainability strategy “Mercedes-Benz AG’s Ambition 2039” and Sri Lanka’s national goals for renewable energy and green technology. Both the fashion and automotive sectors can drive sustainability forward, and this event highlights the synergy between global initiatives and local efforts.

Q: Linda, Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Sri Lanka has evolved over the years, what new elements can we expect this year, and how do they contribute to the long-term vision of making Sri Lanka South Asia’s creative hub?

Linda: Hosting this year’s event at Cinnamon Life, alongside the Sri Lanka Design Festival, aligns perfectly with our goal, positioning Sri Lanka as South Asia’s creative industries hub. By merging fashion, art, and music, we’re fostering a cultural dialogue that inspires and elevates the creative industries in the region, ultimately contributing to our vision of making Sri Lanka a creative epicentre in South Asia.

This year, we are also excited to unveil several dynamic elements that will elevate the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week experience. A standout feature will be the Mercedes-Benz Lounge, which will serve as an exclusive networking space and showcase Mercedes-Benz Art, highlighting the remarkable works of the esteemed artist Anoma Wijewardene as the Mercedes-Benz Art spotlight artist 2024. Her powerful and thought-provoking pieces reflect our commitment to integrating art into the fashion narrative.  Furthermore, the event will maintain a strong connection to music, underscoring Mercedes-Benz’s standing connection to music and how it influences and enriches the fashion experience. This synergy between fashion and music is essential as we aim to create a vibrant event that resonates with creativity and innovation at Colombo’s new fashion address, the Cinnamon Life at City of Dreams Sri Lanka.

Q: What do you hope Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week 2024 will leave behind for the future years, both for the Sri Lankan creative industries and the global fashion community?

Rajeev: For over eight decades, DIMO has transformed Sri Lanka’s luxury automotive sector in partnership with Mercedes-Benz, setting new standards in innovation. We aim to showcase how luxury and innovation can integrate, establishing Sri Lanka as a beacon for cutting-edge design and craftsmanship. We hope the legacy of Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week 2024 will be one of pioneering innovation and collaboration in Sri Lanka that will elevate the local creative industries and international fashion sphere.

Moreover, our commitment to supporting local talent, through initiatives that merge fashion with art and music, will create a dynamic platform that inspires not only our local industries but also resonates globally. We envision this event as a catalyst for ongoing partnerships, elevating Sri Lanka’s profile in the global fashion community and driving economic growth through the creative sectors.

Linda: MBFW 2024 is to be a powerful testament to the transformative potential of the creative industries as a pathway to make a contribution to Sri Lanka’s economic revival. This event should ignite passion and ambition in the next generation of designers, artists, and innovators, encouraging them to push the boundaries of creativity.
