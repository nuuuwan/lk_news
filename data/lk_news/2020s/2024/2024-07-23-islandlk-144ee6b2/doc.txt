Explaining further, Charith Goonetilleke Managing Director of Laundroplus said, “We are so pleased to be associated with a project like TRI-ZEN and to collaborate with the reputed John Keells Properties. Laundroplus also operates and manages the laundry facility of the Cinnamon Grand Hotel and has built a strong reputation for quality laundry services and we are now pleased to bring this expertise to the residents at TRI-ZEN too. Our well experienced and professional staff will be present to assist customers to operate the self-service washer and dryers if needed, or they can process the laundry on their behalf. In the event any resident requires a full laundry service that includes pressing and drycleaning services, the items will be transferred to our facility at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel for processing and returned for collection from our outlet at TRI-ZEN. Laundroplus offers the advantage of notifying customers through the Laundroplus laundry App or via SMS when their laundry is ready for collection, significantly reducing valuable time spent on doing laundry.”
