Thai Airways resumes operations to Sri Lanka

After a four-year hiatus, Thai Airways flight TG 307 arrived at Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake at 11.55 p.m. on Monday (01).

Originating from Bangkok, Thailand, the flight carried approximately 150 foreign tourists, including Thai nationals. According to Katunayake airport authorities, flights between Thailand and Sri Lanka are now operating daily.

Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Minister of Ports, Shipping & Aviation welcomed the flight and its passengers at the arrival terminal.

A special cultural dance performance had also been organized by the Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd. (AASL) to commemorate the occasion and welcome the flight and passengers. Several officials, including Eng. Athula Galketiya, the AASL chairman were in attendance at the event.

Addressing the gathering, Minister de Silva highlighted the increasing number of tourists visiting Sri Lanka in 2024, noting that nearly 800,000 tourists had arrived in the island from the BIA over the past three months alone.

He expressed confidence that the introduction of daily flights by Thai Airways would further boost tourist arrivals. Additionally, he proposed that reduced airfare could attract more Sri Lankan travellers to visit Thailand, thereby fostering increased bilateral tourism.
