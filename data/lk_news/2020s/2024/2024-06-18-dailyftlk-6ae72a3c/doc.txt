AG tenure expansion not within CC scope – G.L.

MP Prof. G.L. Peiris highlights absence of any precedent for extending an Attorney General’s term

Expresses concern that extending current AG’s term would prevent first female AG from being appointed

Accuses Govt. of shifting responsibility to CC after failing to lay blame on Catholic Church for AG tenure extension

Freedom People’s Congress MP Prof. G.L. Peiris claimed yesterday that extending the term of office of the Attorney General is not within the Constitutional Council’s purview.

At a press conference, Peiris noted that while the Constitutional Council is set to meet today to decide on the matter, this decision is outside its jurisdiction.

“This matter does not fall within the scope of the Constitutional Council. The Council lacks both the power and responsibility to address it,” the MP said.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe has proposed extending Attorney General Sanjay Rajaratnam’s tenure by six months. However, the Constitutional Council failed to decide on the matter last week, leading to a postponement.

The MP pointed out that in the last 76 years, there has been no precedent for extending the term of an Attorney General. Peiris firmly said that such an extension should not be considered.

Peiris also accused the Government of transferring responsibility to the Constitutional Council after an unsuccessful attempt to extend the Attorney General’s term, alleging it was done under pressure from the Catholic Church.

The MP expressed concern that extending the current Attorney General’s term of office would hinder the historic opportunity for a woman to become Attorney General for the first time in Sri Lanka.

“If Sanjay Rajaratnam is given another 6 months, it will deny the opportunity for the current Solicitor General, a woman, to hold the position of Attorney General for the first time in the history of this country,” Peiris noted.
