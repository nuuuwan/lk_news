President Anura Kumara Dissanayake declared that will be no room for racial politics of religious extremism hereafter in the country.

He made these comments while delivering the Government’s Policy Statement during the inaugural session of the 10th Parliament on Thursday (21).

The President said that all the people who voted for the NPP and those who didn’t are citizens of the country and that fulfilling the needs and expectations of all these citizens is the responsibility of the government.

“Therefore, our government and I are duty-bound and committed to fulfill the needs of the people,” he said.

The President further vowed that both he and the government will not allow the relationship with the country’s people to be affected and said that they are bound and committed to continue this governance.

He stated that a major opportunity has now emerged to build national unity in the country, which has been an aspiration of the people for a long time.

“We can have various political views and opinions. But I will tell you one thing with responsibility; racial politics will not be allowed in the country again.”

“At the same time, no form of religious extremism will be allowed to raise its head,” he declared.

“We are a people who have been affected by more than enough racial tensions.” He stated that enough blood has been spilled and enough tears have been shed over such conflicts.

“It is the responsibility of us all who are representing this parliament, to ensure that such a nation is not created for the future generations,” he added.

“We can have any slogans to engage in politics, be it economic slogans or democratic slogans. However, I assure you that no one will be allowed to utilize racist and extremist slogans to come into power again in the country hereafter.”
