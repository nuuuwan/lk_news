Sri Lanka urged on banking recapitalization, property tax by IMF mission

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka was urged to take action on bank recapitalization, property tax and an anti-corruption commission when a visiting International Monetary Fund mission met President Ranil Wickremesinghe, his media office said.

Focus areas included a new public financial management law, potential conflicts with the public-private partnership law, electricity tariffs and urgent preparations for property taxation, the statement said.

“The meeting also highlighted the urgency of addressing fiscal matters, including passing amendments to the Banking Act and recapitalizing the banking sector,” the statement said.

“On the governance front, operationalizing the Anti-Corruption Commission, publishing action plans and meeting with the Constitutional Council for insights into commissioner selection processes were discussed.”

Senior Mission Chief Peter Breuer was quoted as saying that revenue collections were up and reforms were working. (Colombo/Jan12/2023)
