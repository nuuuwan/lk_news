Sri Lanka’s ruling NPP wins LG poll sans majority

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s ruling National People’s Power (NPP) won a solitary local government poll held on Saturday (26), but failed to secure a majority, the election results showed.

PresidentvAnura Kumara Dissanayake-led NPP secured 15 out of 30 seats in the long delayed Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha (PS) poll, leaving it to depend on another party’s support to rule the local government authority.

Out of the total votes polled, the NPP secured only 47.6 percent in Elpitiya in the Southern district of Galle where the NPP won a convincing 51.4 percent of the total votes in the last month presidential elections.

Dissanayake’s NPP has sought a majority from the people at the November 14 parliamentary polls to implement strong anti-corruption measures it promised for the past few years.(Colombo/October 27/2024)
