Iran helicopter crash: President Ebrahim Raisi dies

Bell Helicopter (now Bell Textron) developed the aircraft in the late 1960s as an upgrade of the original UH-1 Iroquois for the Canadian military.

The new design used two turboshaft engines instead of one, giving it greater carrying capacity.

According to US military training documents, the helicopter was introduced in 1971 and quickly adopted by both the United States and Canada.

The craft is designed to carry aerial firefighting gear and cargo and to mount weapons.

This particular helicopter had been reconfigured to carry 15 people, including a pilot.

Sanctions have made it difficult for Iran to obtain parts or new aircraft.
