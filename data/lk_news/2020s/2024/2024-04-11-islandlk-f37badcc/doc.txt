SriLankan Airlines elevates Ground Handling with State-of-the-Art equipment upgrade

SriLankan Airlines, the exclusive ground operator at Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), has initiated a phased upgrade of airport ground support equipment to accommodate the rising influx of flights and travellers transiting through the airport. Recently, the airline acquired three state-of-the-art passenger apron coaches, ensuring optimal comfort for passengers during transfers between the terminal and remote stands.

With airport traffic steadily increasing and nearing pre-pandemic levels, acquiring modern ground support equipment has become an urgent priority for SriLankan Airlines. This investment aims to ensure a seamless end-to-end travel experience for customers.

“It is an exciting time for Sri Lanka’s tourism industry; the number of visitors has doubled over the past year. We are delighted to introduce these modern apron coaches, along with other new ground support equipment, to our services at Colombo airport during this pivotal point. Our commitment to providing our passengers and the passengers of our customer airlines with a reliable and effortless travel experience remains steadfast, as does our dedication to supporting the national tourism strategy. With these incremental advancements, we anticipate substantial transformation in our operations,” stated Senior Manager Airport and Ground Services of SriLankan Airlines, Deepal Pallegangoda.

The passenger apron coaches, and ground support equipment were procured following a comprehensive and transparent competitive bidding procedure, consistent with all procurement exercises of the airline. The coaches, sourced from China International Marine Containers, represent the latest in comfort and technology. These operational enhancements will empower SriLankan Airlines to elevate both the standard of ground support services and the comfort of passengers at the airport.
