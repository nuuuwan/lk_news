Sri Lanka to re-start subsidy to keep senior citizen deposit rate at 10-pct

ECONOMYNEXT â€“ Sri Lanka will re-start and subsidy scheme for senior citizens to keep fixed deposit returns at 10 percent a year, Minister Bandula Gunawardana said.

Market rates are now starting to fall and the government will top up the rate to keep interest yield at 10 percent, he said.

The subsidies are being promised ahead of elections in September.

The subsidy would apply to deposits of up to one million rupees for two years, according to a statement.

The budget impact was not known but if the fixed deposit rate fell to 8.5-pct the balance would be topped up by the subsidy, he said.

Sri Lanka started interest subsidies to keep rates at 15 percent but terminated them after rates cuts triggered currency trouble and stabilization required very high rates.

Pension anomalies of 83,000 retirees would also be solved, he said. The cost to the tax payers is not known. (Colombo/Aug05/2024)
