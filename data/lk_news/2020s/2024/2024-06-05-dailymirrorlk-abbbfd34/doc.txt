Some 800 tons of plastic products thrown into rivers in Sri Lanka

June 05 (Daily Mirror) - Some 800 tons of plastic products are thrown into Sri Lanka's rivers annually, Chairman of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Environment, MP Ajith Mannapperuma said today.

The MP made this remark during the launch of a plastic bottle recycling project in Parliament this afternoon. Bins to throw plastic bottles were provided by Coca Cola Sri Lanka Ltd. to mark World Environment Day. The bottles are to be purchased by Eco Spindle Ltd. The proceeds are to be credited to the account of the Parliament Welfare Association.

"Over 1,600 plastic products are imported to Sri Lanka annually. Over 400 tons are exported while 800 tons are thrown into rivers. The Eco project in Parliament is important in that context," MP Mannapperuma said.

Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena welcomed and lauded the project and said it is the duty of all to preserve the environment.

Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa stressed the importance of managing disposal of plastics through creative methods.
