Hamilton Reserve had objected to the case, Bloomberg Newswires reported.

Hamilton Reserve had objected saying, Sri Lanka was not keeping it informed of the progress of discussions with bondholders.

Meanwhile another bondholder, Ultimate Concrete and Intercoastal Finance has intervened, sri Lanka’s Daily FT newspaper reported.

Judge Denise Cote had given till March 15 for Hamilton Reserve to reply and till March 22 for the intervenient petitioner also to reply if it wanted to.

On Friday, Sri Lanka sought an extension of a delay of the lawsuit that was granted in November. Hamilton Reserve opposed the new request, saying that the country has kept the bank “in the dark” about the negotiations despite repeated requests for information. (Colombo/Mar04/2024)
