Health sector trade unions call-off strike

The collective of health sector trade unions have decided to call off their ongoing strike action, the Health Trade Union Alliance said.

The 72 health sector trade unions have agreed to end the trade union action, launched over disparities in allowances, after Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana had agreed for a discussion with them on Monday (Feb. 19).

Accordingly, the strike is to be suspended at 6.30 a.m. tomorrow (15), the trade unions said.
