SL to ink MoU with China on wheat bran export to boost foreign exchange

In a bid to streamline the export of wheat bran, the Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Sri Lanka’s Agriculture and Plantation Industries Ministry and the General Administration of Customs of the People’s Republic of China.

In wheat flour production, around 20% of the bran is removed from imported wheat seeds. The removed bran, processed into Wheat Bran Pellets, holds significant potential for export, offering Sri Lanka an opportunity to earn substantial foreign exchange.

The consent of the Foreign Affairs Ministry was also given to the drafted MoU.

The proposal submitted by Agriculture and Plantation Industries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
