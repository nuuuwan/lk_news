Defence Ministry clearance mandatory for ex-servicemen traveling to Russia

Colombo, May 29 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka has announced that Russia will now require clearance from the Sri Lanka Defence Ministry for issuing visit visas to ex-servicemen.

This decision was made following a constructive meeting between Sri Lanka's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ali Sabry, and the Russian Ambassador to Colombo, His Excellency Levan S. Dzhagaryan.

The discussions focused on the urgent issue of Sri Lankans being deployed in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. Both parties agreed on the necessity of immediate steps to address and resolve these pressing concerns. The new visa clearance requirement is part of these measures aimed at regulating and monitoring the involvement of Sri Lankan nationals in the conflict.

Further, the upcoming visit by the Honorable State Minister of Foreign Affairs to Russia is expected to facilitate further dialogue and efforts to find a comprehensive solution to this matter.
