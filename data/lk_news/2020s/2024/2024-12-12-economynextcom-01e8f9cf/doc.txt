Wasantha Batagoda leaves Sri Lanka’s DFCC Bank

ECONOMYNEXT – Wasantha Batagoda, the LOLC Group nominee, will resign from the DFCC Bank board on December 19, the company said.

Batagoda was on the DFCC Bank board as Non-Independent Non-Executive Director since LOLC acquired a 10 percent stake in the development bank in 2022.

Last month LOLC Holdings divested its 9.73 percent of ordinary voting shares held in DFCC Bank through subsidiary LOLC Investment Holdings Three (Private) Limited for 3.5 billion rupees. (Colombo/Dec12/2024)
