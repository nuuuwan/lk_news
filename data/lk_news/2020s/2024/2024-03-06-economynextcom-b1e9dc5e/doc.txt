Kumarasinghe said her ministry had also completed the construction of 12 protection centers for women.

“We have currently completed the construction of 12 protection centers,” Kumarasinghe said in parliament on Tuesday in response to an opposition legislator’s query. “Women can stay in these centers (randavum madyasthana) for upto three months.”

The centers will offer women suffering from domestic abuse, who have nowhere to go if they leave their homes, a temporary respite.

According to the Department of Census and Statistics 65.8 per cent of victims of grave sexual abuse in the 2015-2019 were women. (Colombo/Mar6/20024)
