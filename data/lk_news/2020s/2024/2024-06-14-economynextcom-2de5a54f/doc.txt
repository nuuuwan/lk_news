ECONOMYNEXT — The United States has welcomed the International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s approval of the second review of Sri Lanka’s IMF programme which allows for the disbursement of 330 million US dollars.

US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung tweeted Friday June 14 that her government encourages Sri Lanka’s leaders to stay committed to measures needed to foster growth.

“Recognising that reforms can be challenging, the United States continues to encourage Sri Lanka’s leaders to stay committed to take needed measures that ensure accountability, transparency, and representative governance, to foster investment and growth,” she said.

Chung met State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe in Washington at the IMF Spring Meeting in April where she said Sri Lanka had made “great progress”.

“Pleasure to see State Minister Semasinghe ahead of his trip to Washington for the IMF Spring Meeting, an opportunity for policymakers, economists, and stakeholders to collaborate on finding solutions to global economic challenges and promote international economic cooperation.

“Sri Lanka has made great progress on the IMF program, and we hope Sri Lanka can take the final steps necessary to unlock the next round of funding that will promote economic stability, foster growth, and improve the welfare of the people of Sri Lanka,” she tweeted at that,” said.
