International Coaching Week to feature 20 global experts

International Coaching Week is a free week-long virtual event for both aspiring and established coaches, hosted by The International Authority for Professional Coaching and Mentoring (IAPC&M).

It will be from 13 to 17 May 2024. And anyone can join using the link https://coach-accreditation.services/icw-event/

It’s no secret, the coaching industry is well and truly on the rise, but did you know it’s the second fastest industry in the US behind IT? This means more people than ever need coaches! However, the coaching world is an unregulated market.

Luckily, The International Authority for Professional Coaching and Mentoring (IAPC&M) is stepping up as a true leading expert. One of the reasons IAPC&M was founded in the first place is that as more and more people become coaches and mentors, standards are slipping in the industry. They are here to raise the standards in the industry!

They are doing this by ensuring everyone has access to the high-quality training and accreditation required to be a skilled and effective coach and make a positive impact on their client’s lives.

IAPC&M is passionate about raising the standards in the industry, and in doing so, making sure you have the training and support you need to thrive as a coach or mentor.

You’re an aspiring coach who wants to learn more about the foundations of launching and growing a successful, sustainable business.

You’re already in the coaching world and actively growing your business and want to know more about laying down the foundations of your dream business.
