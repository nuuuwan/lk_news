At least 8 injured after bus topples in Nanu Oya

Eight people have been injured after a bus toppled on Radella Shortcut Road in Nanu Oya on Thursday night (Feb.22).

As many as 35 passengers including the driver had been inside the vehicle at the time of the accident.

The injured were rushed to the Nuwara-Eliya District General Hospital for treatment. According to the police, two of them have since been discharged while the remaining six are still under medical care.

The bus was reportedly carrying a group of pilgrims from Akuressa, Galle and Weherahena areas.

Nanu Oya Police is conducting further investigations into the incident.

The accident happened a year after a fatal multiple-vehicle collision on the Radella Shortcut Road claimed the lives of seven people including 2 children and injured at least 53 others. The deadly accident was caused by the careless driving of a bus driver transporting a group of students returning from a school trip to Nuwara Eliya on January 20, 2023.

The bus in question had fallen down a 100-foot precipice along the Radella Shortcut Road after colliding with a van and a three-wheeler.

Just weeks after the fatal crash, in February 2023, another accident took place on Radella Shortcut Road, critically injuring three individuals.
