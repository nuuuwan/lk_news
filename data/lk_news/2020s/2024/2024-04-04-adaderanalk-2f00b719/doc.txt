68 suspects arrested over torching of Sanath Nishantha’s house released

The Chillaw Magistrate’s Court has ordered the release of all 68 individuals who were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the torching of late State Minister Sanath Nishantha’s residence.

Attorney-at-Law Sweeney Perera, who appeared on behalf of the aforementioned suspects, stated that this order was issued by the Chillaw Magistrate today (04) when the case was taken up.

He further stated that the court decided to release all the suspects of the case due to the death of both witnesses in the case and the failure of the police to present any evidence against the accused to the court.
