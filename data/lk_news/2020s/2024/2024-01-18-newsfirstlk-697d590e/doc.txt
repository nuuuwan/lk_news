Sri Lankaâ€™s Police Get Tough on Internal Drug Use

COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lanka's Acting Inspector General of Police, Deshabandu Thennakoon, has declared a zero-tolerance policy towards drug use within the police force.

Addressing reporters today, the IGP acknowledged investigations into internal drug use over the years have yielded "unsatisfactory results," prompting a decisive shift in approach.

"While we are relentlessly cracking down on criminals who plague our streets," Thennakoon stated, "we have also detected a worrying trend of drug use within some members of our own force."

The new policy involves mandatory medical examinations for all police personnel.

"Following proper medical assessments," the IGP declared, "every officer found to be involved with drugs will be dismissed from the service within a month."
