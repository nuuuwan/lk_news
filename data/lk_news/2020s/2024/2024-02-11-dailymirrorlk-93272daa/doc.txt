Air quality in multiple cities deteriorates

Colombo, Feb 11 (Daily Mirror) - The air quality in several regions across the island has plunged to unhealthy levels, the National Building Research Organization (NBRO) said.

According to their latest assessment, apart from Nuwara Eliya, all other districts are grappling with unhealthy air conditions, with Colombo, Akurana in Kandy, and Jaffna registering notably high levels of pollution.

Citing data from the US Air Quality Index (AQI), the NBRO highlighted eight districts—Colombo, Kilinochchi, Jaffna, Trincomalee, Badulla, Kurunegala, Kandy, and Matale—as areas where the air quality poses significant health risks.

The organization cautioned that individuals with respiratory ailments, such as asthma, as well as active children and adults, are especially vulnerable and advised them to minimize outdoor activities.
