Sri Lanka SEC inks deal with Maldives for Colombo cross listings

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Securities and Exchange Commission said it had inked a deal with the capital market regulator in Maldives to allow cross listings of companies in Colombo.

The agreement with the Capital Market Development Authority of Maldives (CMDA) primarily covers secondary listings by Maldivian companies on the Colombo Stock exchange (CSE), and extends to mutual collaboration, capacity building assistance and regulatory information exchanges between the two capital market regulators to ensure compliance with laws and regulations across both jurisdictions.

“Maldivian companies can benefit significantly from listing on the CSE, by embracing best practices of listed companies in Sri Lanka, access a wider pool of investors, leverage on our capital market infrastructure and achieve more accurate valuations for their stocks given the liquidity challenges at home,” SEC Chairman Faizal Salieh said.

Salieh also said there was opportunity for listing debt instruments such as Sukuks, Sustainable Bonds and Development Bonds, and secondary listing of SOEs.

“Under the MOU, we will explore new access to finance alternatives for local companies, harmonize regulatory frameworks, and integrate systems for cross-border trading activities. Improving the governance of listed companies is also a key area of focus,” CMDA Chairperson Aishath Zahira said.

Following the signing of the MOU the CSE conducted a series of one-on-one meetings with several Maldivian listed companies including Amana Takaful Maldives Plc, Centurion Plc, Maldives Islamic Bank Plc, Maldives Transport and Contracting Company Plc, Dhiraagu Plc and Maldives Tourism Development Corporation.

By working together, both nations aim to create a conducive environment for sustainable growth, attract more investments, and enhance the prosperity of their capital markets and economies, the SEC said in a statement. (Colombo/Jul24/2024)
