Sri Lanka steps up measures for fighting tuberculosis

Sri Lanka’s Cabinet approved a proposal to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to study the effectiveness of a new treatment model to tuberculosis, according to the government’s information department.

The MoU will be signed between the country’s Sri Jayewardenepura University and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (IUATLD).

According to the department, tuberculosis is the second most infectious disease in Sri Lanka and the leading cause of death from such illnesses.

In 2021, a guideline was prepared for Sri Lanka following the World Health Organization’s recommendation on tuberculosis preventive treatments, the department said on Saturday.

The department said it is expected to conduct a study to observe the effectiveness of the proposed treatment model under the national program for tuberculosis control and chest diseases.

The IUATLD has agreed to provide a financial grant of 387,280 U.S. dollars.
