Seylan Bank marks key milestone in enhancing students’ education

250th Seylan Pahasara library signifies persistent progress in 11-year journey

Seylan Bank recently unveiled its 250th Seylan Pahasara library at St. Anthony’s Tamil Maha Vidyalam in Colombo 14, marking a significant milestone in a mission to enhance literacy and education across Sri Lanka.

Since its inception over 11 years ago, the initiative has been a powerful catalyst for change, transforming the lives of countless Sri Lankan students, fostering community development and sustainable growth.

Launched in 2013, the Seylan Pahasara library project was conceived to address the educational needs of schools who are most in need due to the lack of access to resources and assistance. The initiative was introduced in conjunction with the Bank’s 25th anniversary and supports schools with low resources across the country, reflecting a broader vision of contributing to the nation’s future through education.

Seylan Bank Director/CEO Ramesh Jayasekara said: “The Seylan Pahasara library project has emerged as a bridge of hope extending beyond numbers and providing books. The impact has been profound, reaching over 330,000 children across Sri Lanka, benefiting from the program. The project’s reach spans across all nine provinces of Sri Lanka including both urban and rural areas. The wide distribution ensures that students across the country have access to these valuable resources.”

Focusing on the specific needs of each school, Seylan Pahasara libraries are enriched with computers and multimedia projectors. The carefully curated book selection aligns with the school curriculum but also covers a wide range of topics including sports, aesthetics, leadership, personal growth and creativity, broadening their horizons.

One of the project’s key strengths lies in its inclusive approach. The project’s reach extends to 15 boys-only schools, 40 girls-only schools, and 195 mixed schools, demonstrating its commitment to inclusive education. Seylan Pahasara libraries reach students from diverse backgrounds, enabling equal access to valuable resources irrespective of language, religion, or gender. The initiative supports level 5 schools across all districts, ensuring that no deserving school is left behind, regardless of its location or prestige. The inclusivity of the initiative has been a cornerstone of its success, helping to level the playing field for students from all walks of life.

Moreover, the project has become a platform for improving financial literacy, empowering students with essential knowledge and skills to navigate the complex world of finance.

The Seylan Pahasara libraries’ project has also fostered strong community bonds and local economic growth. Each library opening ceremony involves religious leaders, employees, customers, students, and teachers, creating an ecosystem of support and collaboration within towns and villages. Engaging local vendors and service providers for infrastructure development and furnishings such as library cupboards, tables, and chairs, the initiative stimulates the local economy. This approach ensures the project’s benefits are widely felt creating a sustainable cycle of community development.

The initiative also caters to various educational levels, from primary to schools offering education from Grade 1 to O/L, from Grade 1 to A/L, and schools covering Grade 6 to A/L. The diverse range ensures that students at all stages of their educational journey can benefit.

Despite challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which temporarily halted the project’s progress, Seylan Bank remained committed to its mission. The bank’s resilience and adaptability ensured that the initiative continued to grow and evolve, even in the face of adversity.

The bank’s employees have played a crucial role in the success of the initiative, contributing their time and effort to ensure each library meets the needs of the students it serves. The dedication has benefited the students and strengthened the bank’s connection to the communities it serves.

Looking ahead, Seylan Bank aims to establish 300 libraries by 2026, continuing its investment in Sri Lanka’s future. The Bank is also exploring the concept of e-libraries, in order to make learning more accessible to students in the digital age.

As Seylan Bank celebrates the 250th Seylan Pahasara library, it reaffirms its commitment to building a brighter future for students through education. It is also a testament to Seylan Bank’s commitment and dedication to transforming lives, representing a vision of banking that is inclusive, empowering future generations, and creating lasting change for all Sri Lankans.
