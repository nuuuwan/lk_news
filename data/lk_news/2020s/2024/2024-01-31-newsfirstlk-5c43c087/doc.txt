Police Detains 10 Protesters at CID Headquarters While Demanding Keheliyaâ€™s Arrest

COLOMBO (News 1st); Ten protesters, eight men and two women, were arrested today outside the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) headquarters in Colombo.

The group had been demonstrating since morning, demanding the arrest of former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella for his alleged involvement in a recent drug procurement scandal.

Police spokesperson DIG Nihal Talduwa confirmed the arrests and stated that despite repeated warnings and attempts to disperse the gathering peacefully, the protesters continued their sit-in protest, prompting police intervention.

Meanwhile, Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella issued a statement this afternoon acknowledging the summons from the CID but claiming his inability to present himself due to conflicting commitments.

He cited a scheduled appearance at the Colombo High Court in another case and his participation in a meeting of the Ministerial Sub-committee on Public Expenditure Management, chaired by the President, as reasons for his absence.
