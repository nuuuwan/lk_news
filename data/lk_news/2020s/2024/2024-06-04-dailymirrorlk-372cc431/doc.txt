Environmental organizations, certain politicians preventing permanent solutions to floods

Whilst highlighting that the government had come up with permanent solutions to prevent floods, State Minister Pramitha Bandara Tennekoon told Parliament today that it has become impossible to implement them because of environmental organizations and certain politicians.

The State Minister came out with this remark in response to requests by both ruling party and opposition MPs for a permanent solution to the floods which hit the South, Kalutara and the Gampaha district.

He also said that 26 persons have died due to inclement weather conditions while 130,021 persons from 33,422 families have been affected as of today.
