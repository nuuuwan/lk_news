Fairly heavy rainfall expected in 3 provinces including Western

Several spells of showers are likely in the Eastern, Uva, North-central and Northern provinces, the Department of Meteorology says.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places elsewhere in the island in the afternoon or at night.

Meanwhile, fairly heavy showers above 50mm are likely at some places in Western, Sabaragamuwa and North-western Provinces.

Misty conditions are expected at some places in Central, Sabaragamuwa and Uva provinces and in Galle and Matara districts during the morning.

Members of the public are urged to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
