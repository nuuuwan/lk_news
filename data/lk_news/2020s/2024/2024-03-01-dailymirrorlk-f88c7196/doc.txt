Experts say NO to sweet food and beverages for infants

Colombo, March 1 (Daily Mirror) - Health experts advise parents to avoid providing their children with sweet food and beverages before they turn two years as it could affect the baby’s development.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, Dr. Deepal Perera, a Paediatrician at the Lady Ridgeway Children's Hospital in Colombo said sweet food is only recommended after infants turn two while prioritizing breast-feeding during the first six months.

“Consumption of sugar-sweetened food and beverages is linked with increased risk of overweight or obesity,” Dr Perera stressed.

“Added sugars are used in processed foods and beverages to sweeten, and differ from the natural sugars that are part of a piece of fruit or glass of milk,” he underscored.

Thus, he reiterated the importance of prioritizing breastfeeding until children turn two.

Meanwhile, the health expert cautioned people to avoid consuming food and beverages with added sugars in light of rising temperatures.

“Amid the heatwave, people must abstain from consuming artificial beverages. Instead, natural beverages like king coconut lime juice, fruit juice are highly recommended,” he added.
