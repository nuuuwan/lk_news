Sri Lanka Port City dollarized zone eyed by 300 businesses

ECONOMYNEXT – Around 300 businesses have applied to start businesses in Sri Lanka’s Colombo Port City special economic zone, and about 50 are being processed, State Minister for Investment Dilum Amungama said.

The Colombo Port City Commission approves large investments such as those that invest in building as primary businesses of strategic importance which get investment incentives.

The cabinet has so far approved around 20 BSI firms and 50 are being in the process of being approved, Minister Amunugama said.

Minister Amunugama said approving financial businesses took some time, because the required regulations took some time to develop in partnership with the central bank.

There is a pipeline of 300 businesses who want to set up shop in the port city, he said.

Businesses can register to operate in the zone and do business internationally without tax benefits as an authorized person subject to applicable rules.

The port city is a dollarized special economic zone where its denizens will be protected from the depreciation and inflation coming from liquidity injections of the central bank or anchor conflicts.

The zone can use US dollars and a number of other currencies to pay people. And residents can keep the money in a currency that does not depreciate like the rupee ad prevent the evaporation of the value of savings. (Colombo/July01/2024)
