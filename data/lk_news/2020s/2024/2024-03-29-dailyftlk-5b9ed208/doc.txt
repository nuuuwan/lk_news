He also underscored the importance of experienced leadership in navigating the country’s challenges and suggested that Namal Rajapaksa may be better suited for Presidential candidacy in the future after gaining more experience.

Ranatunga emphasised the need to prioritise the country’s interests over political considerations, advocating for decisions that benefit the people of Sri Lanka.
