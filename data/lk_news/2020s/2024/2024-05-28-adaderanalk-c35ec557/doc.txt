Postponing elections not healthy for any democracy - Namal

Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa says that postponing elections is not healthy for any democracy.

The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) National Organiser stated that extending the terms of the President and the Parliament undermines the fundamental principles of a democratic society.

“Stability should come through the will of the people, not by delaying their voice,” he said in a post on ‘X’ (formerly Twitter).

Rajapaksa’s comments come likely in response to a statement made by the General Secretary of the United National Party (UNP) Palitha Range Bandara, proposing for the postponement of the two upcoming elections by two years.

Speaking at a press conference in Colombo today (28), he proposed that the Presidential Election and the General Election be postponed for 2 years, through a proposal to be tabled in Parliament and that a referendum could be called if necessary.

“Now we have to save the country from this bankruptcy and rebuild the country’s economy,” Range Bandara said.

He stated that Sri Lanka has an agreement in place with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and if the said agreement is violated the country will regress back to how it was two years back.

“So, do we want to knowingly go back to that point and get ruined? Or else do we reach a common agreement and postpone both these elections for two years?”

“The President is not greedy to stay on. We are the ones asking,” he said, adding that funds should not be wasted by going for a general election at this time.

“Postpone them both for two years. These issues can be resolved within those two years and afterwards elections can be held,” Range Bandara added.
