Strategic dance between Health Ministry, trade unions: Dr. Bellana

Colombo, May 14 (Daily Mirror) - The commencement of islandwide union actions has turned into a strategic interplay between Health Ministry officials and the collective health sector trade unions, the Government Medical Officers' Forum (GMOF) said today.

GMOF president Dr. Rukshan Bellana claimed that the Health Ministry wants the health unions to go on strike for them to be lenient on the demands to be granted. He claimed that the Health Secretary is encouraging the strikes.

A collective health sector trade union launched a token strike at all hospitals in the Central Province yesterday (13) over their demands, including an increase in allowances and said that the strike will be expanded to other provinces as well starting May 22 if their demands are not met.

"The Health Secretary has not yet taken action against the trade union leaders. Some of these leaders, currently under investigation, are actively participating in the ongoing trade union action, expressing concerns about potential expulsion from government service. However, the Health Secretary has chosen not to take immediate action. Instead, they are engaging in negotiations with the strikers, aiming to convey to the President the severity of the situation and the urgent need for the government to address their demands. In addition, the Health Secretary is attempting to achieve dual objectives through this single approach," Dr. Bellana claimed.

"The current paramedical services are vulnerable to outsourcing, and it's crucial for the government not to overlook this issue. It's been argued that doctors have made sacrifices by reducing their overtime hours, leading to a significant increase in unpaid overtime over the last two years. Furthermore, there's concern over the disproportionate tax burden on doctors' salaries, with taxes amounting to nearly 25% to 30%, while other professions receive salary increases without similar tax implications. This has created a disparity in salaries among health sector staff, highlighting an imbalance that needs addressing," he said.

Under the pretext of special allowances, salaries cannot continually escalate. Instead, salary increments could be achieved by relaxing the imposed taxes on doctors' salaries. Consequently, the role of the Health Secretary as a mediator between the government and trade unions should be promptly reevaluated, as it risks being reduced to a symbolic gesture. There are concerns that he is attempting to please all parties, including the President, by portraying himself as skillfully managing the situation," Dr. Bellana added.
