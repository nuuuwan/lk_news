Sri Lanka could benefit from global trend towards EV use – IPS study

The latest publication of the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka (IPS), `Trade Wars in Electric Vehicle Supply Chains: A Win for Sri Lanka’s Graphite Industry?” indicates that Sri Lanka is poised to benefit from the global trend towards electric vehicles (EVs). Sri Lanka stands to gain by leveraging its top-quality vein graphite, crucial for EV battery manufacturing, the publication says.

Sri Lanka, renowned for its high-quality vein graphite, is poised to benefit from the increasing demand for “non-China origin” graphite, driven by the global push towards electro mobility and the US Green Industrial Policy.

The IPS publication brought out by IPS researchers, Dr Asanka Wijesinghe, Malisha Weerasinghe and Chaya Dissanayake, explores the potential for Sri Lanka to join the supply chain for Electric Vehicle (EV) battery manufacturing.

Speaking at a seminar recently at the IPS, Colombo 7, IPS Research Fellow, Dr. Asanka Wijesinghe said that Sri Lanka’s commitment to sustainability and quality standards places it strategically in the non-China graphite export market, boosted by US industrial policies favouring domestic assembly and non-China sources.

Wijesinghe said that their new study highlights Sri Lanka’s opportunity to become part of the EV battery supply chain.

The study suggests that Sri Lanka could focus on upstream activities, including exporting battery-grade graphite and anodes, and strengthen Research & Development to enhance its strategic position in the non-China graphite export sector, thus attracting investment and ensuring sustainability.

Responding to The Island Financial Review on the possibility of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US, Wijesinghe believes that a comprehensive FTA may be challenging but a limited one, in the style of the Japan-US Mineral Free Trade Agreement, will be beneficial to Sri Lanka.

“Sri Lanka will have to navigate the complex geopolitical landscape in finalizing such an agreement. On the upside, such an agreement helps value addition to Sri Lanka’s graphite within the country and via export to the US under the subsidy program proposed by the US, he added.

Dr. Wijesinghe also said that US’s strategic move to adopt a proactive green industrial policy, driven by the imperative to achieve net-zero emissions and national security concerns, presents fresh opportunities for graphite producers outside China. The recently enforced Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) plays a pivotal role in reshaping the global EV battery supply value chain by excluding China and promoting domestic assembly and manufacturing of EV components.

Key findings from the IPS study reveal that as a result of these developments, the demand for graphite, a critical component of Lithium Ion Batteries (LIBs), is set to surge. “Non-China” graphite exporters, including Madagascar, Mozambique and particularly Sri Lanka, are positioned to benefit from the re-alignment of the supply chain.

The study also focuses that the Partial Equilibrium modeling results indicate that Sri Lanka holds a strategic advantage in the emerging market. Sri Lanka’s vein graphite, known for its purity, flawless crystal structure, and strong electrical conductivity, stands out as an ideal choice for the growing global demand.

Wijesinghe also stressed that despite facing challenges in terms of cost competitiveness, Sri Lanka’s focus on sustainable practices, minimal environmental impact, and compliance with acceptable labour standards positions it as a key player in the evolving landscape of “non-China” graphite exports.

“Additionally, Sri Lanka possesses a comparative advantage in graphite production and benefits from an established mining sector with an existing consumer base. Increased demand will party help Sri Lanka by increasing the world market price of graphite in the future. However, the productivity of the mining sector needs to be increased to lower the unit cost, to benefit from the emerging global opportunities,” he added.
