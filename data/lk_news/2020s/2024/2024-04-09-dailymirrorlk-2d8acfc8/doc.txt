Ranil likely to contest presidential election under new symbol: Presidential advisor

Colombo, April 9 (Daily Mirror) - Incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe is likely to contest the Presidential election under an entirely new symbol other than the elephant or flower bud, Senior Presidential Advisor and UNP senior Ashu Marasinghe said.

Professor Marasinghe told journalists that President Wickrmesinghe will represent a number of parties as a national candidate.

“People such as Minister Prasanna Ranatunga has said many including himself have an issue supporting Mr. Wickremeisnghe if he contests the Presidential election under the elephant symbol. Likewise, we in the UNP too have an issue with him contesting under the pohotuwa. Therefore Mr. Wickremeisnghe is expected to contest under a new symbol,” he said.

He said more than 80 percent of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) will be supporting Mr. Wickremesinghe at the next Presidential election.

“We welcome the proposal made by SJB MP Talatha Athukorala that both the SJB and the UNP should unite. We expect others in the SJB to support Mr. Wickremeisnghe even if SJB leader Sajith Premadasa decides against such a move,” he said.

Also he said it is not possible to hold both the Presidential election and the general election on the same day according to the Constitution.

Further, he claimed that Sri Lanka’s economy has begun to recover with foreign reserves growing up to USD 5 billion, while the tourism sector has experienced an unexpected gain during this year.
