General amnesty declared for tri-forces absentees

The Ministry of Defence has declared a general amnesty for the tri-forces absentees, enabling them to receive an official discharge from their respective services.

General amnesty will be in force for a period of one month, from 20 April to 20 May.

Accordingly, the tri-forces personnel who have been absent without leave (AWOL) before 02 April 2024 will be allowed to receive their discharge from military service during this period.

Additionally, any financial obligations or amounts due are required to be settled prior to their discharge.

Meanwhile, the absentees who are currently living overseas will also be eligible to receive a legal discharge from the military service without reporting to their respective regiments, subject to the following requirements:

• Those seeking to be discharged should have no pending disciplinary actions taken against them apart from that of being AWOL.

• Should have clearance from the Department of Immigration and Emigration confirming their travel abroad was done with legal documents and not on forged documents or by illegal means.

• It should be noted that this amnesty does not apply to those who had gone AWOL and failed to return to the country after attending foreign courses funded by the government or courses offered to Tri Forces by foreign institutes, and those who had proceeded on diplomatic missions or any other requirements.
