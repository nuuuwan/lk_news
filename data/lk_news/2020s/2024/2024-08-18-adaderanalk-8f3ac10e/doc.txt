Grama Niladhari Officers pause trade union action until prez poll ends

The Grama Niladhari Officers’ Alliance says that it will temporarily suspend its ongoing trade union action, effective from midnight today (Aug 18).

The decision comes as their trade union aims to ensure the maximum contribution of its members in the upcoming Presidential Election, recognizing the vital role that Grama Niladhari officers play as election officers, the co-chairman of the alliance Nandana Ranasinghe said.

The Grama Niladhari Officers’ unions launched trade union action on May 04, 2024, demanding adjustments to the Grama Niladhari service constitutions and allowance increments to better align with the current economic realities.

Later, the alliance observed a ‘Black Protest Week’ from August 12 to 18. Nandana Ranasinghe stated that they will also conclude this trade union action at midnight today.

Additionally, the work-to-rule campaign, which began on May 17, will be officially brought to an end tonight, according to Mr Ranasinghe.

The Grama Niladhari Officers’ Alliance emphasized that this suspension of trade union action is temporary, and their demands for reforms remain a priority and that the association has decided to temporarily cease its trade union actions in order to assist in carrying out a smooth electoral process.
