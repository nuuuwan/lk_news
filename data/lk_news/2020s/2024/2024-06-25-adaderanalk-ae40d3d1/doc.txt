Injunction against Minister Wijeyadasa extended further

The Colombo District Court has further extended the interim order issued preventing Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from functioning as Chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).

This order was issued when a plaint filed by the Treasurer of SLFP, State Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna was taken up before the court today (25).

Meanwhile, the Colombo District Court granted time for the respondents to file objections in this regard.

Subsequently, the case was ordered to be recalled on July 09, and the injunction will remain in effect until that date.
