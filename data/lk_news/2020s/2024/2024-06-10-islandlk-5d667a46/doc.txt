MCCI delivers fully renovated filling station to Sinopec

The entire renovation of a Sinopec filling station in Sri Lanka, fully funded by Sinopec Overseas, was completed by MCC International Incorporation Ltd. (MCCI) on June 4.

The agreement for the full renovation of Sinopec’s Ariyadasa Filling Station in Colombo was signed on April 22, 2024. It was MCCI’s first construction project in the petrochemical industry Sri Lanka, involving industrial risks, a tight schedule, and many challenges.

MCCI made arrangements with various departments working together seamlessly, organising a strong team to quickly commence construction. The project officially started on May 11.

With the strong support and assistance of Sinopec’s specialists, MCCI team has overcome adverse effects such as shipping delays and construction during the rainy season, completing the safety hazard modifications in seven days and the entire renovation was completed in six days, achieving the goal of “MCC Speed, Sinopec Quality”.

The MCCI team received recognition and praise from Sinopec officials. The successful handover of the first station has accumulated experience and laid a solid foundation for the continued implementation of subsequent filling station projects.

MCCI said they would take it as an opportunity to continue to uphold the corporate spirit of “Never delaying and Never slacking” and further develop their cooperation with Sinopec.
