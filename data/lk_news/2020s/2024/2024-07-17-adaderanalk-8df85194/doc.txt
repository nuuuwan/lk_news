Fairly heavy showers and strong winds expected in parts of the country

The Department of Meteorology says the prevailing windy conditions over the island are expected to continue further, due to the active South West Monsoonal condition.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern and North-western provinces and in Kandy and Nuwara-Eliya districts.

Fairly heavy showers about 50 mm are likely at some places in Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces and in Kandy and Nuwara-Eliya districts, it said.

Strong winds of about 50-60kmph can be expected at times over Western slopes of the central hills and in Northern, North-central and North-western provinces and in Trincomalee, Monaragala and Hambantota districts. Fairly strong winds about 30-40kmph can be expected at times elsewhere of the island.
