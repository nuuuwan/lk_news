Three minor staff members arrested over assault incident at Karapitiya Hospital granted bail

The three minor staff members of the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital who were arrested and remanded in connection with a complaint by the hospital’s senior oncologist alleging assault, have been granted bail.

The relevant order was issued by the Galle Magistrate’s Court on Monday (22 Jan.), upon consideration of a motion filed by the accused seeking bail.

The three minor staff, including a female, were arrested on 21 January, over an alleged assault incident based on a complaint filed by the senior oncologist of the hospital, Dr. Krishantha Perera.

Earlier today, Dr. Krishantha Perera, who was arrested and remanded for allegedly assaulting a female junior staff member, was also granted bail.

61-year-old Dr. Krishantha Perera was granted bail on orders of the Galle Magistrate’s on two personal bonds of Rs. 1 million each.

The relevant order was issued by Galle Magistrate Isuru Neththikumara.

The senior oncologist in question, Dr. Krishantha Perera, 61, was arrested on 18 January for purportedly assaulting a female junior staff member during a contentious situation that had ensued the previous morning.

He was accused of assaulting the said staff member during a heated argument between him and the other junior staffers after he slammed them for disrupting hospital services by going on a token strike the day before.

The hospital’s authorities had brought the situation under control, however, a female junior staff member got herself admitted to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, claiming an assault by the senior oncologist who was subsequently arrested and remanded until January 22 on the orders of the Galle Magistrate.
