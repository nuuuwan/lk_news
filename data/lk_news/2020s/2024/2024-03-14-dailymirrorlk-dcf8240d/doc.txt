Hope to import vehicles gradually from next year: President

Colombo, March 14 (Daily Mirror) - President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that he hopes to gradually relax the import of private vehicles starting from next year.

The President made these remarks while attending a gathering organized by the United Youth Union, titled "Future of the Youth," held yesterday (12) at Taprobane Entertainment.

"I cannot see vehicle imports happening this year, but we would like to do it gradually starting next year," he said.

The President said that he knows there is a problem in the existing car market, but under the balance of payments, the government has allowed the import of everything other than vehicles.

"If the import of cars are allowed, then there is a possibility of the country going backwards, but we hope to import vehicles in a systematic, step-by-step manner. We will import essential types of vehicles as the first step," he said.

This year, the government allowed buses to be imported to transport tourists, he said.

While raising questions, the youth told the President that the current prices in the used car market has doubled and tripled and that there is no proper price control.
