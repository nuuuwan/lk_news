Train services from Colombo Fort disrupted

The Railway Department says that train services from Colombo Fort have been temporarily disrupted due to workers at the Dematagoda Yard withdrawing from duties.

The department says that employees at the Dematagoda Yard have stopped work on claims that proper action is not being taken to find a fellow employee who has gone missing.

Accordingly, this is expected to likely result in some train cancellations and delays in relevant services from the Colombo Fort railway station.

Deputy General Manager (Operations) of the Railway Department, Mr. N.J. Idipolage said that due to this, the Podi Menike and Badulla Odyssey trains, which were scheduled to depart from Colombo Fort to Badulla this morning, have not been able to operate so far.

He also mentioned that several train journeys will likely have to be canceled owing to the current situation.
