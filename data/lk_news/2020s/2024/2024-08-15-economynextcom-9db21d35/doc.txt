Sri Lanka welcomes Canada proscription of LTTE, World Tamil Movement

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s government has welcomed Canada’s decision to retain the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) along with the World Tamil Movement (WTM) as terrorist entities.

Canada first listed the LTTE as a terrorist entity under the Criminal Code in April 2006. It is a statutory requirement to undertake a review every five years. The latest review process concluded in June 2024.

According to the recent review, Canada maintains that the remnants of the LTTE have an international fundraising and procurement network that still exists, Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.

“The review of the WTM notes that the group continues to play a facilitating role in the LTTE’s terrorist activities by fundraising on their behalf. This decision taken following a rigorous review process, reaffirms the continued threat posed by these organizations.”

The LTTE was also recently proscribed in India and the European Union. An application made for the de-proscription of the LTTE in the UK, this year, was dismissed. (Colombo/Aug15/2024)
