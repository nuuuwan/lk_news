Bourse in erratic mode as negative investor sentiment takes hold

The stock market yesterday plunged initially but subsequently recovered somewhat though investor sentiment remained wary amid low turnover. However, active participation of bargaining hunters was a notable feature of later trading, market analysts said.

Amid those developments both indices moved up. The All Share Price Index went up by 42 points while S and P SL20 rose by 20.7 points. Turnover over stood at Rs 582 million sans any crossings.

During the day 24.3 million share volumes changed hands in 7199 transactions.
