Gotabaya lacked basic management skills: Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera

Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa did not have the management skills of even a small child, Chief Sanganayaka of the Western Province and chief incumbent of the Abhayarama, Most Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera said.

He said this while attending the launch of the book titled Echo of People's Struggle (Aragalaye Donkaraya) yesterday.

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena were present on this occasion.

"Mahinda Rajapaksa did not receive such a response from the people and he still has the respect of the people," he said.

Ven. Ananda Thera further said that the Maha Sangha, including him, worked hard with huge dedication to make Gotabaya Rajapaksa the President. However, the Rajapaksas' respect was destroyed due to Gotabaya's administrative incompetence.
