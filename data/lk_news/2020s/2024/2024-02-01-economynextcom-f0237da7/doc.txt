Sri Lanka stocks close up, 1bn turnover

ECONOMYNEXT – The Colombo Stock Exchange closed up on Thursday, data on its site showed.

The All Share Price Index was up 0. 63 percent, or 64.57 points, at 10,375.

The S&P SL20 index was up 1.27 percent, or 36.82 points, at 2,933.

Turnover was at 1.1 billion. Trading in LB Finance Plc contributed (216mn) of this, and the share closed down at 61.00.

Nations Trust Bank Plc also saw fairly high volumes being traded (203mn) and the share closed up at 101.25.

The banks industry group as a whole contributed the most to the day’s turnover (420mn), followed by the diversified financials sector (261). The two sectors have seen some selling pressure in the last month ahead of the country’s external debt restructuring completion.

But with the decline in bond yield rates, investor interest renewed in the sectors with several companies contributing positively to the ASPI in the day; Sampath Bank Plc closed up at 70.10, Commercial Bank of Ceylon Plc closed up at 88.10, DFCC Bank Plc closed up at 75.00, Central Finance Company Plc closed up at 102.25, and Vallibel One Plc closed up at 37.30.

The net foreign outflow since the beginning of this year continued, however, with today registering an outflow of 164 million. (Colombo/Feb1/2024).
