SJB to take disciplinary action against SF?

Taking an offensive stance against Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, Leader of the Opposition and Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leader Sajith Premadasa said he will not hesitate to take displinary action against those who criticise decisions taken by him and his party.

This offensive remark by Premadasa came just a few days after MP Fonseka criticised the decision made by Premadasa to appoint former Army Commander, General (Retired) Daya Ratnayake as Senior Advisor to the SJB.

"No one should call me and tell me whom I should give party membership to. I will ignore such people who try to advice me. I will not hesitate to take bold decisions to take disciplinary action against those who criticize the party," Sajith Premadasa told a gathering in Galle over the weekend.

"It is the duty of SJB members to safeguard the party and see that it emerges victorious at future elections. Those who cannot carry out that duty should get out," he added.

"Some people try to draw a similarity between my father and me. However, I only accept my father's development model. Therefore, there are differences between me and my father," he also said.
