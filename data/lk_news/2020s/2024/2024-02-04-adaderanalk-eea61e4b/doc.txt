Imperative to obtain insights from past mistakes and avoid repetition – President

In his Independence Day message, President Ranil Wickremesinghe invited all Sri Lankans, here and abroad, to contribute their utmost energy to the noble mission of rebuilding the nation.

He said that achievements were realized progressively, owing to the steadfast support of the country’s citizens who endured hardships in keeping with a comprehensive, long-term national rebuilding programme.

“Throughout this journey, challenges will gradually dissipate, life’s burdens will lighten, the economy will fortify and Mother Sri Lanka will undergo a renaissance,” he said.

The President said that upon gaining independence in 1948, global expectations envisioned Sri Lanka evolving into a developed nation in the East, given its favourable background. “Regrettably, we deviated from this course and found ourselves grappling with economic difficulties,” he said.

He said it is imperative that we obtain insights from past mistakes and avoid their repetition. “With the current growth trajectory acknowledged globally, let us collectively resolve on this Independence Day to persist on this path and reinstate prosperity.”

As we commemorated the 75th year of our nation’s independence, we encountered the indignity of being labeled a financially bankrupt country. Nevertheless, upon the advent of the 76th Independence Day, we have effectively navigated through these challenges, steering the economy toward stability despite numerous impediments and challenges.

Achievements were realized progressively, owing to the steadfast support of our citizens who endured hardships in keeping with a comprehensive, long-term national rebuilding programme. Throughout this journey, challenges will gradually dissipate, life’s burdens will lighten, the economy will fortify and Mother Sri Lanka will undergo a renaissance.
