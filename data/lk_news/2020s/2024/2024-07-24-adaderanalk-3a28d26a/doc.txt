Decision on petitions challenging IGP’s appointment expected today

The fundamental rights (FR) petitions filed challenging the appointment of Deshabandu Tennakoon as the Inspector General of Police (IGP) are slated to be taken up for consideration once again today (24).

The Supreme Court on July 18 concluded considering the FR petitions filed challenging the appointment of Tennakoon as the IGP.

Accordingly, the court had then announced that the decision as to whether or not the petitions will be taken up for hearing will be delivered today (24).

The court is also expected to announce today as to whether an interim order will be issued preventing Deshabandu Tennakoon from functioning as the IGP.

A three-member bench had previously taken up for consideration the eight petitions put forward by several parties including the Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, Prof. Savitri Gunasekara, former MP Hirunika Premachandra and several others.

The petitioners allege that Tennakoon had neglected his duties during his tenure as the Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police (SDIG) of the Western Province when the 2019 Easter attacks happened, and when a pre-mediated attack was launched on the ‘GotaGoGama’ protest site at the Galle Face Green where several protesters were brutally assaulted.
