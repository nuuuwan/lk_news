David Pieris Motor Company Ltd. (DPMC), the largest automotive company in Sri Lanka, recently celebrated 30 years of revolutionising not only the local automotive industry but also the transportation industry.

DPMC has become a driving force of innovation in Sri Lanka’s automotive industry, giving transportation solutions that provide affordability, economy, and convenience, impacting the lives of almost every citizen in Sri Lanka.

This milestone was celebrated with the David Pieris Group Founder and President David Pieris and all the employees of the Group at a get together held at Pearl Bay, Bandaragama. The highlight of the event was Pieris addressing over 1,600 employees, motivating them to be resilient, overcome challenges and stride through the next three decades. In addition, 15 founder employees who completed their 30 years’ service were felicitated.

“We are truly privileged to have touched the lives of millions of Sri Lankans through our products, services and efforts to uplift the lives of communities in which we live and work,” said Group Chairman and Managing Director Rohana Dissanayake. “Today, we are proud to be the largest automotive company with one in three vehicles on our roads being Bajaj and unsurpassed island-wide customer touch points. By providing affordable mobility through economical vehicles, we paved the way for the less privileged to own their very first family vehicle. The ecosystem built around these vehicles has created significant employment, giving rise and impetus to local industries,” Dissanayake added.

DPMC’s roots date back to 1985 when Richard Pieris Motor Company was incorporated. After a management buyout in January 1994, the name was changed to David Pieris Motor Company and operation commenced with just 195 employees. Today the single entity company has grown to be a leading diversified conglomerate comprising of 22 companies with business interests in Automotive, Financial Services, Real Estate and Investment Property Development, Logistics and Warehouse Operations, Shipping and Marine Services, Information Communication Technologies, Racing and Leisure, Solar and Distribution of Electronic and Electric Consumer Durables.

Being the sole distributor in Sri Lanka, DPMC transformed Bajaj into more than just a brand, making it a household name and a market leader for motorcycles and three-wheelers with over three million vehicles sold. Over the years, the company has grown considerably, marking many firsts and milestones including introducing Europe’s No. 1 bike, KTM, Sri Lanka’s first automated conveyorised, ISO-certified vehicle manufacturing and assembly facility with an output of 1,000 vehicles every day. More recently they launched the first motorcycle under the locally value-added program and registered Sri Lanka’s first converted electric three-wheeler. The company’s success can be attributed to their commitment to their customers through island wide accessibility and a strong emphasis on after sales care through seven regional offices and over 1,700 connected sales, service and spare part dealers.

DPMC has been a catalyst in driving social and economic growth and empowering millions of lives by enabling empowerment, self-employment, and entrepreneurship. Instrumental in launching Sri Lanka’s very first women technical training program, the company continues to support the communities in which it operates through CSR initiatives in the areas such as education, environment, health, water and sanitation, and sports.
