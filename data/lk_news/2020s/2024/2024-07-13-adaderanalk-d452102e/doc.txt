EU backs promoting Ceylon cinnamon exports to higher-value markets

The European Union (EU) is backing Sri Lanka’s initiative of the newly established Department of Cinnamon Development through the Export Agriculture in Sri Lanka project, the EU Delegation to Sri Lanka and Maldives said in a statement.

The statement highlighted that the EU will bring in the expertise of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to promote Ceylon cinnamon exports to higher-value markets by focusing on quality improvement efforts.

The project supports the implementation and enforcement of quality, builds the capacity of field officers and farmer organisations and provides technology, it added.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe recently inaugurated the newly established Department of Cinnamon Development, dedicated to the cultivation and enhancement of cinnamon production. This department aims to boost cinnamon output, leveraging advanced techniques and support systems to elevate the industry.

During the ceremony, selected cinnamon entrepreneurs were awarded the Geographical Indications (GI) certificates. These distinctions recognize the highest standards in cinnamon cultivation and production, setting a benchmark for quality and excellence in the industry, the EU delegation’s statement added.
