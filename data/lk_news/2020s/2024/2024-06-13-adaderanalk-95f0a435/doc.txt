Train services on Coastal Line limited to single track

The train operations on the Coastal Line have been further limited to a single track, following the derailment of a train at Panadura Railway Station this morning (13).

A slow train plying from Panadura to Maradana derailed near the Panadura railway station, disrupting services on the coastal line.

Furthermore, one of the compartments of the derailed train had collided with a nearby railway signal board, causing a complete breakdown of the railway signaling system in the area.

Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Sri Lanka Railways stated that it will take a considerable amount of time to restore the railway line for regular train operations.

However, the Department of Railways announced that one of the two railway tracks on the coastal line has now been re-opened for train operations.

The train delays will continue further on the coastal line, according to theÂ  department.
