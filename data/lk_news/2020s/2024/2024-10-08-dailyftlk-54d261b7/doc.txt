CWC Vice President Barath resigns

Says will continue to work on “sustainable future” of the country

The Ceylon Workers’ Congress (CWC) Vice President Barath Arullsamy, who had been representing the Kandy district, has tendered his resignation via an official letter sent to the party’s general secretary.

In his letter, Barath had cited his disagreement with the CWC’s alignment with representatives who have been accused of harming the country for their own benefit during a time of national crisis. “This view is contrary to the opinions of the constituents in my constituency whom I have served sincerely for the past five years.”

Barath had served as the Assistant Secretary and been a crucial figure in developing the international relations of the organisation. He contested in the 2020 General Election and obtained 24,000 preferential votes for the first time as a young candidate of the CWC.

Barath also chaired the Plantation Human Development Trust during the economic crisis, which was a key institution that helped the humanitarian aid among the plantation, serving seven regions.
