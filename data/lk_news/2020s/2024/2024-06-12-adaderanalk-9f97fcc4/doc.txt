New Immigration Bill to be presented to Parliament

The Cabinet of Ministers has granted approval to publish the new draft Immigration Bill in the Government Gazette and to present it thereafter in Parliament for approval.

The Immigration Act No. 20 of 1948 has been amended on several occasions. However, considering the rapid changes taking place in the field covered by the Act, the rapid development of technology as well as international trends, the Cabinet of Ministers had given approval on February 15, 2021 to introduce a new Act for the same.

The clearance of the Attorney General has been received for the draft Bill prepared by the Legal Draftsman accordingly, the Cabinet Spokesman Minister Bandula Gunawardena said.

Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles to publish the said draft Bill in the Government Gazette and present the same thereafter in Parliament for approval, was approved by the Cabinet, he said.
