Birthday bash …with a difference

The General Manager of the Galadari Hotel, Sampath Siriwardena, celebrated his 70th birthday, in grand style.

The celebrations took place on Saturday, January 13th, 2024, at the Grand Ballroom of the Galadari Hotel, amidst a gathering that included several well-known personalities.

What made this birthday bash different is the excitement that unfolded, from, 7.30 pm till around 12 midnight, and, I believe, Sampath’s charming wife Surakshi (in a gorgeous sari) played a vital role in putting together this unforgettable birthday party.

Mignonne and Suraj, who are very much a part of the Galadari entertainment scene, along with guest performer Roger Menezes (from Australia), kept the crowd entertained, with the kind of music ideally suited for such an occasion.

The big surprise came by way of former Jetliners Felix Fernando, Anton Gunawijeya and Indra Raj.

They all live abroad and, I was told, they made a special trip to Colombo, to surprise the birthday boy!

In fact, they surprised everyone when they got on stage and zoomed into action…creating the sounds that made The Jetliners famous.

None of them have lost that magic touch and the music that emanated from the stage was wonderful, exciting. It was simply awesome.

Indra Raj was brilliant and reminded me of The Shadows with Hank Marvin where their music was totally different from the groups that were around, at that point in time.

When the cake was wheeled in, Felix, Anton and Indra Raj, along with Suren Ediriweera, on drums, and Suraj, on guitar, did their instrumental version of the ‘Happy Birthday’ song, and then the crowd joined in, creating wonderful memories.

The music provided for those to gyrate on the floor was variety plus, plus – rock ‘n’ roll, the twist, etc., and the enthusiastic crowd went into action…with glee!

The baila was left for the final session, with Sohan Weerasinghe and Rukshan Perera coming into the spotlight.

Damian Wikkramatillake also made it a happening scene, on stage, with his dynamic vocals, and presentation.

Not to be outdone, the birthday boy, too, got on stage and did impress everyone with a selection of songs that brought out his singing capabilities.

When it was all over, I’m doubly sure those present would have left for home with memories of a spectacular birthday party.
