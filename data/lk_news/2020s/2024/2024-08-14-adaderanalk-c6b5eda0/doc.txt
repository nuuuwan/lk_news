Fairly heavy showers, strong winds expected in parts of the island

The Meteorology Department says showers or thundershowers will occur at times in Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces and in Galle and Matara districts.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places elsewhere of the island during the evening or night.

Fairly heavy showers above 50 mm are likely at some places, it said.

Fairly strong winds of about 30-40 kmph can be expected at times over the Western slopes of the central hills and in the North-western province and in Ampara, Monaragala and Hambantota districts.

The general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
