Retired Army Major arrested for swindling money promising jobs with Russian army

The Criminal Investigations Department (CID) has arrested a retired Major of the Sri Lanka Army and another person for fraudulently obtaining money from individuals on the promise of sending them for employment in the Russian army, police said.

However, on April 01, the Ministry of Defence announced that all members of Sri Lankan tri-forces have been informed not to join Russian or Ukrainian forces by any illegal means.

The Ministry of Defense also mentioned that against a background where there is no agreement between the Sri Lankan army and the Russian army to send Sri Lankan military members to serve in Russia, such incidents will damage the reputation of the country.

Meanwhile in December 2023, it was reported that three Sri Lankan mercenaries were killed in Russian attack while serving in Ukrainian military.

Nevertheless, a report published on Al Jazeera news service which quoted several Sri Lankans living in Russia, highlighted that hundreds of Sri Lankans are now serving with the Russian military in Ukraine, most lured into combat by Russia’s offer of salaries up to $3,000 a month and the prospect of Russian citizenship.

“Many more – mostly retired Sri Lankan soldiers – are also desperately trying to join the Russian army, willing to risk death at the hands of Ukrainian forces in exchange for Moscow’s money amid dire poverty at home in Sri Lanka”, it added.
