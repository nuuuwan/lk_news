‘Harak Kata’ further remanded over failed escape bid

Notorious underworld figure Nadun Chithaka Wickremeratne, alias ‘Harak Kata’, has been further remanded until 26 April over his failed escape attempt from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).

The relevant order was issued by the Colombo High Court Judge Damith Thotawatte.

Accordingly, ‘Harak Kata’ will be detained at the old prison complex in Tangalle, which currently operates as a detention centre.

Earlier today (11 March), ‘Harak Kata’ was produced before the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court, after which he was produced before the Colombo High Court following a request made by the CID.

On 10 September 2023, ‘Harak Kata’, who was being interrogated by eight CID officers, had reportedly laced the officers’ teas with poison during his questioning, with the help of a Police Constable.

During the questioning, “Harak Kata” had allegedly requested to go to the washroom and was escorted out of the interrogation room with his accomplice – the police constable, and another sub-inspector attached to the Police Special Task Force (STF), assigned for the suspect’s protection.

Although his handcuffs were removed at that point, the underworld kingpin had then walked out of the washroom acting as if he was still cuffed and had then attempted to snatch the STF officer’s firearm leading to a scuffle.

A group of other CID officers were quick to arrive at the scene, upon hearing the commotion and managed to detain “Harak Kata” in their custody.
