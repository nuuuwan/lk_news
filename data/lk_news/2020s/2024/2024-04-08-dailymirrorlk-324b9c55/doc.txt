Probe launched into studentsâ€™ use of STF-like uniforms at school event

Colombo, April 8 (Daily Mirror) - The Special Investigation Unit of the Police Headquarters has launched an investigation into students being dressed in uniforms resembling the jungle camouflage uniforms used by the Police Special Task Force (STF) during a sports event at a leading school in Gampaha.

Police said the probe was launched following orders from the Inspector General of Police due to concerns that police officers responsible for overseeing the police cadets were aware of the incident but took no preventive action.

In addition, the investigation will address the lack of proper permission for the uniforms.

Police said that disciplinary action will be taken against any officers found to have acted improperly.

The uniforms worn by the students have been seized by the Gampaha headquarters police while the tailor responsible for making these uniforms has also been arrested by the Police Special Task Force for possessing and sewing jungle attire belonging to the STF without proper authorization.

The suspect has been handed over to the Anuradhapura Police for further proceedings.
