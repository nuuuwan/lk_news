Lalkantha’s remark triggers showdown in Parliament

Colombo, May 8 (Daily Mirror) - The remark made by National People's Power (NPP) strongman K. D. Lalkantha at the recent May Day rally that a future NPP government will decentralize judicial powers to its cadres at village level, triggered a flare up in Parliament with both the ruling party and Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) launching a verbal attack on MP Harini Amarasuriya.

The flare up occurred when State Minister Shehan Semasinghe said Lalkantha had pledged to vest judicial power with his party cadres at the village level.

An audio clip which comprises Lalkantha’s speech was played by SJB MP Harshana Rajakaruna.

Ms. Amarasuriya said Lalkantha never mentioned that judicial powers will be devolved to NPP cadres in the village level. “Mr. Lalkantha only ensured access to justice to all people,” she said.

Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe who responded recalled how one JVP member Sumanasena who intervened and resolved land disputes in 1989. “ JVP cadres took law into their hands during that time.

MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage who responded said Lalkantha is going to be the minister of justice in a NPP led government in the future. “Lalkantha has shown how he is going to act in a future NPP government,” he said.

“JVPers killed those who voted in the 1988 presidential election,” he also recalled.

Ms. Amarasuriya said there is no use in talking of the 1989 insurrection now.

“Ms. Amarasuriya may be able to forget that past, we cannot,” Aluthgamage replied.\
