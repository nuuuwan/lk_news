Former Speaker and National Movement for Social Justice Chairperson Karu Jayasuriya

Former Speaker and National Movement for Social Justice Chairperson Karu Jayasuriya voiced his profound regret yesterday over the Police’s handling of the porridge distribution event in Sampur commemorating the victims of the war and enforced disappearances.

In a statement, Jayasuriya said the society must empathetically acknowledge the anguish of those who have lost loved ones to death or disappearance. “It is our collective responsibility to prevent such tragedies from plunging our country into another dark era,” he said.

“Therefore, it is imperative for the entire society, including Government authorities, to act in these situations with the best interests of the country at heart. Failure to do so could potentially lead our nation into a dark age,” remarked the former speaker.

Jayasuriya expressed deep shock and sorrow over the loss and disappearance of individuals in past unfortunate incidents in the country. The former Speaker called on all parties to commit to ensuring justice for the victims and to work towards preventing similar tragedies in the future.
