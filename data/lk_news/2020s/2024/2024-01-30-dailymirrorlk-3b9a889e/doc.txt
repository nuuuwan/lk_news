Minimum speed limit on expressways soon: Bandula

Colombo, Jan. 30 (Daily Mirror)- Steps are being taken to impose a minimum speed limit on expressways as accidents are caused due to slow-moving vehicles, Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardana said today.

He told the weekly Cabinet briefing that even though the maximum speed limit is imposed as 100 kmph, no minimum speed has been imposed yet.

He said most accidents are caused when overtaking slow moving vehicles and it is important to set a minimum speed limit to prevent such accidents.

The Minister said a discussion was held with experts in the field and relevant institutions such as the police regarding the accidents on expressways and that new rules and regulations will be published in a gazette notification within two weeks.
