NPP accepts Daily Mirror invitation for political debate, Sajith’s confirmation awaited

The National People's Power (NPP) yesterday accepted the official invitation for the political debate to be held by the Daily Mirror and Lankadeepa, with the three main presidential candidates while the Samagi Jana Balawegaya leader Sajith Premadasa is yet to confirm his participation.

The Daily Mirror invitation was accepted by NPP General Secretary Tilvin Silva, who said that NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake is ready for the debate and will attend.

The Daily Mirror handed over the official invitation to the Opposition leader's office in Colombo and the team is still to receive his confirmation of participation. However by last evening, Premadasa’s office confirmed that Sajith Premadasa had received the invitation letter and had directed it to MP Nalin Bandara who is handling the affairs regarding the debates.

The official invitation to President Ranil Wickremesinghe will be handed over soon.

The Daily Mirror and Lankadeepa extended an invitation on April 8 to the three main Presidential candidates - Ranil Wickremesinghe, Anura Kumara Dissanayake and Sajith Premadasa for a LIVE political debate on their economic and political policies and their pledges in moving the country forward if they win the upcoming Presidential election scheduled to be held in October.

The interview will be aired LIVE on the Daily Mirror, Lankadeepa, and Tamil Mirror and Sunday Times digital platforms.

A date and time to host the debate will be announced in the due course once all three candidates accepted the invitations.
