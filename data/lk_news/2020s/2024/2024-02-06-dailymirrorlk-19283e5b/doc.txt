Health strike to resume if decent solution remains elusive

Colombo, Feb 6 (Daily Mirror) - The trade unions representing the health sector will not hesitate to resume the suspended strike tomorrow (06) if the scheduled meeting with the Finance Ministry officials did not provide a satisfactory solution.

According to Ravi Kumudesh, President of the Joint Council for Professions of Supplementary Medicine, a crucial meeting has been scheduled today (06) at the Finance Ministry under the directive of the President where the grievances are to be taken into account.

“However, the strike will resume from tomorrow if a satisfactory resolution remains elusive,” he stressed.

The move comes following a countrywide strike initiated by 72 trade unions in the health sector commencing from February 01 against the prolonged dispute surrounding the Disturbance, Availability, and Transport (DAT) allowance.

The healthcare services across the country were paralyzed owing to the strike action inconveniencing the patients.
