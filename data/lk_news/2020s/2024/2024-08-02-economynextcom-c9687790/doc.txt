Sri Lanka seeks details after getting OCC, IMF views on ISB restructure plan

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has sought further details after getting an initial assessment by the International Monetary Fund and the Official Creditor Committee on a restructure plan struck with sovereign bond holders, the Finance Ministry said.

The IMF has to give a verdict on whether the debt plan is in line with a debt sustainability analysis and official creditors have to say whether it is fits the comparability of treatment.

The statement did not say what the initial assessments indicated.

“Once these have been received, it will be possible to engage further with bondholders on the basis of the information provided by these assessments and conclude the process,” the statement said.

The International Monetary Fund concluded a mission to Sri Lanka. (Colombo/Aug02/2024)
