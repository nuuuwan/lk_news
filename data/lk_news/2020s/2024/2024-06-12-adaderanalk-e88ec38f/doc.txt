Teenage school girl accidentally electrocuted to death

A 17-year-old school girl has reportedly been electrocuted to death while attempting to plug in an electric sewing machine to a power socket in an unsafe manner.

The deceased is a student of Mahamaya Balika Vidyalaya, Nugegoda.

The 17-year-old girl had attempted to use the sewing machine, which was inoperable, at home while her grandmother was resting in another room due to an illness.

It is said that the student had attempted to connect the plug connected to the motor and wire of the sewing machine to a wall switch socket in the room but was unsuccessful.

She was then electrocuted while attempting to modify the plug by cutting it and then inserting the wires directly into the socket.

After hearing the girlâ€™s screams, a neighbour had rushed to help and proceeded to hospitalise the girl. However, she was pronounced dead on admission to the Piliyandala District Hospital.

Piliyandala Police also stated that the deceased girl had lost her father only last year while he was employed at a hotel in Malaysia, while her mother had recently left for employment in Saudi Arabia.
