NDB Bank brings joy and learning to Royal College on World Children’s Day

In celebration of World Children’s Day 2024, NDB Bank hosted a special event at Royal College, Colombo, offering a series of fun and educational activities for students. The day was filled with excitement, creativity, and learning, designed to engage children in meaningful experiences that inspire good habits, financial literacy, and creativity.

The day’s festivities catered to two age groups. For students in grades 1-3, the event featured an interactive magic show that captivated the young audience and a session by NDB Bank on cultivating good habits. For grades 4 and 5, the magic show continued to entertain, followed by a lively Q&A session that engaged students on essential life skills and habits.

A highlight of the event was the recognition of winners from the art competition that had been organised by the Bank’s curated Children’s Savings account, NDB Shilpa. The competition, which focused on the theme “Let’s Save Good Habits,” encouraged students to reflect on positive values through their artistic creations. Creativity, relevance, and presentation were the criteria for choosing winners; however, all participants were given tokens of appreciation, and the winners were honoured with special gifts and prizes.
