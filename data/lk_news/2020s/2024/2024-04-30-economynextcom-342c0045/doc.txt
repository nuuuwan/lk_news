Sri Lanka Freedom Party majority will back president in broad alliance: state minister

ECONOMYNEXT — A majority of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will join President Ranil Wickremesinghe in a broad alliance in support of his development agenda, State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya said.

Speaking to reporters, Balasuriya said members of the SLFP including Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva come on board the president’s ongoing development agenda.

“This is not a programme built on fairy tales. It president is following an agenda that is sustainable in the long term. I think development activities will happen rapidly this year. We can expedite development activities after debt restructuring has been completed,” said Balasuriya.

The SLFP is currently embroiled in an unprecedented crisis, with the party fractured into several factions.

However, at least one of the factions has planned a Labour Day rally for Wednesday May 01.

Former President and ex-SLFP chairman Maithripala Sirisena told the media that the party’s rally will be held at the Gampaha municipal council grounds.

“Over 90 percent of the organisers are on the right side of the party. Other factions can’t mobilise people and get the support of organisers. The Gampaha may rally is important to us. The others can’t do this. I will attend as an MP but not be part of any organising,” he said.

Media reports citing police spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa said 40 May Day events have been planned around the country.

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka’s main opposition the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has overtaken the leftist National People’s Power (NPP) in a voting intent poll for a future parliamentary election while SJB leader Sajith Premadasa has closed a gap with NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake for this year’s presidential election.
