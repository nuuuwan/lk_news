HNB empowering Sri Lanka’s agricultural sector

Consolidating its efforts to empower farmers and ensure the nation’s food security, Sri Lanka’s leading private sector bank, HNB PLC, launched a comprehensive support system under the HNB Leasing Govi Saviya campaign.

“We are thrilled to launch the ‘HNB Leasing Govi Saviya’ initiative alongside our partners, reaffirming our commitment to every Sri Lankan, from the individual farmer to the large corporations. With nearly half of our nation’s land dedicated to agriculture yet contributing only 6.5% to the GDP, it’s evident that there’s a vast opportunity for growth.

Many farmers rely on ancient practices with no access to modernization and financial resources. HNB Leasing Govi Saviya aims to bridge this gap and address any challenges they may face with targeted support backed by innovative financial solutions. Our collaboration with microfinance officers and leading agricultural companies is crucial as it allows us to understand and meet unique needs.

It allows us the opportunity to offer a comprehensive toolkit for enhancing productivity and ensuring food security. We understand that agriculture plays a pivotal role in our economy and the well-being of our people. This initiative marks a significant step towards establishing a sustainable and thriving agri sector,” HNB DGM – Wholesale Banking Group, Damith Pallewatte.
