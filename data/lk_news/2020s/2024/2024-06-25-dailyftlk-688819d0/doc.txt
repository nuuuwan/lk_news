The Boardroom introduces business made easy tools

Developer of Sri Lanka’s first Company Secretary App, Ananda Sirisena and Company (ASAC) recently announced a range of value additions and new features to “The Boardroom” app.

The pioneering app which enables companies to store, view and work with key documentation ensures a more streamlined approach to business management. The new additions include easy document sharing, notifications in one place, and password-free logins.

Ananda Sirisena & Company Chief Operating Officer Isura Sirisena said: “At The Boardroom, we believe that innovation should never be a bore. That’s why our development team is dedicated to keeping our customers engaged and excited for the next great feature. What we have in store for you with these new features will definitely add value to your business and make management much easier.”

Sharing documents has never been simpler with the “Sharing” function. Through the app, you can choose to share your key documents as a link or an attachment on to any messaging channel, including Apple’s AirDrop.

No one likes constant notifications, and the new “Notifications in One Place” feature ensures that you stay updated without the clutter. All notifications, past and present, are conveniently accessible under notification.

In a world where cyber-security is of utmost importance, the developers of The Boardroom app have also enhanced accessibility with a password-free login. For a seamless login experience, the app now sends a One Time Password (OTP) to your designated email for enhanced security measures.

The app also has a customer feedback portal that allows developers to keep moving forward with integrations that best suit the needs and wants of your business.

One of the latest and most exciting features introduced by the app is the creation of logos for your business. If you are a start-up or even an established business looking or a facelift, the creative team at The Boardroom is able to design a logo that suits the personality of your business. What’s best is that the logo creation comes at no cost at all!

CarMart Executive Director Yasendra Amerasinghe said: “The Boardroom app by Ananda Sirisena & Co. has revolutionised how I manage company documents. It provides quick and convenient access to essential files and allows me to request certified copies from anywhere, at any time, for multiple companies with ease. This app has significantly streamlined our company workflows, saving both time and effort. The ability to carry out almost all company secretarial work digitally, combined with their efficiency and quality of work sets Ananda Sirisena & Co apart from the rest.”

The app has also become a favourite among international clients who operate businesses in Sri Lanka, and find it extremely handy to have all their documents in one place.

Navon Group Founder and Chief Executive Officer Georgiana Mart said: “As a business owner The Boardroom app has become indispensable. Its user-friendly interface and robust document management system have significantly improved our organisational efficiency. I own four companies in Sri Lanka and my favourite part of the app is its excellent document management. Everything is so easy and at hand, which makes it vital in emergency situations. Payments are one click away. Same as requiring certified documents from our company secretary. If I ever face any issue, the responsive and fast customer support is always there to help. Overall this app has streamlined our operations and made the documents management smooth.”
