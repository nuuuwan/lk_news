TNA will talk to all candidates before making final decision

Colombo, June 5 (Daily Mirror) - The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) will decide on whom to support at the next Presidential election only after discussions with all candidates, MP M.A. Sumanthiran said.

"We will have to look at what the candidates come up with, and then we will hold discussions with them. Our final decision will be made only after this exercise," Sumanthiran told the media.

Asked about the claim by the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) that the TNA will support its leader Sajith Premadasa at the Presidential election, Sumanthiran said the SJB should be dreaming if it thinks his party would support Premadasa.

Also, he welcomed the land distribution programme carried out by the government. "The government's land distribution programme is good," he said.

Further, he said the TNA is against fielding a Tamil candidate at the Presidential election.
