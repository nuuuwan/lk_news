IMF Chief meets President Ranil, commends Sri Lanka’s economic reform efforts

Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Kristalina Georgieva commended the economic reform endeavors pursued by Sri Lanka during a meeting with President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

She emphasized the importance of the IMF Board approving the first review of Sri Lanka’s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program in December 2023, characterizing it as a recognition of the country’s significant reform initiatives.

Georgieva expressed her positive expectations on ‘X’ (formerly Twitter), stating that the reforms undertaken by Sri Lanka are beginning to yield positive results.

“Very good meeting with Ranil Wickremesinghe at WEF24. IMF Board approval of the First Review of the EFF program in December was a recognition of the important reforms Sri Lanka has pursued. These reforms are starting to pay off,” she tweeted.

Meanwhile, Pakistan’s caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar also met with President Wickremesinghe on the sidelines of the Forum.

During the meeting, the two parties discussed numerous matters pertaining to regional affairs, and ways to promote trade between Sri Lanka and Pakistan.
