UK to closely monitor Sri Lanka’s Online Safety Act amidst int’l concerns

Colombo, Feb 8 (Daily Mirror) - While claiming that the Sri Lankan Parliament passed the Online Safety Act on 24 January, despite concerns raised by international internet providers and various other concerned parties, the United Kingdom has stated that it will closely monitor the progress of this Act.

Despite concerns expressed by civil society, opposition parties and international internet providers regarding the potential negative impacts of the Online Safety Act, the Sri Lankan Parliament passed it into law on 24 January, Anne-Marie Trevelyan Minister of State (Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office) informed the UK Parliament.

“The UK also raised concerns about the impact of this Act on the freedom of expression and economic growth, including when I met Sri Lankan President Wickremesinghe in October, and when Lord (Tariq) Ahmad, Minister of State for South Asia, met Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry on 25 January,” she stated in a written statement to the UK Parliament.
