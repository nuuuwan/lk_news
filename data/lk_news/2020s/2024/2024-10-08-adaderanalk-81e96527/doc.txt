Minister Vijitha Herath clarifies new govt’s foreign relations policy

Cabinet Spokesman Minister Vijitha Herath emphasized that Sri Lanka maintains balanced diplomatic relations with all countries, reaffirming that no nation is given special treatment.

Speaking at the Cabinet press briefing this morning (08), Minister Herath stated, “We are doing business with China just as we are doing business with India.”

Furthermore, he addressed the government’s decision to allow a Chinese military training vessel to visit Sri Lanka later this month, noting that this falls within the framework of the country’s diplomatic engagements.

“The ship is scheduled to arrive in the port of Colombo this month,” he said.

Minister Herath also elaborated on the government’s foreign relations policy: “We don’t consider any country to be special. Whether it’s China, India, the United States, Russia, Cuba, or Vietnam, Sri Lanka maintains diplomatic relations with all countries—big or small. We have no bias in our approach.”

He cited recent developments, including a solar panel project in collaboration with China, as an example of the country’s cooperation with multiple partners.

“We are working on a project to provide solar panels to religious places in Sri Lanka. In a few days, we will be giving permission for that,” he noted, adding that military ships from various nations have also docked in Sri Lankan ports as part of routine diplomatic exchanges.

“American, Indian, and German warships have visited before. In such diplomatic relations, we engage with all countries equally,” he said.
