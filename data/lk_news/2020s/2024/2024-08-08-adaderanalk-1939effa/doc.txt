Siyam murder: SC confirms death sentences of Vass Gunawardena and others

The Supreme Court today (08) confirmed the death sentences imposed on former DIG Vass Gunawardena, his son Ravindu Gunawardena, and four others, who were found guilty of abducting and murdering businessman Mohammed Siyam in 2013.

The Supreme Court delivered this verdict while dismissing the appeal petitions filed by Vass Gunawardena and the other defendants seeking their acquittal.

Accordingly, the verdict, delivered after a prolonged trial, upholds the death sentences of the accused, which also include a Sub-Inspector (SI) and three Police Constables (PCs).
