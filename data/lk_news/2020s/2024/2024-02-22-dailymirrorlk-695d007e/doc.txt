Medical fraternity urges health authorities to be on alert

Colombo, Feb 22 (Daily Mirror) -  In light of recent findings suggesting potential rare occurrences of heart, brain, and blood disorders linked to certain Covid-19 vaccines, medical professionals in Sri Lanka urge the health authorities to remain vigilant on the development.

The study in question, conducted by researchers from the Global Vaccine Data Network, a research arm of the World Health Organization (WHO), unearthed Covid vaccines from companies like Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca were linked to rare occurrences of heart, brain and blood disorders.

It targeted population of 99 million vaccinated individuals across eight countries. This study is said to be the largest Covid vaccine study to date.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Media Spokesman Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe said it is better that Sri Lank goes on alert given the gravity of the findings of the study.

“It’s imperative that Sri Lanka maintains continued vigilance and observation of any potential side effects associated with Covid vaccines within the local context,” he stated.

“However, the findings of the study can’t be directly applied to Sri Lanka since the data on which the study was done distinguish from the Sri Lankan context. Furthermore, the factors like genetic patterns and related patterns also play a significant role,” he pointed out.

“Nevertheless, the Health Ministry should closely monitor the situation while pondering over the necessity to conduct a local survey,” Dr.Wijesinghe added.

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka's Health Ministry has affirmed that no proven study has been conducted in the country regarding the side effects of Covid vaccines.

However, the ministry asserts its commitment to monitoring the situation closely.
