Govt. launches probe into UK High Commissioner’s expenses amid scrutiny of diplomatic appointments

Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Vijitha Herath yesterday said the Government has initiated an investigation into alleged spending by the High Commissioner to the United Kingdom Rohitha Bogollagama.

Responding to queries posed during the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media reports concerning a vehicle reportedly used by Bogollagama, Herath clarified that the vehicle was purchased with the High Commissioner’s own funds, not with Government resources.

“We have seen the reports and received several complaints as well. We are looking into it,” he added.

The Minister confirmed that while no immediate recalls of overseas diplomats are planned, politically appointed diplomats may be recalled in due course as part of a broader evaluation process.

“Diplomatic changes will occur after these commitments have been fulfilled in a gradual manner,” the Cabinet Spokesman assured.

He acknowledged the Government’s commitment to scrutinising spending practices of diplomatic representatives abroad, as well as a review of politically motivated appointments.
