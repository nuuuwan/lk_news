Iran, Sri Lanka boost bilateral bonding in Uma Oya project unveiling

Colombo, April 24 (Daily Mirror) - Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi who was in Sri Lanka for a short visit to inaugurate the Uma Oya project said his country was ready for stronger ties with Sri Lanka as a sovereign, independent country.

At the function to mark the event, he said his country stands fully ready to further expand bilateral relations with all Asian countries, neighbouring countries, and sovereign and independent states.

The aircraft with the Iranian leader on board landed at the Mattala International Airport yesterday amidst tight security arrangements. He arrived from Pakistan where the two countries agreed to strengthen cooperation.

The Western countries tried to convince all others that knowledge and technology is exclusive to those countries,” he said.

He added that the “idea” was rooted in “colonialism and arrogance” and that Iran was now able to share its knowledge with others. According to him, Iran is currently having projects in 20 countries.

The Uma Outa project, valued at $514 million, was started in 2010 under the Mahinda Rajapaksa government. Iran initially provided US $ 50 million, but Sri Lanka encountered problems in securing further funding in 2013 due to the US sanctions on Iran. Afterwards, Sri Lanka proceeded with the project with its own fund but retained the same Iranian contractor Iran’s FARAB engineering group.

The project will add 290 GWh of electricity annually to the national grid and irrigate 4,500 hectares (11,100 acres) of new land and 1,500 hectares (3,700 acres) of existing agricultural land.

Iran is one of the largest markets for tea from Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka started bartering tea in lieu of $250 million owed for oil. The barter was agreed in 2021 for oil imported in 2012, but the exchange was delayed after Sri Lanka's unprecedented dollar shortage during the economic crisis.
