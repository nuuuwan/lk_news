Foreign powers intensify surveillance on Presidential elections as strategic interests take centre stage

Colombo, April 26 (Daily Mirror) - Ahead of the presidential election scheduled for October this year, the foreign powers have ramped up their efforts in the assessment of ground political developments as was in the case of vital elections in the past.

The political situation is likely to heat up after May Day events in which the respective parties will try to show their political might as a launching pad for electioneering.

It is natural for foreign countries having bilateral relations with Sri Lanka to be watchful of political developments with key elections pending. However, countries such as the United States, India, China, Japan, the United Kingdom and other Western countries take particular interest in the possible outcome of elections. They have strategic and competing interests in the country.

Currently, a delegation of the Communist Party of China (CPC) is in town for an assessment of the current political situation. The delegation comprising Deputy Minister of the International Affairs Department of the CPC Ms. Sun Haiyan held talks with the political parties.

Earlier, they had talks with a delegation led by the National People’s Power (NPP) including its leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake who is slated to contest the presidential elections. An informed source of the party said the CPC was keen to find out the actual standing of the NPP in Sri Lankan politics.

“The CPC delegation was keen to ascertain whether reports about our popularity correspond with ground realities,” the source said.

According to the source, the CPC delegation even had an inspection tour of the party headquarters while exchanging pleasantries with the members.

China, like the United States and India, has strategic interests in the country, and as a result is interested in assessing the possible outcome of the presidential elections well in advance.

Besides, the CPC delegation met with the representatives of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) including its founder Basil Rajapaksa and exchanged views on current politics.

The CPC, in its political headquarters in Beijing, has a separate wing for Sri Lanka. It is in touch with all the political parties in Sri Lanka as party to party relations.

Earlier, India also invited a NPP delegation led by its leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake for a familiarization visit.

The heightened vigilance of foreign powers in Sri Lanka's presidential elections reflect the geopolitical significance of the country and its potential impact on regional dynamics. As global players vie for influence in the Indian Ocean region, Sri Lanka's strategic location and evolving political landscape have become focal points of interest.

The engagement of countries like China, India, and the United States reflects their efforts to safeguard their respective interests, ranging from economic investments to geopolitical influence.
