President’s comments threaten entire judicial system and rule of law – BASL

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has reiterated its unwavering commitment to upholding the Rule of Law and safeguarding the independence of the judiciary, while addressing recent remarks made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament regarding the Supreme Court’s ruling on the ‘Gender Equality Bill’.

In a statement issued on Wednesday (19), the BASL emphasized that the Supreme Court has executed its constitutional duty by evaluating the bill’s alignment with supreme law of the land.

“While individuals have the right to agree or disagree, neither the legislature nor the executive should criticize the Court for performing its duty to the people,” the BASL stressed.

The BASL’s response comes after President Wickremesinghe’s remarks in Parliament on June 18, 2024, where he referred to the Supreme Court’s actions as ‘Judicial Cannibalism’ and suggested the formation of a select committee to review the Court’s determination. The BASL expressed grave concern over the relevant statement, viewing it as an attempt to undermine judicial independence and force through a Bill which has been decided to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.

“The judiciary should be allowed to function independently and free from any kind of external pressure,” the BASL asserted. The association further condemned the President’s comments as “a threat to the Supreme Court and to the entire judicial system in discharging the judicial function of the republic conferred by the Constitution.”

The BASL warned that establishing a parliamentary select committee to review the Supreme Court’s ruling on the constitutionality of a bill would set a dangerous precedent.

“It is the duty of both the executive and the legislature to respect the judiciary’s functions. Any interference could lead to severe adverse consequences and pose a significant threat to the Rule of Law in the country,” the BASL cautioned.
