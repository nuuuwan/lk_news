Maldives President seeks parliament approval for cooperation with Sri Lanka on criminal cases

The President of Maldives Dr Mohamed Muizzu has sent a letter to Maldives Parliament seeking approval for collaboration with Sri Lanka in criminal investigations.

The letter said the agreement is being made to further strengthen ties between the countries, and to provide mutual assistance in criminal investigation cases, foreign media reported.

Under the agreement, maximum assistance will be provided to investigate criminal cases within the laws and regulations of each country, and to carry out the criminal justice process.

The letter said that the government had decided on June 2 to enter the ‘Treaty between The Government of The Republic of Maldives and The Government of The Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters’, and added that parliament approval is needed to do so.

Article 115 (k.2) of the Constitution states that parliamentary approval must be obtained to enter into and ratify treaties and agreements with foreign states and international organizations, which impose obligations on citizens, according to foreign media.

The Speaker of Maldives Parliament has decided to task the Committee on Foreign Relations to further research the matter.
