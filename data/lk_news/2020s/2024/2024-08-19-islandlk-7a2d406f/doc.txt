NDB’s ‘Pancha Mama’ sparks financial savvy in young minds

NDB Bank recently conducted a series of workshops featuring NDB’s Pancha Mama, which aimed at fostering financial literacy and sustainable living habits among children. Held during June and July, these workshops reached schools, preschools, and other educational institutions in locations including Wattala, Minuwangoda, Ja-Ela, and Nittambuwa.

The workshops blended educational content with engaging activities to emphasise the importance of saving. Beyond financial savings, the sessions highlighted sustainable practices like conserving water and electricity and minimising waste. This holistic approach aims to instill lifelong habits of mindful resource management in young participants.

In addition to the children, the workshops also welcomed parents and teachers, with each session attracting about 200–250 participants. The interactive format, including fun games, made the sessions an enjoyable learning experience for all involved.
