Sri Lanka Coast Guard given ATVs by Australian Border Force

ECONOMYNEXT – The Australian Border Force has gifted Sri Lanka Coast Guard (SLCG) three all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) to boost SLCG’s existing land coastal patrol activities.

“Like Australia, we bear similar civil maritime security threats and are committed to working together to combat maritime crime,” Director-General of SLCG, Rear Admiral Pujitha Vithana said.

The small, motorised, off-highway vehicles are generally used on rough ground. The ATVs will be deployed in various places including Colombo, Galle, and Trincomalee.

Each ATV will be equipped with a land focussed drone to detect illegal activities in coastal areas.

SLCG will use the additional ATVs to uplift their existing onshore patrols and operational activity to protect the community from maritime crime and people smuggling, a joint statement by the Australian Border Force and SLCG said.

“These ATVs are part of Australia’s Enhanced Measures package for Sri Lanka, announced in 2023, and is another step in strengthening our relationship and reinforcing our mutual commitment in tackling various threats in the maritime domain,” Commander Joint Agency Task Force Operation Sovereign Borders, Rear Admiral Brett Sonter said.
