UAE deports Sri Lankans arrested over cybercrimes and prostitution

Eleven Sri Lankans deported from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for engaging in cybercrimes have arrived in the island this morning (06), the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) said.

On July 01, Khaleej Times reported that thousands of individuals, including many South Asians and Africans were entrapped during a crackdown conducted across locations in Dubai recently, with the largest raid at Rahaba Residences in Dubailand.

The UAE authorities also dismantled major cybercrime syndicates in an all-night operation across the UAE, resulting in the arrest of hundreds of cybercriminals and the rescue of numerous individuals recently.

However, following an investigation carried out by the Sri Lankan Embassy in the UAE, it has been revealed that among the arrestees were 37 Sri Lankans, detained on charges including cybercrimes and prostitution.

The Sri Lankan Embassy in the UAE confirmed that the remaining 26 Sri Lankans will be deported within two weeks, following the completion of police investigations. Upon their arrival in Sri Lanka, further investigations will be conducted by the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau.
