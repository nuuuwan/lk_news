Fairly heavy showers, strong winds expected in parts of the island

The prevailing showery and windy conditions over the island are expected to continue further, due to the active Southwest Monsoonal condition, according to the Meteorology Department.

Showers will occur at times in Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central and Southern provinces while several spells of showers will occur in North-western province.

Fairly heavy showers above 75 mm are likely at some places in Western and Sabaragamuwa province and in Nuwara-Eliya district.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at a few places in Uva province and in Ampara and Batticaloa districts in the evening or night, it said.

Strong winds of about 50-60 kmph can be expected at times over Western slopes of the central hills and in North-central, Western, Southern and North-western provinces and in Trincomalee and Monaragala districts.

The sea areas around the island will be rough or very rough due to the active south-west monsoonal condition.

Naval and fishing communities are advised not to venture into the sea areas extending from Kankasanthurai to Pottuvil via Mannar, Colombo, Galle and Hambantota, until further notice and be vigilant in the other sea areas around the island.

Waves heights may increase up to about 2.5 m â€“ 3.5 m in the sea areas off the coast, extending from Kalpitiya to Pottuvil via Colombo, Galle, and Hambantota.

Therefore, there is a possibility that nearshore sea areas extending from Kalpitiya to Matara via Colombo and Galle, may experience surges due to sea waves.

Temporarily strong gusty winds and very rough seas can be expected during thundershowers.
