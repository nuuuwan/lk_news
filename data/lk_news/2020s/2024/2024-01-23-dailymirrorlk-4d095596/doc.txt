Hailing from the Rotary Club of  South Queensferry in Scotland, McInally’s extensive Rotarian journey  since 1984 and his various leadership roles within Rotary International  in Great Britain and Ireland underscore his unwavering commitment to  service.

The forthcoming four-day visit aims to fortify bonds and  encourage collaboration between Rotary International and the  enthusiastic Rotary community in Sri Lanka. President McInally will kick  off his visit by addressing the dynamic youth organizations of Interact  and Rotaract at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel. Following this, a key moment  during President McInally’s visit is the anticipated signing of a  Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Ministry of Health,  highlighting Rotary International’s dedication to supporting health  initiatives in Sri Lanka. The subsequent day will witness a visit to the  National Hospital, where Emergency Medical Equipment will be handed  over, and support for the Cancer Screening Project will further  underscore Rotary’s commitment to addressing critical healthcare needs  in the country.

An intercity meeting will facilitate direct interaction  between President McInally and Rotarians of District 3220 Sri Lanka and  the Maldives, fostering connections and fortifying ties between Rotary  International and the Rotary community in Sri Lanka and the Maldives.  The highlight of the visit will be a Charity Banquet Dinner scheduled to  commence at 6:30 PM at the Shangri-La Colombo, celebrating Rotary’s  values and shared commitment to meaningful service.

President McInally’s strategy for increasing membership  emphasizes active engagement from Rotary International, regional  leaders, and district teams with clubs. His objective is to expand  Rotary in both membership and its ability to provide meaningful service  through enhanced engagement. Acknowledging Rotary’s adaptability during  the COVID-19 pandemic, McInally envisions a future where Rotary  continues to grow and increase engagement by integrating technological  advancements with proven best practices. For the 2023-24 Rotary year,  McInally has chosen the theme, ‘Create Hope in the World,’ focusing on  restoring hope to help the world heal from conflicts and achieve lasting  change. His visit to Sri Lanka is anticipated to infuse new hope into  the country and further solidify the ties between Rotary International  and the local community.
