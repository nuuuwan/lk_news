Sri Lanka President promises to unify nation, build a country without war

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka should move forward together with the North and South, and all ethnic groups working together to build a country without war for the next generation, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.

“We have focused on several issues that will be solved during a National People’s Power administration,” President Dissanayake told a rally in Jaffna in Sri Lanka’s North.

“First of all, we will build national unity. The North and South were at war. After 30 years of war, there were tears and lost family members. We have to build country without war for the next generation.

“This is the responsibility of this generation. The distrust, anger between the Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims has to be removed. The NPP will build a united nation.”

The NPP will take action one by one to remove the distrust, he said.

“We will act so that people will feel this is our government.”

A free and peaceful environment will be built in the North he said.

Step by step land taken over by the government will be released.

“”There was a war. Things that should not happen happened. We will release people who are still in prisons,” President Dissanayake said.

“There cannot be a mentality of a half-free persons. We have to build a country where freedoms are enjoyed equally.’
