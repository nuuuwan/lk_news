Colombo Fashion Week 2024 to shine spotlight on sustainability

Colombo Fashion Week (CFW) returns from March 6th to 9th 2024, for its 21st edition, marking a significant milestone and promising a future brimming with innovation for the fashion industry of Sri Lanka. This year the platform focuses on multiple locations around Colombo to make the city come alive, as it’s also an apt time for travelers to experience the creativity and cultural richness of Colombo.

Since 2003, CFW has played a pivotal role in reviving, guiding, and building pride in Sri Lanka’s fashion industry. From humble beginnings featuring a handful of designers, it has blossomed into a thriving ecosystem embracing sustainability and empowering young talent. More than 80% of today’s leading Sri Lankan designers are the product of CFW’s development system, a testament to its impact.

Under the leadership of Managing Director Ajai Vir Singh, CFW has championed sustainability, introducing initiatives such as Ethical Fashion Day, the Responsible Fashion Summit, and the innovative tool, Responsible Meter. These efforts have positioned CFW as a leader in ethical fashion globally, attracting renowned designers from Europe, Australia, and South Asia, alongside esteemed Sri Lankan designers, fostering knowledge exchange, and showcasing the burgeoning talent of Sri Lankan designers alongside established industry names.
