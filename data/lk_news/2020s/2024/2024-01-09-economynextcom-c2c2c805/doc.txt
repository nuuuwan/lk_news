ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet of ministers has approved the opening and re-opening of several diplomatic missions including in Kazakhstan but it will be done on a staggered basis, giving regard to the ongoing financial crisis, Minister Bandula Gunawardana said.

The offices would be opened on a staggered basis and embassies were not being opened simply to give jobs to people, he said.

“There is no situation like that,” Minister Gunawardana told reporters. “The President gave instructions that though there was a policy decision, we may not be able to do all this in one year.

“In this financial crisis, approval was given to do it step by step, in phases,” he said.

In the case of Kazakhstan, the Foreign Minister has explained it was important because the headquarters of Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia, and it gave an opportunity to strengthen relations with central Asia.
