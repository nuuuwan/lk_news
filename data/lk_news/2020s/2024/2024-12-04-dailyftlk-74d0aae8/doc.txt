Shanakiyan urges Govt. to clarify stance on Provincial Councils

Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi (ITAK) MP Shanakiyan Rasamanickam has urged the Government led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to clarify its position on the future of the Provincial Council system.

Citing recent remarks to the media by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) General Secretary Tilvin Silva, who has suggested the system might be abolished, Rasamanickam called for an official response on the matter. The MP raised the question prior to yesterday’s Parliamentary debate on the President’s policy statement, emphasising that the issue is of national significance and has sparked widespread public concern.

Leader of the House Bimal Rathnayake responded by reaffirming the Government’s respect for Rasamanickam but noted that the matter was not directly relevant to the day’s Parliamentary agenda. “Do not be spoiled by those around you,” Rathnayake said.

He assured the ITAK MP that the Government would provide clarity in due course and revealed that ITAK leader Sivagnanam Shritharan had already requested a meeting with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

“This meeting will be arranged within the week, giving MP Rasamanickam an opportunity to directly present his concerns to President Dissanayake,” Rathnayake said.
