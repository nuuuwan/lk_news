Bandula asserts sovereignty amid US concerns over Online Safety Act

Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena yesterday reaffirmed Sri Lanka’s sovereignty and legislative authority in response to concerns raised by the US regarding the recently passed Online Safety Act.

“Sri Lanka is not a State of the US but a sovereign country with the legislative power to enact laws for the country’s governance,” he said in response to a query posed at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing.

The comments came in the wake of expressions of concern from the US Ambassador in Colombo and US Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy Elizabeth Allen regarding the potential impact of the proposed amendments on freedom of expression, innovation and privacy.

Co-Cabinet Spokesman Gunawardena assured that any amendments to the legislation would undergo Parliamentary scrutiny and the civil society organisations opposed to the legislation would have the opportunity to challenge it within the 14-day timeframe.

“The Government’s intention is not to control social media platforms but to prevent the dissemination of content that incites religious extremism, community violence, bullying, sexual harassment and violence,” he clarified.

On 24 January, the Online Safety Bill was passed in Parliament with a majority of MPs supporting the bill. However, the Opposition raised concerns that the amendments proposed were not consistent with the Supreme Court’s determination.

The proposed amendments to the Online Safety Act have sparked debate in Sri Lanka, with some expressing concerns about the potential curtailment of freedom of expression and the impact on digital rights.
