EC issues statement regarding ballot boxes for Presidential Election

The Election Commission announced that the cardboard boxes, designated for use as ballot boxes in this yearâ€™s presidential election, have been dispatched to all returning officers across the island.

The respective retuning officers will deliver these ballot boxes to polling stations on September 20.

Due to the larger size of the ballot papers, the Election Commission has decided to utilize cardboard boxes instead of the traditional wooden boxes. The commission stated that the boxes have been produced in three different sizes.

Additionally, the Election Commission confirmed that all preparations for the polling process have been completed and necessary instructions have been issued to government officials.

Officials involved in election duties are advised to finalize arrangements and travel to their designated polling stations on the appointed day.
