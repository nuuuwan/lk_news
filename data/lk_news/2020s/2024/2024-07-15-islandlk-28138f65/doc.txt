In Sri Lanka…on vacation

Over the past few weeks, former big names in the local showbiz scene, now based abroad, have been visiting Sri Lanka…after quite a while.

Legendary drummer of the Super Golden Chimes, and Gypsies fame, Nimal Perera, is in town for a short holiday.

Kirthie Abeywickreme, who lives in Germany, and is known for his classic impersonation of Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley and Tina Turner, for the purpose of entertainment, is here, as well.

Also in town, for a short vacation, was Sondra Wise Kumaraperu…better known in the scene here as Sondra Wise.

She was a popular vocalist and performed with several of our top bands before settling down in America.

Sondra is now heavily involved in various projects in the States, but, unfortunately, not connected with music.

During her trip to Sri Lanka, she also visited the Maldives, for a couple of days.
