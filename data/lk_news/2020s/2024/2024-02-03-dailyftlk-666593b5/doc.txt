Cabinet approves enhanced benefits  under Aswesuma welfare program

The Cabinet of Ministers has approved the implementation of the Aswesuma Scheme, with significant revisions aimed at extending support to vulnerable social groups.

The scheme, which has already been in effect, will undergo key changes to enhance its impact on those facing economic challenges.

The approved revisions include the number of eligible families set to increase to 2.4 million, reflecting an inclusion of additional eligible families. It also includes initiating the call for applications for the second round within the first quarter of 2024 and finalising it by June 2024, the revised scheme aims to make payments starting from July.

In addition, extending the valid period for the vulnerable social group among those qualified for Aswesuma benefits, effective from 1 April to 31 December 2024. Similarly, the valid period for the transitional social group, particularly those experiencing temporary income deterioration due to an economic crisis, will be extended from 1 January to 31 December 2024.

An important aspect of the revision involves amalgamating the existing vulnerable social group and the transitional social group. From 1 January onwards, 800,000 families will be considered a vulnerable group, receiving a monthly allowance of Rs. 5,000 till 31 December 2024.

Furthermore, the confirmation of information will trigger additional payments under the Aswesuma Scheme. Patients suffering from unidentified kidney diseases, disabled persons, and elderly individuals included in the Aswesuma family list will receive Rs. 7,500, Rs. 7,500, and Rs. 3,000, respectively, starting from April 2024.

To streamline the process, District Secretaries and Divisional Secretaries will oversee the payment of Rs. 7,500 for patients with unidentified kidney diseases, Rs. 7,500 for disabled persons, and Rs. 3,000 for elderly persons.

“The revised Aswesuma Scheme reflects a commitment to addressing the evolving needs of vulnerable communities and enhancing the impact of welfare initiatives to enhance social well-being,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman Bandula Gunawardena said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing.
