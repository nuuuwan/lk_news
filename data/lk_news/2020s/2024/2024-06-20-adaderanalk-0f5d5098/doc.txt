Prison officers warned against engaging in trade union action

The Prisons Department has warned that strict disciplinary measures will be taken against officers who engage in trade union actions.

Prisons Commissioner (Operation/Intelligence) and Spokesman Gamini B. Dissanayake emphasized that prison officers have no legal right to participate in any trade union actions.

Dissanayake also warned that legal action would be pursued against any officers who engage in such activities.

Regarding the recent trade union action by certain prison officers, Dissanayake noted, “It was reported to us that a very small group of officers had intimidated others into joining them. The Colombo Magistrate has ordered that disciplinary action be taken. A senior officer will be assigned, and appropriate measures will be implemented. We intend to report facts to the court on this in the future.”
