Mahinda Siriwardene granted service extension as Finance Secretary

The Secretary to the Ministry of Finance Mahinda Siriwardene has been granted a service extension of one year.

This term extension will be effective from 26 April 2024, the Finance Ministry said.

Meanwhile on Friday (26), Siriwardena announced that he will be retiring from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), after more than 33 years of service. He held the position of Deputy Governor of the Central Bank.

However, Mr. Siriwardana, who is completing his service period as Treasury Secretary this month, had said that he will continue to serve as the Secretary to the Treasury and Ministry of Finance.

Accordingly, he will be given a one-year extension as Secretary to the Treasury and Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies.
