More of Suzi…Down Under

Suzi Fluckiger (or, let’s say Croner to her fans in Sri Lanka) has already turned out to be a much-in-demand artiste, Down Under.

She was in Melbourne, Australia, in November last year, for Country and Western Night at Gaelic Park, in Keysborough, and the crowd present enjoyed her performance.

She also did quite a few other gigs, and now they all want more of Suzi.

And, Suzi says she will do the needful again, in October this year.

She is scheduled to do a country and western scene on October 26, in Melbourne, followed by two other gigs, on November 1st and 2nd.

Suzi then has to rush back to Switzerland, where she now resides, as she has to perform in Zurich, from November 9th right through to January, 2025.

Referring to her forthcoming two-week stay in Australia, she says it will be partying with all her Aussie friends, all the time!
