Senior oncologist at Karapitiya Hospital remanded over alleged assault

The senior oncologist who was arrested for allegedly assaulting a female junior staff member at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, has been remanded.

Accordingly, the accused was remanded until 22 January, on orders of the Galle Magistrate’s Court.

61-year-old Dr. S. C. R. Perera was arrested earlier today (18 Jan.), for allegedly assaulting a female junior staff member at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital during a contentious situation that had ensued on Wednesday (17 Jan.).

He had assaulted the staff member during a heated argument between him and the other staffers on Wednesday morning after he accused them of disrupting hospital services by going on a token strike the day before.

The hospital’s authorities had brought the situation under control, however, a female junior staff member got herself admitted to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, citing an assault by the senior oncologist.
