Nestlé Lanka fosters positive behavioural change towards responsible waste management

Nestlé Lanka’s All-Island Schools Art Competition on Preserving Mother Earth through the Expression of Art concluded last week, awarding the winners of the Junior and Senior categories. This competition was organized in celebration of World Environment Day together with the Ministry of Education and Central Environmental Authority (CEA). The art competition received a striking 80,000 entries from students representing schools across the island.

“The School Waste Management Programme is an important initiative in our journey towards creating a waste-free future. Educating school children on responsible waste management helps strengthen the segregation and collection of waste and inspire positive behavioural change. In this journey, we remain steadfast in our commitment of ensuring 95% of our plastic packaging is designed for recycling by 2025, taking continuous action to make our plastic packaging recyclable and reusable. We are delighted to have helped organize the Art Competition which not only served as a platform for showcasing the creative skills of emerging artists, but also helped reinforce the importance of taking action towards a greener and cleaner tomorrow. My heartfelt congratulations to all the participants and the winners!” said Bernie Stefan, Managing Director, Nestlé Lanka.
