India extends relief assistance to flood-affected regions  in Northern Province

In a significant gesture of solidarity, the High Commission of India in Colombo extended relief assistance to the people of the Northern Province, responding to the recent floods that caused displacement and hardship.

On behalf of the High Commission, the distribution was carried out by Consul General of India in Jaffna Shri Sai Murali, alongside MP Kader Masthan last Saturday (7).

Approximately 2,100 families from flood-affected areas in the Pesalai and Vellankulam villages (Mannar District) and Thunukkai and Manthai East (Mullaitivu District) received essential aid. The relief package included mats and blankets, providing much-needed support to families during this difficult time.

This assistance reflects the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, emphasising India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy. India remains committed to standing by its neighbours in times of need, ensuring timely and effective relief to affected communities.
