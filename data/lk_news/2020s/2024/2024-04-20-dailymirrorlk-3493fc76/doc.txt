MP Digambaram to support plantation workersâ€™ strike on Monday

The Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) fully supports the strike that the plantation workers are scheduled to launch from Monday (22), Nuwara Eliya District Member of Parliament Palani Digambaram said during a media conference held in Hatton today.

Even though President Ranil Wickremesinghe has advised the tea plantation companies to increase the daily salary of plantation workers to Rs 1,700, they have refused to increase the salaries.

"The plantation companies have expressed their agreement to increase the amount of Rs. 400 in addition to the daily salary of Rs.1,000 currently paid to a plantation worker. It has been agreed to give the remaining Rs. 300 with conditions," the MP said.

MP Digambaram further said that under the Samagi Jana Balawega government led by Sajith Premadasa, they will distribute tea lands to the plantation workers and make them small tea plantation owners and increase the daily income of the plantation workers.
