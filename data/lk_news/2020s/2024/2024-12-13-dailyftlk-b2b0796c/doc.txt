Relatives of Major General Janaka Perera call for fresh investigation into his killing

Relatives of the late Major General Janaka Perera, including his brother have filed a formal complaint with the Ministry of Public Security, urging a renewed investigation into the circumstances surrounding his assassination and that of his wife, Wajira Perera. The couple was killed in a suicide bombing on 6 October 2008, in Anuradhapura.

Speaking to the media, Priyantha Perera, a family member, revealed that the relatives have suspicions about the involvement of a particular regional politician other than those previously held responsible. He said that the family has requested the Ministry of Public Security to launch a formal investigation and intends to submit a separate appeal to the President.

The 2008 bombing targeted the United National Party (UNP) office near the old bus stand in Anuradhapura. The attack claimed the lives of 27 civilians and politicians, including Major General Perera, his wife, four UNP provincial councillors, and former Sri Lankan Ambassador Dr. Rajah Johnpullé and his wife. Over 90 others sustained injuries. The Government at the time, led by President Mahinda Rajapaksa, attributed the attack to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).

A decorated war hero, Major General Perera was a vocal critic of the military strategy employed by the Government during the civil conflict. Advocating for a balanced approach combining military action with political initiatives, he joined the UNP before the August 2008 North Central Provincial Council elections and was named the party’s chief ministerial candidate. However, the election, marred by violence, resulted in a victory for the ruling coalition, with Perera assuming the role of Leader of the Opposition.

The renewed calls for an investigation highlight lingering questions about the bombing and its perpetrators, with the family determined to seek clarity and justice for Major General Perera and his wife.
