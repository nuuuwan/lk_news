Speed limit process to be streamlined to reduce accidents: Alagiyawanna

Colombo, Jan. 17 (Daily Mirror)- Steps are being taken to streamline the speed limit process to reduce accidents in a move to ensure road safety, State Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said today.

He said this during a news conference held at the Presidential Media Centre today under the theme "Collective Path to a Stable Country."

"While alcohol detection is currently operational for drivers, a new initiative targets legal action against drivers under the influence of drugs, implemented nationwide since this year, with an initial phase in the Western and Southern Provinces. Plans for enhancing driver education and safety include implementing a programme to inform drivers about first aid in the event of an accident, with future intentions to incorporate related questions into the driver's license test," he said.

"With approximately 8.9 million vehicles and 8.5 million licensed drivers in the country, efforts are underway to standardize all district offices issuing licenses to the level of the Werahera head office by year-end," he added.

Minister Alagiyawanna assured that the ongoing issue in the issuing of driver's licenses will be addressed by October, with a shift towards providing permanent licenses through a one-day service rather than temporary ones.

He highlighted ongoing programmes and the Ministry's efforts to amend the existing Motor Vehicles Act by introducing a new act.
