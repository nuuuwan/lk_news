Navy vessel receives critical fisherman from merchant ship

The Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) in Colombo coordinated the retrieval of two critically ill fishermen on the multi-day fishing trawler “Devon 5”, through the merchant ship ‘MV KOTA CAMIL’ this morning (30).

However, one of the two fishermen has tragically lost his life, while aboard the merchant ship.

The remaining fisherman was transferred to SLNS Vijayabahu this evening (30), about 170 nautical miles (314 km) off Dondra, according to the Sri Lanka Navy.

The Navy medical team aboard SLNS Vijayabahu is delivering emergency treatment to the critically ill fisherman.

Additionally, SLNS Vijayabahu is en route to shores, carrying the body of the other fisherman who tragically lost his life onboard ‘MV KOTA CAMIL0’, the navy said.

A total of five fishermen have died thus far after the crew of a fishing vessel had consumed the contents of a bottle they found floating in the sea, assuming it was liquor.

It was reported this morning (30) that the death toll had increased to four while two others are in critical condition and that the two fishermen who were critically ill had been taken aboard a Singaporean merchant vessel and were provided with emergency treatment.

The Singaporean vessel was expected to transfer the two fishermen to SLNS Vijayabahu at sea.

However, one of the two fishermen had also passed away leaving just one survivor from the six-man crew of the fishing trawler.

The Director General of the Department of Fisheries & Aquatic Resources, Susantha Kahawatta, stated yesterday that the crew of the fishing boat named “Devon 5,” which had set out to sea from the Tangalle fisheries harbor, have faced this predicament after they had found several bottles containing an unknown liquid floating in the sea and consumed some of it assuming that it was alcohol.
