Some ministers seem determined to promote immorality through Diana Gamageâ€™s programs

Colombo, May 12 (Daily Mirror) - It is clear that some Ministers seem determined to promote immorality and erode morality by perpetuating the illegal and immoral programmes initiated by former State Minister Diana Gamage, Venerable Omalpe Sobitha Thera said.

Addressing the media, the thera said that Diana Gamage does not seem to have done anything for the country.

"The only thing that was done was that she raised her voice about the promotion of ganja and the promotion of immorality," he said.

The conspiratorial act she tried to do by developing immorality in the country, destroying morals and showing the illusion of economic development has now stopped due to the court decision. But some Ministers want to continue those programmes, he added.

According to the court decision, the role of Diana Gama has been rejected. That character does not suit social leadership at all. Finally, since she is not a Sri Lankan, she has no right to engage in politics in this country, the thera said.
