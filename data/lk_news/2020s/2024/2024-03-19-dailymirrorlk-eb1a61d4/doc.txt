Haven’t read Gota’s book, not even willing to: Basil

Colombo, March 19 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) founder Basil Rajapaksa said that he had not read the book published recently by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on an alleged conspiracy to oust him.

While addressing a television interview yesterday, he said that he did not have such a book at home.

"Gotabaya did not even give me a copy of his book," he said.

When the television presenter asked whether he had read the digital version of Gotabaya's book, Basil Rajapaksa said he had not received such a digital copy of the book till now.

"I did not receive a copy of the book from the media division of the SLPP," he said.

"I'm not in any anger about this book. But I came to know unofficially that Gotabaya Rajapaksa was going to write a book and was collecting details to complete it," he added.

Basil Rajapaksa claimed that even Namal had bought the book from a bookshop. Then the presenter claimed that Namal could buy that book as he still claimed to be a baby.

"I did not hope to receive the book from Gotabaya Rajapaksa. There is no misunderstands in our families, and there are no issue over not offering the book to me,"  Basil Rajapaksa said during the television programme.
