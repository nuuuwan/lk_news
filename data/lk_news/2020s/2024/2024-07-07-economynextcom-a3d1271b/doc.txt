Sri Lanka engaging with local banks on sovereign bonds restructure

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is engaging with local banks on their sovereign bond holdings, State Minister for Finance Shehan Semasinghe said after a deal was struck with foreign investors to restructure bonds.

Sri Lanka has now reached final or in-principle deals with most of the debt with domestic rupee debt completed, bilateral debt also final agreements also being reached as well as the latest deal with foreign investors holding sovereign bonds.

However about 15 percent of the sovereign bonds outstanding are held with private local banks, who have their own advisors.

“…It is important to pay attention to the balance figure, the central bank and our advisors and the ministry of finance will attend,” Minister Semansinghe said.

The deal with foreign sovereign bond holders indicated a 28 percent initial hair-cut which will be reduced to 15 percent if GDP grows at a certain speed.

Sri Lanka banks have provided for about 50 percent or more of the holdings, Fitch Ratings has reported.

Sri Lanka banks have previously asked for ISBs to be repaid in rupees as was the case with Sri Lanka Development Bonds.
