Indian Warship rescues crew members from attacked ship in Gulf of Aden

March 07 - An Indian warship, INS Kolkata, swiftly responded to a distress call in the Gulf of Aden, rescuing 21 crew members from the cargo ship 'True Confidence' after it was targeted by a missile launched by Houthi rebels.

Among those rescued were two Sri Lankans, one of whom sustained injuries during the attack, as reported by the Sri Lanka Navy Spokesman.

The incident occurred on March 6th when the Barbados-flagged Bulk Carrier MV True Confidence came under attack by a drone or missile approximately 55 nautical miles southwest of Aden. The attack ignited a fire onboard and resulted in critical injuries to several crew members, though specific details about the injured Sri Lankan are yet to be disclosed. It remains unclear if there were additional Sri Lankan nationals among the ship's crew.

In a display of swift response and maritime cooperation, INS Kolkata reached the scene promptly and conducted the rescue operation using its integral helicopter and boats. The ship's medical team provided vital medical assistance to the injured crew members.
