ACCA’s Approved Employer Program elevates finance careers and industry standards

Prioritising the needs of both professionals and employers, The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) is setting benchmarks in the finance sector, by placing employability at the heart of its mission through its Approved Employer Program.

ACCA Business Development Manager - Members and Employers Ruchera Jayawardena Peries emphasised “our mission is to develop highly skilled, globally recognised finance professionals, equipped with the skills employer’s demand. This not only enhances individual careers but also elevates standards across the entire finance profession.”

Elaborating on the ACCA Approved Employer Program, Ruchera stated “this program acknowledges employers that are committed to professional growth and development, where we offer them global recognition and access to valuable resources that enhance their training standards, making them attractive to top finance talent seeking supportive environments to complete their ACCA qualifications. They also enjoy a streamlined Practical Experience Requirement (PER) process, allowing students to bypass the sign-off procedure, which simplifies the path to qualification. Additionally, approved employers gain exclusive access to ACCA resources, including regular updates, training materials, and best practices, helping them stay at the forefront of industry developments.

Ruchera explained that to become an ACCA Approved Employer, organisations must commit to staff development, maintain structured training, and adhere to ACCA’s ethical standards. The program offers two recognition categories: Trainee Development (Gold and Platinum levels) for supporting ACCA students and affiliates, and Professional Development for providing ongoing development to ACCA members.

Ruchera clarified that the application process is straightforward. “Employers can apply online, submit supporting documents, and we assess their training programs against ACCA’s standards. Once approved, the status is valid for three years.” Successful applicants receive an official certificate, are listed in ACCA’s directory of Approved Employers, and can proudly use the ACCA Approved Employer logo in recruitment and marketing materials.

One notable advantage is that ACCA does not charge a fee for the application process. This ensures that employers of all sizes can participate in the program without financial barriers.

For ACCA students and members, the benefits are substantial. Ruchera highlighted, “students working for Approved Employers benefit from streamlined processes for completing their Practical Experience Requirements (PER) and receive structured, high-quality training that boosts their career prospects.”

With over 7,800 ACCA Approved Employers across 111 countries, the program has received widespread acclaim. “It’s a win-win for both employers and employees, fostering a sustainable talent pool for the finance industry,” noted Ruchera.

For companies interested in becoming ACCA Approved Employers, a comprehensive application guide is available. It includes eligibility criteria, application steps, required documentation, and an overview of the approval process.  Employers can access the guide on the ACCA website.

Ruchera summed up saying , “The ACCA Approved Employer Program is a critical bridge between employers and our talented finance professionals, ensuring a bright future for the industry.’ The initiative continues to enhance professional development while helping companies secure the talent they need to succeed.
