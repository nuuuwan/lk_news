Sri Lanka should focus on alternative crops: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka needs to shift to growing alternative crops instead of having a sole focus on paddy cultivation, the country’s Minister of Agriculture has said.

Due to years of protection, Sri Lanka does not produce export competitive, globally traded grades of rice like in East Asia.

“We need to focus on alternative crops such as maize, green gram and undu,” Minister of Agriculture, Mahinda Amaraweera said at a press briefing on Friday.

Sri Lanka has imposed import controls and high taxes on several grains including undu (vigna mungu), which give unfair profits to domestic producers, and has led to smuggling and high prices.

After Sri Lanka’s foreign exchange crisis in 2022, the Agriculture Ministry has been trying to shift growers’ focus to exportable crops.

Sri Lanka has been promoting the cultivation of banana and mango variants with a global demand such as sour banana and TJC mango in Jaffna and Hambantota. Sri Lanka king coconut is also in high demand, Amaraweera said earlier this week, adding that a nut can fetch around 2,000 rupees.

“The export agriculture crops sector currently compromises of traditional 14 export-oriented crops including cinnamon, pepper, coffee, nutmeg, clove, cardamom and cocoa,” Ministry of Agriculture additional secretary, Tharangani Wickramasinghe said. (Colombo/Mar1/2024)
