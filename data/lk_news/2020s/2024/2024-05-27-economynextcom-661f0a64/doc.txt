Sri Lanka may run out hotel rooms for high-end tourists: Official

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka may run out of hotel rooms for high-spending tourists, by the end of 2025, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, Priyantha Fernando, said.

“If the trend continues by the end of next year, we will be short of rooms,” Fernando told EconomyNext on the sidelines of Sancharaka Udawa, a tourism fair.

“The high-end hotels which are charging over 250-300 dollars per night has been having very high occupancy at very high rates.

“But we will have to match the product with the expectations of the people because right now it’s about 10,500 rooms which we offered for high end tourists island wide.”

Hotels chains like Cinnamon began new ventures such as eco-excursion.

ITC, a new high end recently opened in Colombo and Cinnamon Life is expected to open later in the year.

In order to target high-spending tourists, the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau announced in January the start of a 1.5 billion rupee promotional campaign in 11 key markets including China, Russia, UK and Germany.

Sri Lanka plans to attract 2.3 million tourists which may go up to 2.5 million under a master plan, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, Chalaka Gajabahu, said at Sancharaka Udawa.

The tourist industry, however, have expressed concern over reaching the target due to summer visitors being put off by minimum room rates and a high fee and a complex website run by VFS Global, a private company after an earlier simple website was scrapped. (Colombo/May27/2024)
