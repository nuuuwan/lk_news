IMF awaiting more information for final sign-off on Sri Lanka bondholder deal

ECONOMYNEXT – The International Monetary Fund is awaiting more details on Sri Lanka’s deal with sovereign bondholders to assess its compliance, Mission Chief Peter Breuer said.

“We are currently awaiting additional information and will provide the authorities with an assessment of the agreed terms to ensure consistency with the parameters and debt sustainability objectives under the IMF-supported program,” he said.

Advisors from both sides prepare deals on the belief that they are compliant with the IMF’s Debt Sustainability Analysis.

But during first round of talks, private bondholders were said to have been not fully able to prepare a proposal in line with the DSA unlike Sri Lanka, requiring more information on exactly how the April proposal was deemed to be in line with analysis.
