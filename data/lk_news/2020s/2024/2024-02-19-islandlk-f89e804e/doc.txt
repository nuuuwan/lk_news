This year, various lecturers with exceptional knowledge from Japan covered a broad range of topics with one goal in mind: to nurture the young generation who will be responsible for recovery from current economic crisis and future growth.

The new program was also included: the visit to the Colombo Dockyard, a leading shipbuilding company, which provided insight into Japanese-style company administration and human resource management and its huge role for the country’s economic development.

At the panel discussion, three students actively discussed what they have learned from JICA Chair Program which reviews the economic growth through agricultural development and modernization by introducing competition law and policy in Japan, etc. and how they can apply the Japanese development and modernization experience in Sri Lanka.

JICA will continuously strengthen human connectivity between Sri Lanka and Japan and empower the future leaders in Sri Lanka through JICA Chair Program.
