Dry weather affects reservoirs

The water levels of the hydropower reservoirs used for hydropower generation have been dwindling fast due to the prevailing dry weather.

Engineers in charge of Maussakele and Castlereigh reservoirs said the water levels in the two reservoirs have reduced by 25 percent.

They said the water level in Castelreigh reservoir stood at 24.5 feet below spill level and that of Maussakele reservoir 22.8 ft below spill level. They pointed out that the reservoirs would be further affected if the dry weather persisted.

They also said that steps have been taken to prevent any impact on the power supply.
