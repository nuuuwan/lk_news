Health Sector Gripped by Strikes as 72 Professions Walk Out

Colombo (News 1st) â€“ Sri Lanka's healthcare sector faces significant disruption today as members of 72 health unions representing a wide range of professionals, including laboratory technicians, radiology technicians, pharmacists, public health inspectors, midwives, drug compounders, and entomology officers, have decided to launch a strike.

The action, led by the Health Service Trade Union Alliance is set to continue until 8 am tomorrow.

The strike stems from a recent decision by the President, also serving as the Minister of Finance, to increase the duty interruption, attendance, and transport allowance (DAT) for doctors by 35,000 rupees.

Union Convenor Ravi Kumadesh has criticized the move as discriminatory and demanded similar financial incentives for other healthcare professionals.

Adding to the tension, government nurses are also poised to launch a 24-hour symbolic strike starting at 7 am tomorrow.

News First reached out to Health Minister Ramesh Pathirana for comment, and he noted that the matter is under discussion with acting Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe.

The widespread strikes raise concerns about potential disruptions in healthcare services across Sri Lanka.

Patients seeking non-emergency care may face delays or cancellations, while critical services could be stretched thin.
