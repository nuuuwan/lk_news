A future SJB government will close down liquor shops, taverns: Sajith

A future Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) government will close down all taverns and liquor shops, Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa said today.

"Exceptions will be made only where tourism is concerned," Premadasa told a public gathering.

"We will also begin a temporal movement right from the school level. This will be done to save the children of this country. I know I will lose votes for saying this, but it will be done for the sake of the children," he added.

"Also, all liquor licences which have been given now will be cancelled if we come to power," Premadasa claimed.
