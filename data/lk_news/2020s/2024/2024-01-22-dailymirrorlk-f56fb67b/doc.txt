Rein of fire

Horses have once again been made to leap and hurtle through fire by human beings as part of an annual religious festival in the name of Spain's patron saint of animals.

Horses and riders were seen charging through flames several feet high in the streets of Vilanova D'Alcolea, in Castellon, eastern Spain, as part of an annual festival celebrating Saint Antoni.

The saint, canonised more than 790 years ago, is well-loved in Spain, and days-long festivals are held the country in his honour. (Daily Mail)
