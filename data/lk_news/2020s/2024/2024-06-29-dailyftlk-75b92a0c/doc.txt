USCIRF releases latest update on religious freedom in Sri Lanka

The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) yesterday released the latest report on Sri Lanka.

The Sri Lanka Country Update provides an overview of the current religious freedom conditions in Sri Lanka and key observations from USCIRFâ€™s 2023 delegation to the country, such as religiously motivated land disputes, registration challenges, and the use of discriminatory legislation to target and detain religious minorities. It includes a summary of proposed amendments to the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act, the Anti-Terrorism Act, the Online Safety Bill, and the enforcement of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Act.

In its 2024 Annual Report, USCIRF recommended that the US Department of State include Sri Lanka on its Special Watch List for engaging in or allowing severe violations of religious freedom. In May 2024, USCIRF held a hearing on religious freedom in Sri Lanka.

USCIRF is an independent, bipartisan Federal Government entity established by the US Congress to monitor, analyse, and report on religious freedom abroad. USCIRF makes foreign policy recommendations to the President, the Secretary of State, and Congress, intended to deter religious persecution and promote freedom of religion and belief.
