Striking uni non-academic staff to hold talks with UGC

A discussion is scheduled to be held on Monday (July 01) between the University Grants Commission (UGC) and representatives of the Inter-University Trade Union Federation to address the wage issues of university non-academic staff.

K.L.D.G. Richmond, the co-secretary of the Inter-University Trade Union Federation, stated yesterday (28) that the university non-academic employees have decided to continue their trade union action.

“It has been 53 days since the university system has been inoperative. The government has not made any positive intervention to solve the problems so far. The trade unions met yesterday and decided to continue this trade union action. If a proper solution is not found, the trade union action will continue.”
