ECONOMYNEXT â€“ Sri Lankan food products were showcased at the International Green Week in Berlin, a top trade fair in Europe which drew more than 400,000 visitors, with the support of the Delegation of German Industry and Commerce in Sri Lanka (AHK Sri Lanka).

AHK had organized the Sri Lanka Pavilion at the IGW for the fourth year.

Exporters specializing in tea, coconut and coconut-based products, spices, fruit and fruit-related items, and authentic ready-to-eat Sri Lankan food products were represented, AHK Sri Lanka said in a statement.

Apart from showcasing their product ranges to buyers, the exhibitors benefitted from interacting with consumers, observing new developments and offerings from other countries, and thereby broadening their experiences, AHK Sri Lanka said.

Sri Lanka Ambassador to Germany, Varuni Muthukumarana who inaugurated the pavilion on January 19, was quoted as saying that participation in such exhibitions, adherence to international standards, and building strong relationships would help increase Sri Lankan agricultural exports to Europe.

This year 11 Sri Lanka exporters had participated in the IGW up from 5 in 2018. (Colombo/Feb14/2024)
