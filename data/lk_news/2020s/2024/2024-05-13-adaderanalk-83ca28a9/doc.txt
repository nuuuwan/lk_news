SC calls for progress report on probe into Pastor Jerome Fernando

The Supreme Court has instructed the Attorney General to submit a report pertaining to the progress of investigations into Pastor Jerome Fernando, the self-styled ‘prophet’ who came under fire over his controversial comments on other religions.

This order was issued when a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed against Pastor Jerome Fernando was taken up before a three-member Supreme Court judge bench led by Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya today (13).

Several religious leaders had filed this petition seeking an order to prosecute Pastor Jerome Fernando under the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) over his derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures.

Pastor Fernando found himself in hot water after a video of one of his sermons went viral on social media, due to allegations that it included derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures.

Fernando then flew out to Singapore on May 14, 2023, two days before the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court banned his foreign travels.

After months of controversy over his remarks, Fernando returned to the island on November 29.  As per an Appeals Court directive, the CID’s Cyber Crime Investigation Division obtained a statement from the pastor within 48 hours of his arrival on the island.

He was first placed behind bars on remand on December 01, following his arrest by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), a few hours after he arrived at the premises to record a statement for the second consecutive day.

Pastor Fernando was subsequently further remanded until December 27, on the orders of Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court.

The Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court granted bail to Fernando on 03 January 2024. Despite granting bail, the court imposed travel restrictions on Pastor Jerome, prohibiting him from leaving the country, and the strict condition that he refrain from making any such statements in the future that could disturb religious harmony.
