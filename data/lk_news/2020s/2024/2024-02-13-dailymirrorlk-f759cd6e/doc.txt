Government has committed a huge mistake by appointing healthcare workers to hospitals

Colombo, Feb 13 (Daily Mirror) - GovernmentÂ Medical Officers' Forum (GMOF) president Dr. Rukshan Bellana said today that the government has made a significant error by appointing healthcare workers to hospitals.

Addressing the media, he highlighted that healthcare workers used to be involved in tasks such as transporting patients using wheelchairs and trolleys, as well as handling the transportation of blood and urine samples to and from patients.

"In foreign countries, healthcare workers are assisted by private companies in carrying out these activities. Turning these tasks into government services was a significant mistake on the part of the government. Those who engaged in election campaigns and poster campaigns were elected for their satisfaction in these roles," he said.

"Taking all aspects into account, the government has not achieved any financial gains by appointing individuals to these particular roles. Instead, the repercussions are more detrimental to the people than to the government, resulting in a significant loss to the public.

"It is unfair for healthcare workers to seek the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance, which is traditionally provided to doctors. While healthcare workers are eligible to request various allowances, the DAT allowance is considered an exception.

"Therefore, we must oppose the demands put forth by the healthcare workers," said Dr. Bellana and advised them to persist with their strike and stay at home.
