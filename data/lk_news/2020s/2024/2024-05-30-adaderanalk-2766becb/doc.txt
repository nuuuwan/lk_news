Met. Dept. issues ‘red alert’ for strong winds and rough seas

The Department of Meteorology has issued a ‘Red’ alert for strong winds and rough seas for the naval and fishing communities in the Arabian Sea and in the Bay of Bengal.

Very strong winds of 60-70 kmph, accompanied by heavy rainfalls and very rough seas, are expected to continue over the sea areas around the island, the South-west and South-east Arabian Sea, and the South-west Bay of Bengal due to active south-west monsoonal conditions, the department warned.

Furthermore, the department advised the naval and fishing communities not to venture into the sea areas marked in red on the map until further notice. Those already in these regions should return to the coast or move to safer areas immediately.

The general public, along with the fishing and naval communities, are urged to take precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.

Additionally, they are requested to stay attentive to future forecasts issued by the Department of Meteorology.
