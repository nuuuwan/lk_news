Marikkar criticises NPP’s lack of comprehensive economic policy

SJB MP S.M. Marikkar expresses disappointment NPP has not responded to request for Economic Council debate

Says SJB is open to hold leadership debate first only if dates for economic council debate are provided

Stresses people will not accept NPP economic policies which have not been penned down and are limited to rhetoric

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP S.M. Marikkar yesterday said no one in the country will be willing to accept National People’s Power (NPP) party’s economic policies which appear to be limited to rhetoric and have not been penned down as a comprehensive plan.

Speaking at a press briefing, Marikkar emphasised that the primary concern in Sri Lanka is the economic crisis. He noted that the SJB has therefore proposed dates for debates involving both the Economic Councils and Leadership to the NPP. However, he expressed disappointment that the NPP has yet to respond to the request for the Economic Council debate.

“However, the NPP’s response did not address the Economic Council. They assert that they have not yet formulated an economic policy. If they aspire to govern effectively, it is imperative for them to develop a comprehensive economic policy,” he said.

Marikkar noted that while the NPP aims to prioritise the leadership debate, the SJB is open to this arrangement but under the condition that dates for the economic council debate are also provided. “We are not prepared to attend a mere political discussion,” he said
