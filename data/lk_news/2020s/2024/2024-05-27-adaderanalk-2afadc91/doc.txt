Water levels of several rivers on the rise

The Department of Irrigation says that the water levels of several rivers are continuing to rise following heavy rainfall.

The department mentioned that the water levels of the Attanagalu Oya, Kelani, Kalu, Gin and Nilwala rivers are currently on the rise.

The Director of Irrigation (Hydrology & Disaster Management) S. P. C. Sugeeshwara stated that the water levels of the aforesaid rivers are at ‘caution level’ and therefore, residents of low-lying areas near these rivers are advised to remain vigilant.

Meanwhile, four sluice gates of the Deduru Oya reservoir in Kurunegala District have been opened this morning (27) releasing water at a rate of around 7,000 cubic feet per second.

The sluice gates of Kukule Ganga have also been opened and water is being released at a rate of 80 cubic feet per second, which may cause the water level of the Kuda Ganga to rise.

Therefore, residents of the Bulathsinhala Divisional Secretariat are advised to remain cautious about potential flooding.
