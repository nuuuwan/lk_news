Dayasiri says Maithripala unlikely to contest upcoming presidential poll

Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) dissident MP, Dayasiri Jayasekera on Thursday said that it is unlikely that former president Maithripala Sirisena would contest the coming presidential election.

The SLFP Central Committee will meet on 08 January to determine who will be the party’s presidential candidate, he said.

“The party will nominate him but he will not contest. He can’t win,” he said.

Jayasekera said that he is willing to work with a political alliance in the coming elections as he will not receive nominations from the SLFP.

“However, I will not get the membership of another party. There is a lot of crossovers these days because MPs are worried about electability at the coming election,” he said.
