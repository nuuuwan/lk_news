Supreme Court dismisses contempt petition against Diana Gamage

The Supreme Court today (05) dismissed a contempt of court petition filed against former state minister Diana Gamage.

The petition was taken up before a three-member Supreme Court bench comprising Justices Preethi Padman Surasena, Yasantha Kodagoda and Shiran Gunaratne.

However, the court decided to dismiss the petition in a majority decision by the judge bench, Ada Derana reporter said.

The petition, filed by the former chairman of the Weligama Urban Council Rehan Jayawickrema, had accused  Gamage of contempt for the comments made by her during a press conference following the Supreme Court’s judgment disqualifying her from holding the position as a Member of Parliament.
