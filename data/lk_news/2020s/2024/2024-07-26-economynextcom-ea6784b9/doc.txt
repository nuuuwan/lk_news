Sri Lanka evaluating 100 applications to import vehicles for tourism

ECONOMYNEXT â€“ Sri Lanka has received applications to get permits to import around 100 vehicles, Secretary Ministry of Tourism and Lands, Somarathne Vidanapathirana said.

The Cabinet approved the import of vans and buses to help improve the vehicle stock to transport tourists, relaxing a vehicle import ban imposed during currency crisis triggered by aggressive macro-economic policy involving rate and tax cuts.

Some of the vehicles in the sector are 10 to 15 years old, Vidanapathirana, told reporters in Colombo on July 25.

Around 100 applications from eligible tourism operators are now being evaluated, he said.

Already 10 permits have been given to those who met the criteria. (Colombo/July26/2024)
