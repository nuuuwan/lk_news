Chinese medical ship to call on Sri Lanka for health system backing

ECONOMYNEXT – A Chinese medical will arrive in Sri Lanka from December 21-28 to back the island nation’s healthcare system, Cabinet Spokesman and Health Minister Nalinda Jayatissa said on Thursday (19).

From 21-28, a medical ship, with 200 crew, is coming to Sri Lanka and they are supporting our health system from the Chinese vessel,” Jayatissa told reporters

“We don’t have any objection to that,” he said with the context of the island nation’s one-year ban on foreign research vessels.

The Cabinet Spokesman in the same media briefing said the ban, imposed by the previous government, has been now relaxed and the government will consider requests by foreign research vessels on a case by case basis. (Colombo/December 19/2024)
