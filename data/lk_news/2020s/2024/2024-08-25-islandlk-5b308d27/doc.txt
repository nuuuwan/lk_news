CEAT Kelani Holdings supports schoolchildren in Monaragala with essential supplies

School children from a rubber farming community in Sri Lanka’s Monaragala District have recently benefited from a social responsibility initiative by CEAT Kelani Holdings, a major domestic consumer of the country’s natural rubber. The company provided 120 students from the Vidyartha Maha Vidyalaya in Nakkala with school bags, shoes, and exercise books, continuing its support for key stakeholder groups.

CEAT Kelani Holdings, which produces half of Sri Lanka’s pneumatic tyres, sources all its natural rubber from local producers who support around 10,000 cultivating families. Earlier this year, the company also distributed school supplies to students at schools in Matugama, Kuruwita, and Elpitiya.

CEAT Kelani’s Chief Operating Officer, Shamal Gunawardene, explained that the initiative is driven by the importance of rubber cultivators to their supply chain. He emphasized that supporting the education of their children not only aids the cultivators’ aspirations but also fulfills a broader social responsibility.
