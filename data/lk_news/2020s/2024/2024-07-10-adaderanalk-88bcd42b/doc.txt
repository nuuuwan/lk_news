Piyumi Hansamali files petition seeking to halt CID probe

Actress Piyumi Hansamali has filed a petition with the Court of Appeal seeking a writ order to suspend the investigations being carried out against her by the Illegal Assets Investigations Division of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).

The petition has named several officials including the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and the Director of the CID as respondents.

Hansamali, who highlights in her petition that the Illegal Assets Investigations Division of the CID has launched an investigation against her, alleges that the manner in which the investigation is carried out is not justified and that it has cause severe prejudice to her.

Accordingly, the petitioner requests the Court of Appeals to call and examine the case file against her being heard before the Colombo Magistrate’s Court and to issue a writ order to suspend the investigations being carried out by the CID’s Illegal Assets Investigations Division.
