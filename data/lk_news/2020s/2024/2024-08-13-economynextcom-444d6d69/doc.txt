Sri Lanka Yala rice harvest projected at 1.77mn tonnes

ECONOMYNEXT â€“ Sri Lanka is expecting a rice harvest of at least 1.771 million metric tonnes in the Yala minor agricultural season that is coming to an end, a projection by the Department of Agriculture shows.

The projection is made based on 477,299 hectares of rice cultivated up the end of June 2024, which was 1 percent lower than last year.

About 88 percent of the Yala season target of 540,627 hactare completed by June with some areas in Kurunegala, Puttalam, Gampaha, Kalutara, Galle and Matara remaining to cultivated.

In the 2023, Yala season, which was also a good year, 1.817 million metric tonnes of rice was harvested with 505,076 hectares cultivated and 491,672 harvested.

The Maha cropping season, which brings most of the rice crop, depends on inter-monsoon rains over which there are some concerns.   (Colombo/Aug12/2024)
