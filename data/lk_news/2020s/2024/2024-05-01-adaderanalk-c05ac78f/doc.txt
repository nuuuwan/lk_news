Vehicle importers demand proper regulatory framework for vehicle imports

The Vehicle Importers’ Association insists on the necessity of a proper regulatory framework for vehicle imports in Sri Lanka.

President of the association Indika Sampath Merinchige emphasized the need for the government to establish a committee inclusive of their association’s representatives to make decisions on this matter.

“When importing vehicles to Sri Lanka in the past few years, specifically in 2017, 2018, and 2019, 85% of the vehicles imported were used vehicles with only 15% new vehicles were imported. Out of that, 95% of the vehicles were sourced from Japan”, he added.

“In the future, it is imperative to prioritize the preferences of the people when importing vehicles. If the agents prioritize matters that are not aligned with the requirements of the people, there will likely be a decline in demand”, Merinchige said.
