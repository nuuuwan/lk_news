KSPA Packaging, an Anunine Holdings company, the nation’s leading export packaging provider and manufacturer, has achieved a significant milestone recently, by being awarded the Carbon Neutral Certification, which was certified by the Sri Lanka Climate Fund - under the Ministry of Environment of Sri Lanka.

"Our journey towards carbon neutrality and sustainability is a testament to our unwavering commitment to environmental stewardship and innovation, as leaders in the packaging industry.

We recognize the importance of minimizing our environmental impact and are dedicated to driving positive change,” stated Anunine Holdings Chairman Deshamanya Anurath Abeyratne.

Further elaborating on this achievement, KSPA Packaging CEO Nalin Anthony added: “Our intention is to pass on the benefits of this achievement to our esteemed clients across the export sector of Sri Lanka; improving their environmental footprint and value proposition in the international market.”

With a legacy spanning 30 years of continuous development, improvement and expansion, KSPA Packaging proudly asserts its position as the pioneering packaging company in Sri Lanka. Distinguished as the sole entity combining Corrugated & Polythene under one roof, they stand as the most sustainable and export-oriented company with BOI status and is a leading FOREX earning entity in Anunine Holdings and in the country, contributing significantly to the Sri Lankan economy.

On a momentous day in 2007, Anunine Holdings Chairman Deshamanya Anurath Abeyratne acquired the KSPA Accessories from the Accessory Corporation - at the time the No. 1 Hanger company in the world. The company became a part of the group. KSPA Accessories became the licensee of Uniplast in 2013, a hanger company from the USA, that offers design to deliver hanging solutions to leading American clothing brands and retailers like Nike, Calvin Klein, Puma, Hugo Boss, TATA, PVH, JC Penney and Haddad. The company offers its garment hanging solutions under the Uniplast brand to European buyers as well.

KSPA Accessories, another subsidiary of Anunine Holdings owns the second largest hanger manufacturing facility in Sri Lanka. The company is the leader in providing customized and sustainable hanging solutions. The company also makes non-hanging products like thread cones, dye-spools and electric switches for overseas clientele, repositioning the company as the most ‘sustainable injection moulding’ company in Sri Lanka.

The company currently uses 65% recycled material across products, aiming for 100% in the near future, in line with its dedication to sustainable practices. With 0.6MW solar energy installations in progress, the facility will be powered by solar power very soon. The company actively explores numerous biodegradable and compostable materials to make the company more impactful to the environment in which it operates.

The company’s clientele comprises the country's biggest apparel manufacturing giants, and the company's in-house mould making capability is intended to offer faster, effective end-to-end garment hanging solutions.

Owning a state-of-the-art facility spanning 320,000 square feet, equipped with cutting-edge machinery, KSPA Group implements a production strategy focused on high productivity and efficiency. With an impressive top-line figure, they produce over 35 million cartons and 30 million poly bags annually.

“Central to our commitment to sustainability is our recent achievement of carbon neutrality, certified under ISO 14064-1. Beyond mere neutrality, we have earned recognition as a carbon-neutral company through the collective efforts of all our SBU teams within the group. Operating under the rigorous standards of ISO 14001:2015 for environmental management and ISO 9001:2015 for process management, we ensure that sustainability is deeply ingrained in our operations. Moreover, our dedication to environmental preservation extends to our contributions to combating deforestation, evidenced by our Forest Stewardship Council Chain of Custody (FSC COC) certification. By sourcing papers exclusively from FSC-certified mills, we actively participate in the preservation of green spaces,” stated Anunine Holdings Sustainability Analyst Sithara Sewwandi.

Further emphasizing our commitment to sustainability, we prioritise the use of recycled materials, with a significant portion of our paper combinations comprising recycled Test and Medium liners. Additionally, our certification under GRS V4 for recycled polythene underscores our dedication to managing post-industrial waste responsibly through employing blockchain technology to ensure transparency and traceability.

In our pursuit of sustainable practices, we have also prioritized food-grade compliance through our adherence to FSSC 22000 V5.1 standard. This certification ensures that our products are free from contamination and adhere to stringent safety standards.

Recognising the urgent need to address plastic pollution, we offer a range of biodegradable and compostable packaging options, providing environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional materials. Through initiatives like our close-looped process with the KSPA Embilipitiya paper mill, we ensure that waste is transformed into a valuable resource, contributing to both environmental and economic sustainability.

KSPA proudly leads the charge towards energy sustainability, with almost 70% of their roofs covered by solar panels, generating around 2.9MW of renewable energy. Moreover, their boilers are powered by biomass, further reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.

In alignment with their commitment to ethical business practices, KSPA is compliant with SEDEX-SMETA standards, ensuring the maintenance of labor standards, health and safety protocols, and environmental ethics while continuously engaging in impactful CSR projects for the community.

KSPA firmly believes that sustainability and profitability are not mutually exclusive. By prioritising environmental responsibility and embracing innovation, they are forging a path towards an exemplary sustainable future for generations to come.
