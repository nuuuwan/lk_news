Constitutional Council didn’t approve IGP’s appointment – Sajith

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa claims that the Constitutional Council (CC) did not approve the appointment of Deshabandu Tennakoon as the new Inspector General of Police (IGP) and charged that the country’s Constitution is being blatantly violated for the second time.

In a post on ‘X’, formerly known as Twitter, he said that during the meeting of the Constitutional Council, four members had voted in favour of Tennakoon as the new IGP, two voted against it while the other 02 had abstained.

He added that at least 05 votes are required for a decision and that the Speaker has a casting vote only in case of a tie.

“4/2 is not a tie! Constitution is being blatantly violated for the second time. Shame on you speaker!” he tweeted.

The President’s Media Divion confirmed that Senior DIG and Acting IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon was appointed as the 36th IGP of Sri Lanka on Monday (26).

This appointment, in compliance with the stipulations outlined in Articles 41C.(1) and 61E.(b) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, has been made pursuant to the authority vested on President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the PMD said.
