The Sri Lanka India Society (SLIS) organized a celebratory dinner to mark the 76th Independence Day of Sri Lanka and the 75th Republic Day of India, with President Ranil Wickremesinghe and High Commissioner of Sri Lanka to India Santosh Jha as guests of honor.

Notable attendees included dignitaries, diplomats, and society members, gathering to commemorate the occasion at the Taj Samudra Hotel in Colombo.

President Wickremesinghe highlighted the society's 75th anniversary and emphasized the cultural and religious ties between the two nations, urging a focus on enhancing trade and economic relations.

SLIS President Kishore Reddy echoed the sentiment, emphasizing the deep cultural and interpersonal bonds between India and Sri Lanka, and expressing gratitude for India's continued assistance. Reddy concluded with a toast to the enduring friendship and partnership between the two countries, wishing for happiness, peace, and prosperity.

Among esteemed guests including His Excellency President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Jha underscored the profound historical and strategic partnership shared between the two nations.

In his address, Jha celebrated the significant milestone of the 75th anniversary of the Sri Lanka-India Society, acknowledging its pivotal role in fostering enduring ties between the peoples of India and Sri Lanka. Drawing on India's "neighbourhood first" policy and the SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) strategy, Jha emphasized the foundational principles guiding India's engagement with Sri Lanka.

“In other words, for both our countries, there cannot be any relationship that can have higher stakes, and therefore a deeper commitment. As our External Affairs Minister Dr. Jaishankar stated in March 2023, and I quote, “Blood is thicker than water”. This is what makes our relations uniquely fraternal, special, and unlike any other we have with other countries,” High Commissioner Jha said.

Highlighting the multidimensional nature of India-Sri Lanka relations, Jha outlined key areas of collaboration, including infrastructure development, economic engagement, energy security, cultural exchange, and tourism promotion. Notably, he underscored the importance of connectivity initiatives such as the India-Sri Lanka Land Connectivity Corridor, poised to transform bilateral relations and usher in a new era of growth and prosperity.

Jha also underscored India's commitment to supporting Sri Lanka's development aspirations through extensive development cooperation projects spanning railways, housing, renewable energy, agriculture, and education. Additionally, he reiterated India's role as Sri Lanka's largest trade partner and investor, emphasizing ongoing efforts to expand economic cooperation through initiatives like the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA).

Security and defense cooperation emerged as critical components of the bilateral relationship, with Jha highlighting joint exercises, equipment assistance, and India's role as a reliable partner in times of crisis. He stressed the interconnectedness of economic well-being and security stability, emphasizing the importance of regional collaboration in maintaining peace and prosperity.

In closing, Jha expressed confidence in the future trajectory of India-Sri Lanka relations, buoyed by mutual trust, shared values, and the collective resolve to achieve common goals. He extended gratitude to the Sri Lanka-India Society for its invaluable contribution to strengthening bilateral ties and reaffirmed India's unwavering commitment to furthering the age-old friendship between the two nations.

The Sri Lanka-India Society Gala served as a testament to the enduring bond between India and Sri Lanka, signaling a promising outlook for enhanced cooperation and collaboration in the years ahead.
