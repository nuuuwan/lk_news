Sri Lanka plantation companies benefitted from weak rupee, labourers did not: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) benefitted from the weakening of the rupee and saw export gains, but the benefits did not go to the workers, Minister of Estate Infrastructure Jeevan Thondaman has said.

“Even through the economic crisis, RPCs have benefitted from the weakening of the Rupee that gave them an over 80% increase in Rupee revenue in 2023 vs 2021,” Thondaman said on X (twitter).

“When the real value of daily worker wages plummeted from around 5 USD to 2.7 USD and inflation plunged over half the workers to below the poverty line, RPCs continued to reap the benefits of their hard labour.”

“While export revenues grew exponentially, none of those benefits went to the workers, who are the backbone of the industry.”

The minister said he was hopeful of an announcement favourable to the workers from RPCs who have said that they will be responding to the wage hike for plantation workers today (6).

“This is not a situation that the Government alone can fix. RPCs must take the responsibility and stop what is by all means a gross exploitation of labour.” (Colombo/May6/2024)
