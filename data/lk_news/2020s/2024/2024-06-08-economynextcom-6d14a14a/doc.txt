Sri Lanka, Maldives to increase ties in trade, tourism, energy

ECONOMYNEXT – The Maldives was keen to expand relations with Sri Lanka through an investment protection treaty and double tax avoidance agreement, its visiting Minister of Foreign Affairs Moosa Zameer has said.

Zameer met Sri Lankan officials including Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena to discuss strengthening existing ties, and exploring new avenues of cooperation, particularly on trade, investment, education and culture.

“The proposed bilateral treaties and Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) would help to further strengthen economic cooperation between Maldives and Sri Lanka,” a statement by the PM’s office said.

“It is proposed to sign a Investment Protection Treaty, Double Tax Avoidance Agreement and to facilitate remittances by Sri Lankans employed in the Maldives who receive payment in Maldives currency and to facilitate Maldivian students and medical tourists to make payments in Sri Lanka.”

Zameer asked that education opportunities for more Maldives students be facilitated. “Like many Maldivians, I also studied in Sri Lanka,” he said.

He said the Maldives wants to recruit Sri Lankan teachers and doctors and asked the prime minister to consider a government-to-government agreement for this.

However, Sri Lanka is facing shortages of teachers and doctors after many professionals left the country after its economic crisis.

Prime Minister Gunawardena asked the Maldives government to provide free passage to ‘genuine’ fishermen from Sri Lanka.

The Maldives uses drones to monitor vessel movements and Zameer said it would ensure safe passage for Sri Lankan fishing vessels.

Cooperation in tourism and the energy sector, especially solar and wind power, were also discussed.

Sri Lanka this week passed a new Electricity Bill which aims to facilitate more private sector investment in the energy sector, particularly wind and solar, in order to raise the renewable energy component of its power generation mix.

While here, Zameer met with President Ranil Wickremesighe, Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry and State Minister Tharaka Balasuriya, the Sri Lanka business community, the Sri Lanka-Maldives Business Council, the Opposition leader and his party members, and Minister of Public security Tiran Alles.

I expressed my gratitude to the Minister for his commitment to resolving the visa challenges that the Maldivians face due to the recent changes to Sri Lanka’s visa policy,” Zameer said on social media platform X (twitter).
