Zone24x7 and STEMUP Educational Foundation to empower Sri Lankan students with knowledge of AI

Zone24x7, a leading provider of end-to-end technology consulting and engineering solutions, has entered into a strategic partnership with STEMUP Educational Foundation to help drive knowledge about cutting-edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, and many others among Sri Lankan students through the ground-breaking program ‘AI for Kids’.

AI is rapidly advancing and becoming increasingly integrated into various industries across the globe. Introducing children early to AI education ensures they are prepared for the technology-driven future and have the skills required for upcoming careers. ‘AI for Kids’ is a long-term program by Zone24x7 and STEMUP to educate children about the fascinating world of AI and is designed to equip teachers/educators, school children, and STEMUP volunteers with the necessary knowledge and understanding of the field of AI. The program will eventually help children grow up with these new technologies and provide them with the best platform to succeed in domains related to them as they embark on their careers in the future.

AI education offers children numerous benefits and opportunities for their learning and development. It encourages them to think critically, analyze information, and solve problems. It promotes computational thinking, which involves approaching problems in a structured and algorithmic way.
