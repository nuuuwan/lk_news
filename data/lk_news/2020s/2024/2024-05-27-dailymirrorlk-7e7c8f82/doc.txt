Lalkantha trying to prevent Anura’s success: Marikar

Colombo, May27 (Daily Mirror) - National People’s Power (NPP) member K.D. Lalkantha trying to prevent his party from coming into power, SJB MP S.M. Marikar said today.

"Lalkantha is trying to prevent his leader  leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake as he is aware that Dissanayake is unable to run a government effectively," Marikar  told a media conference.

“Lalkantha is well aware that his leader will make a mess of everything if  he comes to power. This is why he is making remarks which are disadvantageous to the NPP and trying to prevent Dissanayake from coming into power,” Marikar said.

He said Dissanayake has proved his inability to write a condolence message on the sudden demise of Iranian President Ebarhim Raisi.

“All political party leaders went to the Iranian Embassy to express their condolences. All political parties wrote messages in the condolence book. However Dissanayake copied something from his phone to the condolence book. This is probably something which someone else wrote and sent to him. Can such a person run the country,” MP Marikar questioned.
