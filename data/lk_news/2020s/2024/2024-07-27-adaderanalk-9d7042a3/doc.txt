Ward Place murder: Youth stabbed by drug addicts during mobile phone robbery?

More details have been revealed regarding the incident where a man was found stabbed to death with sharp weapons inside a parked three-wheeler at Ward Place in Colombo on July 23, following the interrogation of the arrested suspects.

Two suspects were arrested by the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) in connection with the incident. The suspects were apprehended following an extensive investigation by several police units, including the Organized Crime Investigation Unit of the CCD.

The breakthrough came through the analysis of CCTV footage, which led officers to arrest the suspects on July 26, during a search operation at Samagi Mawatha, Grandpass.

The suspects, aged 35 and 48, are residents of Gonawila and Grandpass, according to police.

Upon their arrest, authorities found 30 grams and 200 milligrams of crystal methamphetamine, commonly known as ‘Ice’, in their possession.

Interrogations revealed that the suspects targeted the three-wheeler driver with the intention of stealing his mobile phone to fund their drug addiction.

On the morning of July 23, they had arrived at Ward Place in a stolen three-wheeler from the Sapugaskanda area. After spotting the victim on a phone call, they decided to rob him. During the subsequent altercation, one suspect had stabbed the driver in the chest with a sharp weapon.

Following the attack, the driver fell onto the road, but the suspects had placed him back in the three-wheeler before fleeing with his mobile phone. The stolen phone was later pawned for Rs. 4,000, which was used to purchase the ‘Ice’ drugs.

Police have recovered both the weapon used in the attack and the stolen three-wheeler. Authorities are now seeking a third suspect believed to be involved in the crime.
