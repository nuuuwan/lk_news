Donâ€™t send children to schools merely to pass exams: Minister

Colombo, March 4 (Daily Mirror) - Children should not be sent to schools to make them merely pass exams by creating a competitive environment as the target of education is to equip children with knowledge and attitudes as well as skills, Education Minister Susil Premajayantha said.

Addressing the media, he said the proposed educational reforms show the measurement of skills acquired by the child in practical activities.

He made these comments while joining the national programme held today at Dharmashoka Vidyalaya, Maharagama to introduce the Activity Based Oral English (ABOE) programme to schools for children who will enter Grade 1 in 2024.
