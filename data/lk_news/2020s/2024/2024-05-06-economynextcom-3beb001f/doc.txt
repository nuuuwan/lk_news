No tender needed for Sri Lanka visa deal, nobody can compete against VFS: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s controversial visa deal which led to doubling of fees with multiple charges, was awarded without a tender and nobody could compete against the VFS company in any case, Public Security Minister Tiran Alles said.

Many things are done without tender in Sri Lanka and the visa deal was a proposal, he said.

“There are several [procurement] methods in Sri Lanka,” Minister Alles explained to reporters Monday, amid brewing controversy over the visa deal which had led to a doubling of visa costs to around 100 dollar per tourist.

“There is no need to call tenders for this type of thing. This is a proposal. There is a method of studying proposals. Many things (orner-tharam-deval) are done that way.”

The correct way to do the deal was when a company made a proposal, appoint a committee to study it and go back to cabinet, he explained.

Companies named GBS Technology Services and IVS Global – FZCO had initially made the proposal with VFS VF Worldwide Holdings Ltd coming in as the technology partner, based on information available so far.

“Just think about this, because I say it,” Minister Alles said. “If we called tenders who is there to tender for this and compete against VFS?

“We went to cabinet. Committees were appointed. It was studied. Against went to cabinet. That was the correct process that was done.”

The company had said they were investing 200 million dollars in equipment, therefore there had to be a period to recover it.

There must be a clause to end the contract if they broke clauses, otherwise the Attorney General would not have approved the contract, Minister Alles said.

The 18.50 charge was lower than the service fee charged by other countries, he said. (Colombo/May06/2024)
