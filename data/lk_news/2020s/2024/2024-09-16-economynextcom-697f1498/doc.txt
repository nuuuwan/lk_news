Sri Lanka gazettes tea, rubber wages at Rs1,350 with Rs50 over kilo rate

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s wage board has mandated daily wages for tea and rubber workers effective from September 10, according to a gazette notice.

The minimum daily wage is 1,350 rupees for a ‘norm’ of each estate, and there will be a 50 rupee payment for each kilo plucked above the ‘norm’.

The norm is the usual leaf that can be plucked for a field. Some fields which are in shadow of mountains or in areas that get lower rainfall have lower ‘norms’.

The new formula was mutually agreed with plantations companies, industry sources said.

An earlier model which mandated a 1,700 rupee minimum wage was resisted by plantations companies, who said it will result in lower volumes of tea being plucked.

Sri Lanka’s plantations workers and other wage earners found their salaries purchasing power destroyed after macroeconomists in the central bank and Treasury cut its policy rate by printing large volumes of money permanently depreciated the currency.

Sri Lanka’s small holders are plucking larger volumes of tea from smaller areas due to a payment formula based on plucking, plantations have said.

Plantations have used similar formulas on so-called ‘revenue share models’ where plots of land are allocated to a plucker. (Colombo/Aug16/2024)
