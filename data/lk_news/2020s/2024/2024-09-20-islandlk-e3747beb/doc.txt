Serendib Horticulture Technologies marks 25 years of global plant export excellence

Serendib Horticulture Technologies Pvt Ltd recently celebrated 25 years in the export business. The Deputy Head of Mission at the embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to Sri Lanka and Maldives Iwan Rutjens was the Chief Guest with several academics in the agriculture and floriculture sectors present with other horticulture experts and industry personnel and public sector officials.

Serendib Horticulture Technologies Pvt Ltd, first formed in 1999, has been in the business of exporting plants to countries around the world for 25 years. This is not a small task for an SME company to survive and grow in this very competitive and challenging environment. At present, it is one of the leading companies in the business of exporting plants in Sri Lanka.

When the company started in 1999, the main export products were rooted plants. These plants were sourced through the company’s own mother plants and also through plant suppliers. Tissue culture propagated plants took second place where the exports were only around 300,000 plants. Over the next few years the company expanded its markets in Holland, USA, Australia, Denmark, Korea, Japan, Rwanda, Iran, Canada, Qatar and Pakistan.

Under the leadership of Dilip de Silva, chairman/ CEO, the company started expanding the plant tissue culture production due to the niche market that was present 15 years ago. Production in the lab increased to nearly 2.5 million plants per year.
