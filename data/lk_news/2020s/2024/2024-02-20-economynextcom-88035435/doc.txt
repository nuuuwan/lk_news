Sri Lanka to allow English as court language in selected courts

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will allow court proceedings to be conducted in English in selected courts, to expedite court proceedings, the cabinet spokesman has said.

Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe proposed that “Certain courts be allowed to conduct proceedings in English,” Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at a press briefing to announce the week’s Cabinet decisions, on Tuesday (20).

“Especially courts that deal with international trade or business related disputes, commercial disputes.”

Court proceedings and documents are in Sinhala, the State language. “There is a delay when it comes to translating Sinhala documents into English and that has affected the country’s position in the Ease of Doing Business Index,” Gunawardena said. As of 2021, Sri Lanka ranks 99 in the index. (Colombo/Feb20/2024)
