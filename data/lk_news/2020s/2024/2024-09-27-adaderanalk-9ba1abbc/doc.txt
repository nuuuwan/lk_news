Heavy showers above 100mm expected; Advisory for severe lightning

The Meteorology Department says showery conditions are expected to enhance during the next few days starting today (27), due to the low-level atmospheric disturbance in the vicinity of Sri Lanka.

Showers or thundershowers will occur over most places of the Island during the afternoon or night, it said.

Heavy showers above 100 mm can be expected at some places in Central and Sabaragamuwa provinces and in Kaluthara, Galle and Matara districts.

Showers or thundershowers will occur in Southern Province and in Batticaloa and Ampara districts during the morning too.

Meanwhile, the Meteorology Department has also issued an advisory for severe lightning for several provinces.

Thundershowers accompanied by severe lightning are likely to occur at several places in North, North-Central, Central, Uva, and Eastern provinces, it said.

There may be temporary localized strong winds during thundershowers. The general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by lightning activity
