First ever solar tunnel dryer technology in Sri Lanka

Colombo, March 25 (Daily Mirror) - The first ever Solar Tunnel Dryer technology, which was introduced to dry grain seeds including maize, paddy, green gram, cow peas, sesame, finger millet and black seed was successful, the Agriculture Ministry said.

This new solar-powered system was inaugurated recently at Nelukkulam in Vavuniya, and the new seed drying system was inaugurated by Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.

The entire warehouse is covered with glass so that natural sunlight and solar radiation are continuously available. Even at night, the optimum temperature required for drying the seeds can be obtained by using solar energy without any cost. Under this method, the seeds are completely protected from solar ultraviolet rays.

Addressing the event, Director of the Agriculture Sector Modernization Project, Dr. Rohan Wijekoon said the Solar Tunnel Dryer technology is being introduced to Sri Lanka for the first time, and the experiments have been 100 percent successful so far.
