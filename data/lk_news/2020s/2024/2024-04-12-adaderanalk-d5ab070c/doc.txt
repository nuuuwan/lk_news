Govt. to distribute Avurudu gifts to children at 336 child development centers

The distribution of annual gift parcels to children under the care of 336 child development centers throughout the country, in line with President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s initiative, is scheduled to take place tomorrow (13).

Coordinated by the Office of the President, with support from the Office of the Chief of Defence Staff and Sri Lanka Army, the distribution aims to bring joy to over 10,000 children, the President’s Media Division (PMD) said.

Regardless of their circumstances, these centers across various provinces, including the Central, Eastern, Northern, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, Uva and Western, will ensure that every child feels included and valued, extending a sense of family to them.

The program is sponsored by Ceylon Biscuits Limited (CBL), facilitating the delivery of these much-awaited parcels to children nationwide, the PMD added.
