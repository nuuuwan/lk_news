Former MP Mervyn Silva protests against Online Safety Bill

A group including former Parliamentarian Mervyn Silva was seen carrying a false coffin into the Borella Cemetery on Sunday (04 Feb.), in protest against the Online Safety Bill.

Security personnel at the entrance of the cemetery had reportedly attempted to prevent the group from entering into the premises.

Despite their attempt, however, the group had entered the premises and staged a protest against the highly controversial Online Safety Bill, which came into effect earlier this month.

The legislation which seeks to regulate online content was passed in Parliament, with amendments, on 24 January, amidst objections from opposition politicians and activists who allege the new law will muzzle free speech.

The controversial Bill garnered not only the attention of local activists and organisations, but also that of diplomats and large international organisations, claiming that the Bill had numerous problematic aspects.

The Sri Lankan government says the Online Safety Bill, published in the government gazette on 18 September, aims to ban online communication of certain statements in the country, prevent the use of online accounts – both authentic and inauthentic – for the use of prohibited purposes, to suppress the financing and other support of communication of false statements and other related matters.
