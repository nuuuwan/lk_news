Sri Lanka planning patient bill of rights: Minister

ECONOMYNET – A patient rights charter will be introduced to ensure the safety of patients admitted to hospitals, amid complaints that patients are not heard, Health and Industry Minister Dr Ramesh Pathirana has said.

“The fact that the medical and health staff sometimes do not listen to the patient is an opinion shared by patients all over the world, and in this regard, the Ministry of Health received nearly 700 complaints last year,” Pathirana was quoted in a statement.

“According to reports from many countries of the world, one out of 7 patients who are admitted to hospital face at least some problem in the hospital, and it is a global situation.”

The world’s opinion is that the harmony of the health staff with the patients should be improved, the minister told staff of the Wathupitiwala Hospital in Gampaha during an observation visit.

The Minister said a charter on the rights of patients will be presented in the Parliament’s Sectoral Oversight Committee and that there is a possibility that it will become a law in the future. (Colombo/May16/2024)
