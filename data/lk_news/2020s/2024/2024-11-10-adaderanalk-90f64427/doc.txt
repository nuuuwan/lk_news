The Disaster Management Center (DMC) announced that a dedicated program is in place to manage potential disaster situations during the upcoming parliamentary election period.

Director of the DMC Pradeep Kodippili said a special unit will be set up specifically for this purpose, with operations set to commence on November 12.
