Sri Lanka’s Planters’ Association marks 170 years

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Planters’ Association which represents the managers of the island’s commercial farms growing tea, rubber, coconut and palm oil, is marking 170 years this year.

Established in 1854, the PA being one of the oldest institutions in the country, has continuously represented and safeguarded the interests of the plantations.

As one of Sri Lanka’s largest foreign exchange earners, the plantation industry, primarily known for Pure Ceylon Tea, also includes other key crops such as rubber, coconut, spices, and palm oil. The sector provides employment to approximately 125,000 individuals in Regional Plantations.

The PA will host its 170th annual general meeting on Saturday (14) at 7 pm at the Galadari Hotel, Colombo, and appoint the Chairman and Executive Committee for 2024/2025.

Since privatization in 1992, the plantation industry has undergone transformations, with RPCs moving into crop diversification.

The privatized management has increased the industry’s operational efficiency, reducing the government’s financial burden while contributing to the economy. The Association plans to enhance productivity and diversification in future, it said in a statement. (Colombo/Sep12/2024)
