Sri Lanka discussing program targets with IMF staff mission

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is discussing program targets and commitment with a visiting International Monetary Fund staff mission in Colombo an official said.

“It is kind of a fact finding or technical mission,” IMF’s Director of Communications, Julie Kozack told reporters in Washington Thursday.

“And the goal of this mission is to discuss recent developments and to follow up on program targets and commitments.

Sri Lanka is restructuring its debt after the country defaulted in peacetime after triggering serial currency crises in the course of operating a modified inflation targeting regime without clean float (flexible inflation targeting) and cutting rates with inflationary domestic operations for growth (targeting potential output).

“And the next steps on the debt restructuring are to conclude the negotiations with external commercial creditors and to implement agreements with official creditors.”
