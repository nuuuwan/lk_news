Sri Lanka among ten countries mostly affected by climate change

Colombo, March 22 (Daily Mirror) -  Sri Lanka is among the ten countries which are mostly affected by climate change, the first session of the Sri Lanka Climate Parliament revealed today.

The disclosure was made by Climate Parliament Chairman Eran Wickramaratne and Senior Presidential advisor Ruwan Wijewardene.

MP Wickremesratne stressed that the Sri Lanka Climate Parliament will work with internal bodies and other nations to minimize the effect of climate change.

“We intend to work with UNDP, UNDIO and will also work in line with the government’s road map for hydrogen,” he said.

Rwan Wijewardene also said that climate change will account for one percent loss of Sri Lanka’s GDP by 2050.

“Sri Lanka’s agriculture sector is slated to lose billions of dollars due to climate change,” he added.

“The government has adopted three strategies to face the situation. One is the tropical belt initiative which is a body made of nations located near the equator. The second is the climate justice initiative where focus is made on environment friendly development projects such as renewable energy initiative. The third is the international climate university,” he said.
