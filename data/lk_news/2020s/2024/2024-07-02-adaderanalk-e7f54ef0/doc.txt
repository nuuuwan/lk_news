Appeals Court decision on Keheliya’s petition fixed for Aug. 01

This order was issued by the two-member Appeals Court bench comprising President of the Court of Appeal Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Shashi Mahendran following an extensive consideration of the facts presented related to the petition today (02).

Accordingly, the judge bench also ordered the related parties to file written submissions related to the case, if any, before July 15, 2024.

When this petition was taken up for consideration today, President’s Counsel Chandaka Jayasundara, who appeared for the Sri Lanka Bar Association (BASL), pointed out that the former Health Minister was involved from the beginning to the end of the process of purchasing the drugs in question, which is the basis of this case.

The President’s Counsel further mentioned that it is not possible to purchase such medicines without the knowledge of the then health minister.

However, appearing for Rambukwella President’s Counsel Faisz Mustapha stated before the court that his client was involved in the process of purchasing these medicines based on the instructions received from the officials of his ministry and he had no personal involvement in it.

Following the consideration of all facts presented, the court ordered the relevant decision to be delivered on August 01, 2024.
