Sri Lanka’s Marxist leader secures 42.3% of votes at presidency; tipped to win after second count

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanak’s Marxist presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayaka topped the vote list by securing 5.6 million votes or 42.3 percent in the presidential election concluded on Saturday with a lead of 9.55 percent from the second ranked Sajith Premadasa, election results showed.

“This is not the final results. We are in the process of counting preferential votes. After that we will declare the winner,” Saman Sri Ratnayake, the Commissioner General of Election said after the conclusion of the first round counting.

The winner will be the ninth president of the island nation and rule the country for next five years.

Opposition leader Premadasa secured 4.36 million votes or 32.8 percent of the total polled while incumbent leader Ranil Wickremesinghe polled only 2.3 million votes or 17.3 percent.

The Election Commission is compelled to go for the preferential vote counting as per election laws after no candidate obtained simple majority. Analysts said Dissanayaka has high probability of winning after the preferential vote counting citing a wide margin with the second ranked Premadasa.

President Wickremesinghe was eliminated in the first round after he failed to become within the top two in the vote list. (Colombo/September 22/2024)
