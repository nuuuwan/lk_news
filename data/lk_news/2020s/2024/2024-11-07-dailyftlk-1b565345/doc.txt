China extends fabric grant for 2025 school uniforms

The People’s Republic of China has pledged 11.82 million meters of fabric to be distributed as uniform materials for students across the country for the coming school year.

The Cabinet of Ministers at their meeting on Monday has approved this generous grant from the Chinese Government to supply school uniforms in 2025.

Addressing the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday, Cabinet Spokesman Minister Vijitha Herath said the fabric grant is valued at over Rs. 5.2 billion.

The Sri Lanka Textile and Garment Institute (SLITA) conducted thorough testing on fabric samples provided to the Education Ministry and confirmed the material’s suitability for school uniforms.

“The uniforms for both school and Piriven (monastic) education will be distributed in two stages – the first batch by the end of this month and the second in the following month, with fabric pre-cut to specified sizes for distribution,” he added.
