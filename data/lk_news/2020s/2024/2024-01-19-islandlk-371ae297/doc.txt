Vogue Jewellers unveils exclusive investment path

In Sri Lanka, one asset class in particular has stood the test of time – and that is gold. Its enduring appeal as a symbol of wealth and stability transcends centuries, making it a timeless choice for anyone looking to invest with the future in mind. Vogue Jewellers, recognizing the intrinsic value of gold, introduces an exclusive opportunity for all Sri Lankans with its upcoming OG (Old Gold) promotion in January 2024.

From the 16th to the 21st of January 2024, Vogue Jewellers invites you to embark on a future-facing journey towards expanding your wealth by exchanging your old gold jewellery for new gold. Crafted from 22 gold and weighing just over a quarter of an ounce, these newly crafted (gold bullion) pieces represent not only a valuable investment but also serve as tangible items of history that can be passed on as a timeless legacy.

Explaining the significance of this golden opportunity, Anura Hemachandra, Managing Director of Vogue Jewellers explained, “Understanding that many Sri Lankans hold gold jewellery they may not use frequently or may wish to convert into a more sound investment, we have introduced this exceptional offer to convert your old gold into new gold at the best rates in the market. Particularly in Sri Lanka, investing in gold has long been revered for its reliability, delivering consistent returns, and preserving your wealth for generations.”

The process of exchanging old gold jewellery for new gold not only secures a sound investment but also allows for easy exchangeability into currency or jewellery as needed, while also offering potential efficiencies for holders in terms of tax planning in the future. newly crafted (gold bullion) pieces are also more easily stored and moved discretely, adding to their allure as a secure investment. As gold primes itself for a potential secular bull market, globally, investing in new gold emerges as one of the most high-yielding wealth growth strategies in 2024.
