Fairly heavy showers expected in parts of the island

The Meteorology Department says showers will occur at times in Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces and in Kandy, Nuwara-Eliya, Galle and Matara districts with fairly heavy showers of about 50 mm likely at some places.

Several spells of showers may occur in North-western province and in Matale district, it said.

Showers or thundershowers may occur at a few places in Eastern and Uva provinces during the evening or night.

Strong winds of about 40-45 kmph can be expected at times over the western slopes of the central hills and in Northern, North-central and Southern provinces and in Matale and Puttalam districts.

The general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
