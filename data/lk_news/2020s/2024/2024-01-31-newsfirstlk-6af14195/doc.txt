Sri Lanka’s Political Alliance Odyssey

COLOMBO (News 1st);  In the backdrop of the highly anticipated 2024 presidential election, a dynamic shift is observable in the political landscape, bringing forth the emergence of novel alliances.

The 2020 Sri Lankan Parliamentary General Election saw a decisive victory for the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, which secured 145 of the 225 seats, solidifying its position as the dominant party.

The Samagi Jana Balawegaya emerged as the main opposition with 54 seats, while the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kattchi emerged as the third strongest voice, winning 10 seats.

The Jathika Jana Balavegaya also gained a noteworthy foothold with 3 seats, and the Eelam People's Democratic Party secured 2 seats.

Ten other parties shared the remaining seats as one each. What has happened now?

The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), despite its 145-seat victory in the 2020 election, has broken apart into multiple factions.

A considerable number of its MPs have left the party at various points, citing various reasons.

The Uttara Lanka Sabhagaya, a political alliance led by Wimal Weerawansa, includes 12 MPs from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna.

Additionally, the coalition has gained the support of the Ape Janabala Party through the inclusion of its National List MP position.

A dissident group from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna led by Dallas Alahapperuma formed the Freedom People's Congress.

Maithripala Sirisena, Dayasiri Jayasekara, Shan Vijayalal, and Dushmantha Mithrapala, who are from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, and were elected to Parliament under the banner of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, now serve in the  opposition.

The Former Sports Minister, who recently announced their candidacy for the upcoming presidential election, opened a campaign office in Nugegoda yesterday.

The event was attended by four other members of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, who represent the Freedom People's Congress.

Amidst the political landscape in 2024, the 11 MPs who broke away from the SLPP in 2022 are now making waves in various parties and a new alliance.

Initially declaring their independent stance in 2022, these MPs, including Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, have since formed alliances and joined other parties, showcasing a shift in the political landscape.

The 'Alliance for a New Economic Journey' is joined by7 Minister Nalin Fernando, and Dr. Susil Premajayantha, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, and Nimal Lanza.

The Samagi Jana Balavegaya that contested under the sysmbol of the 'Telephone' had 54-seats in parliament, however, a group from within altered their political course.

MPs Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakkara as well as MP Vadivel Suresh now work alongside the President.
