Families complain on over 400 Sri Lankans in Russia-Ukraine war

Colombo, May 19 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka's Defence Ministry has received over 400 complaints from family members of citizens recruited by mercenary companies to fight in the Russia-Ukraine war.

Authorities launched an investigation earlier this month into reports of Sri Lankan nationals with military backgrounds being trafficked to fight in Ukraine.

In response, the Defence Ministry set up a hotline for family members to lodge complaints after a few returnees exposed the deadly conditions faced by mostly ex-soldiers fighting primarily for Russia. The Ministry reported that a total of 411 complaints have been received so far.

It was reported that not only former members of the security forces but also citizens without any military training have been recruited as mercenaries in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

The government has decided to send a delegation to Russia to identify and repatriate its citizens fighting for Russia in Ukraine.
