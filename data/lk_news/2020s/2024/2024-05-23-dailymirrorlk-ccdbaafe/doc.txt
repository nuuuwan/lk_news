Dawson Bungalow to be sold?

Colombo, May 23 (Daily Mirror) - Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Kabir Hashim in Parliament yesterday questioned about an alleged move to sell off the historical Dawson Bungalow situated in the Kegalle District.

" The employees of the bungalow had informed about a move to sell it. They have complained that their opinion has not been called for to date," the MP said.

"The bungalow holds historical significance as it was once the residence of Britisher Dawson, who played a key role in the construction of the Colombo Kandy road," he said.

MP Hashim suggested that instead of being sold, the bungalow should be converted into a museum. He also noted that the bungalow is currently owned by the Road Development Authority.
