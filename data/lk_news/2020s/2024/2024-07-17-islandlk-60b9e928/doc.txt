SLT-MOBITEL, the National ICT Solutions Provider, and Sri Lanka’s most-loved ride hailing and food delivery app, Uber, have come together to offer tailor-made, value-added connectivity solutions for merchants, couriers, and drivers registered on Uber’s platform in Sri Lanka.

As part of the partnership, customized connectivity solutions designed to meet the unique needs of merchants, couriers, and drivers were announced in the presence of senior leaders from both companies under ‘Uber Package’. Given the rapid use of smartphones and internet connectivity, in the app-based economy, along with high data consumption, the package offered under this partnership fulfills Data, Calls, and SMS requirements at an unbeatable price. Features of this package include 15 GB Data for Uber, Google Maps, and WhatsApp, along with an additional 5GB of Anytime Data for browsing and streaming purposes. It also offers 750 minutes of calls and 750 SMS to any network, at just Rs. 597.
