Sri Lankan missions getting stripped of authority in issuing visas

Colombo, June 6 (Daily Mirror) - Overseas Sri Lankan missions are in the process of being stripped of their authority to issue different categories of visas for foreign nationals including resident visas with the introduction of online application, an official said.

Sri Lanka has now introduced acceptance of online visas from foreign nationals intending to visit Sri Lanka. As a result, the Sri Lankan missions virtually lose their authority to accept document and issue visas.

Sri Lanka Department of Immigration and Emigration retains the sole authority to issue visas in partnership with VFS Global for processing applications. Asked for a comment in this regard, Controller General of Immigration and Emigration I.S.H.J. Ilukpitiya said there is no need for any foreign national to reach the nearest Sri Lankan mission to apply for visas now.

“It is possible to be done online for anyone. Currently, the missions are authorized to accept documents from resident visa applicants. We will introduce online system for resident visa applicants soon. Then, the missions will naturally lose the authority to accept documents for resident visa as well,” he said.

The Department of Immigration and Emigration reserves the power of approving, issuing or rejecting visas under the Immigrants and Emigrants Act No. 20 of 1948.

VFS Global only receive the documents related to sending the relevant documents for online visa approval from applicants and send them to the department.
