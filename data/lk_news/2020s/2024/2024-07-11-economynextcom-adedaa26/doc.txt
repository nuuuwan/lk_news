Sri Lanka’s NWSDB considers smart to cut cost on expensive water meter readers

ECONOMYNEXT  Sri Lanka’s National Water Supply and Drainage Board is considering to go with smart water meters to cut down expensive wage paid for 1,100 manual water readers, Water Supply Minister Jeevan Thondaman said.

“They are paid 150,000 rupees a month. It is higher than my salary of 76,000 rupees. They work almost four days in a month,” the Minister told a Foreign Correspondent Association (FCA) Forum in Colombo late on Wednesday.

“So now we are considering to fix 600,000 smart water meter within the next two years.”

He said smart meters will give accurate and clear data while reducing the room for corruption.

Thondaman’s new move comes as the government is in the process of rationalizing all the expenditures on state-owned enterprises.

Under President Ranil Wickremesighe’s government, the NWSDB’s monthly loss of 2.3 billion rupees has turned into the same amount of monthly profit, Thondaman said.

The NWSDB  is still in the process of optimising its human resources and had brought down the total employees to around 8,000 from 12,300 when Minister Thondaman was handed over the Water Board, he said.

”We can manage this with only 6,500 employees,” he said adding that some people had been recruited based on political affiliation in the past,” he said. (Colombo/July 11, 2024)
