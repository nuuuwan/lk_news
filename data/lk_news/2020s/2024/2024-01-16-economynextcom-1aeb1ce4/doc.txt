Sri Lanka working with foreign payment apps for QR payments

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is working with international payment aps to allow foreigners to make transaction through Lanka QR, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.

“Lanka QR will be extended to foreign payment apps so that both foreign customers and local will utilze Lanka QR for payments in Sri Lanka. That’s where we are working with India’s Upay and some other arrangements,” he said delivering the annual policy statement for 2024, last week (10).

Though Lanka QR has been around for some time, it has not been very active, Weerasinghe said.

“To promote digital transactions and remittances via e-money services, the value limits of enhanced e-money accounts and basic human accounts were increased with effect from January 1.

“The Central Bank expects to revise regulations to support expansion of digital payments and to revise the existing regulatory sandbox framework to facilitate more FinTechs entering the regulatory sandbox; that’s to encourage FinTechs to bring in new innovations and solutions.” (Colombo/Jan16/2024)
