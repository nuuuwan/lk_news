Colombo, May 30 (Daily Mirror) - Ruwan Jayasekara, alias Midigama Ruwan, a notorious underworld figure allegedly involved in planning an attack on the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) headquarters in Colombo to free drug trafficker Nadun Chinthaka alias 'Harak Kata', is to be extradited to Sri Lanka today.

Midigama Ruwan, who is also the brother-in-law of Nadun Chinthaka, was reportedly arrested by Dubai Police in March. Harak Kata himself was arrested by Dubai authorities last year and subsequently deported to Sri Lanka.

It was reported that a special police team has been dispatched to Dubai to bring the suspect back to Sri Lanka.
