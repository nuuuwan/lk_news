Sri Lanka discusses legal framework, EOI for nuclear energy: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lankan officials are discussing the proposed legal framework and expressions of interest for nuclear energy projects in the country, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera has said.

“Discussed the progress of the proposed legal framework on nuclear energy integration, EOI for nuclear energy, technology and technical evaluation, long term generation requirement, safety and policy planning,” Wijesekera said on X (twitter) after a meeting with senior officials of the Atomic Energy Authority and Atomic Energy Board yesterday.

Sri Lanka has given cabinet approval to call for EOIs from suitable investors to establish a nuclear power plant in Sri Lanka, but legal frameworks are required by global agencies before establishing a nuclear power plant in the country.

Late last year, Wijesekara told parliament that several countries including Russia, India, France and the United States had offered to collaborate with Sri Lanka on nuclear technology.

“There are a number of proposals on nuclear power…. But we need to know the appropriate technology for us. We need to pre plan on a number of factors,” the Minister has said earlier.

Wijesekera has said technical and financial assistance was sought from the Republic of Korea to develop nuclear energy projects. (Colombo/Jun13/2024)
