Special security arrangements for Good Friday and Easter Sunday

Sri Lanka Police is organizing a special security plan to be set in place at churches across the country in view of the upcoming Good Friday and Easter Sunday, as per the instructions of Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon.

Accordingly, the police chief has given directives to all officers including the Senior Deputy Inspectors General of Police (SDIGs), DIGs and officers in charge (OICs) of police divisions.

The OICs are instructed to meet with the priests and boards of trustees of churches to prepare security plans tailored to each church while the Holy Masses are in progress from 29 - 31 March, Police Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa said commenting on the matter.

Under this security plan, the church premises would be inspected before the commencement of the sermons in a manner that does not disturb the devotees.

Further, if it is deemed necessary to conduct body searches before allowing the devotees to enter the church premises, the police officers are instructed to make necessary preparations after discussing with the priests and boards of trustees of respective churches.

Special attention will be given to churches that attract crowds in large numbers, the police spokesman added.

Further, instructions have been given to obtain the assistance of the Special Task Force (STF) and the Tri-Forces personnel in the event the number of police officers deployed to churches is inadequate.
