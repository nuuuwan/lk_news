Prevailing windy conditions likely to continue - Met. Department

The Meteorology Department says the prevailing windy conditions over the island are expected to continue further, due to the active South-west Monsoonal condition.

Several spells of showers will occur in Western, Sabaragamuwa and North-western provinces and in Kandy, Nuwara-Eliya, Galle and Matara districts.

Strong winds of about 50-60kmph can be expected at times over Western slopes of the central hills and in Northern, North-central and North-western provinces and in Trincomalee, Monaragala and Hambantota districts, it said.

Fairly strong winds about 30-40kmph can be expected at times elsewhere of the island.
