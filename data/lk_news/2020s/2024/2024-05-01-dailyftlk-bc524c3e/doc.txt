Cabinet clears visa exemption pact between Rwanda and Sri Lanka

Aims to exempt citizens holding diplomatic, duty, service passports needing visas for up to 30 days

The Cabinet of Ministers at its meeting on Monday cleared the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Rwanda and Sri Lanka to exempt citizens holding diplomatic duty or service passports from obtaining visas for a period not exceeding 30 days as agreed between the two parties.

“The decision aims to improve bilateral relations between the two countries,” Cabinet Co-Sokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said yesterday at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing.

Originally approved on 7 May 2019, the proposal sought to establish an understanding to waive visa requirements for holders of specific passports from both countries, but the signing of the MoU has faced delays.

The proposal to this effect submitted by Public Security Minister Tiran Alles was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
