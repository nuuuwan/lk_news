Independent committee to probe Raviâ€™s appointment as NDF National List MP

The New Democratic Front (NDF) has decided to conduct an independent inquiry into the appointment of Ravi Karunanayake as an MP from the National List of the alliance.

Accordingly, a four-member committee has been appointed for this purpose during a meeting held today (20) under the patronage of former President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Furthermore, it has been decided that the final report pertaining to the inquiry should be handed over to former President Wickremesinghe within a period of three weeks.

The report will later be forwarded to the Executive Committee of the United National Party (UNP), as decided during the NDF meeting.
