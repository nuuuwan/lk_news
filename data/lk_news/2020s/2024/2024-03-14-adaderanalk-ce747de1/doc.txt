Proposals on International Competitive Bidding (ICB) for a 50 MW wind farm facility in Mannar have been called for by the Ministry of Power and Energy and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).

Accordingly, the ICB calls for suitable developers with the financial and technical ability to develop a 50MW wind farm facility in Mannar on a Build, Own and Operate (BOO) basis, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said on ‘X’ (formerly Twitter).

He further noted that deadline to submit the relevant proposal will be on 09 May, immediately after which the proposals will be opened at the office of the CEB Deputy General Manager of Renewable Energy Procurement and Performance Monitoring, in the presence of the authorised representatives of the project proponents.
