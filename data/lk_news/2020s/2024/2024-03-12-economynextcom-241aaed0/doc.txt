Sri Lanka meets 92 pct of its sanitary napkin demand domestically, tax-free: official

ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka meets 92 percent of its demand for sanitary napkins domestically, all of which is tax-free barring the remaining 8 percent, State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

Siyambalapitiya told reporters that the remaining eight percent, which he said is manufactured by a single company as finished products, is charged the  Ports and Airports Development Levy and the Social Security Contribution Levy and the Cess Tax.

“The total of these three comes up to 22.5 percent. There is no 40 percent tax as claimed. Up to 92 percent of pads made in Sri Lanka are not taxed,” he said.

Most of Sri Lanka’s sanitary napkin needs are made by three companies that import the materials and inputs and produce the napkins in the country.

In September 2022, opposition legislator Rohini Kaviratne said total import taxes on sanitary napkins was 42 percent and prices had skyrocketed after the rupee collapsed. With valued added tax increased to 15 percent from taxes would go up further, she said.

In October that year, President Ranil Wickremesinghe ordered the removal of all taxes imposed on imported sanitary materials and finished products, with value added tax (VAT) reduced to zero rupees. (Colombo/Mar12/2024)
