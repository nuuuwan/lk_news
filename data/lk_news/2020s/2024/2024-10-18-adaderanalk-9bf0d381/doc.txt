New board of directors appointed to Film Corporation and Foundation Institute

Minister of Buddha Sasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs, National Integration, Social Security and Mass Media Vijitha Herath emphasized the need for the National Film Corporation to adapt to contemporary times, compete with private entities, and progress accordingly.

He made these remarks during a meeting held today (18) at the Ministry of Mass Media Auditorium, appointing the Boards of Directors for the National Film Corporation and the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute.

The minister revealed the previous concerns about favoritism in film releases in the past, and urged the new board of Directors to ensure fair practices in this regard.

He also noted that representatives from all communities—Sinhalese, Tamils, and Muslims—were appointed back in 2004/2005, and Tamil cinema has yet to establish and develop itself as a viable industry in Sri Lanka in the future.

Commenting on the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute, the minister stated that the current officials should make decisions that address past shortcomings.
