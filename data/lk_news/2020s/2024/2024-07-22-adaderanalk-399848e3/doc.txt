The suspect, who was arrested in connection with the incident, had requested permission to make a confidential statement to the Kaduwela Magistrate. He made this request when the seven suspects arrested in relation to the incident were produced before the court on July 10.

However, the Kaduwela Magistrate had advised the suspect in question to rethink the decision and make the request again during an upcoming court date.
