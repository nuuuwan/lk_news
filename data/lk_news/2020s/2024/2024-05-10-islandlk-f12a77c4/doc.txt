Hemas Hospitals honours its nurses on International Nurses Day

Sri Lanka’s Most Loved Healthcare Brand, Hemas Hospitals is devoted to delivering compassionate patient-centric care in line with the highest international standards for quality and safety. Central to this commitment is its nursing staff; the quiet heroes, whose unparalleled dedication and expertise form the bedrock of Hemas Hospitals’ reputation for excellence.

Accordingly, on International Nurses Day, Hemas Hospitals celebrates its dedicated nurses, who help make every patient feel cared for and at home. International Nurses Day, which falls on the 12th of May each year, celebrates the love, dedication, passion and commitment of nurses, worldwide. The day also marks the birthday of the famous Florence Nightingale – the pioneering nurse of the 19th century, who revolutionized healthcare standards and established modern nursing practices. Through her tireless dedication and visionary leadership, she has left an indelible mark on nursing, and a shining example that is followed to date.

Discussing the vital role of nurses, Dorine De Souza – General Manager Nursing at Hemas Hospital said, “The skill, commitment and compassion of our nursing staff is pivotal in our pledge to delivering exceptional patient-centric care. Our nursing team embodies unmatched dedication, regularly persevering through the night, and sometimes even stretching shifts into the next day. Despite personal obligations, their commitment to patient care takes precedence, demonstrating a love that transcends duty. Their selflessness is truly inspiring. This is why, when people think of their experience at Hemas Hospitals, it is often the loving care they received from our teams – led by our nurses – that they remember. Therefore, let us take a moment to appreciate the invaluable contributions of our nursing staff on International Nurses Day!”

Going beyond the role of caregivers, the nursing team at Hemas Hospitals is comprised of highly trained, qualified, and passionate professionals. With state-of-the-art facilities in Wattala and Thalawathugoda, Hemas Hospitals provides an environment where nurses can thrive and excel in their roles, thanks to comprehensive training programmes, the Hemas Academy (a dedicated school for nurses), continuous professional development opportunities, and a culture of mentorship and growth.
