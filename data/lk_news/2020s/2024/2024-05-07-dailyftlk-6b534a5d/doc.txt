Hayleys powers Texlan Centre with landmark commercial solar installation

Hayleys Solar, the renewable energy arm of Hayleys Fentons, has successfully completed an impressive 2.3 MW capacity solar power installation for Texlan Centre Ltd., a leading hosiery manufacturer and exporter in the country.

The grid-tied rooftop solar power system constructed on the rooftop of Texlan’s manufacturing facility in Minuwangoda has a capacity of 2,343 kWp. This corresponds to a planned 63,539,152 kWh of clean energy generated over a 20-year span. This will cover an estimated 32% of Texlan’s energy needs, minimising the company’s reliance on conventional grid power while lowering operational costs. This will help to reduce 46,370 tons of greenhouse gas emissions over the project period.

“Sustainability is a core value at Texlan,” said Texlan Centre Ltd. Managing Director Muhammed Latif. “This solar installation represents a significant step forward in our efforts to reduce the environmental impact of our business and ensure long-term responsible manufacturing practices. We are excited to bring forth this commitment to clean energy in Sri Lanka with Hayleys Solar as our partner.”

“Our partnership with Texlan encourages them to do their part for the environment and sets a new benchmark for large-scale solar projects in the country,” said Hayleys Fentons Ltd. Managing Director Hasith Prematillake.

Hayleys Solar Executive Director and CEO Roshane Perera said: “Our strength in design engineering, logistics and installation was the key to completing this project, which showcases Hayleys Solar’s expertise in delivering large-scale, impactful clean energy solutions in a timely manner.”

Texlan’s decision to adopt solar power, facilitated by Hayleys Solar’s expertise, reflects a growing trend within Sri Lanka’s manufacturing sector, of adopting clean energy and taking accountability for the environmental.
