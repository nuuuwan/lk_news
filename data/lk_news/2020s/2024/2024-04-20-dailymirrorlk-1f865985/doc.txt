Catholic Church has not accepted Easter attacks proposals of NPP or SJB

Colombo, April 20 (Daily Mirror)- The Catholic Church has not accepted proposals of the National Peoples Power (NPP) or the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) over the probes into the Easter Sunday attacks, Member of the Communications Committee of the Archdiocese of Colombo, Fr. Cyril Gamini Fernando said today.

"We have to study the proposals of the SJB and NPP before deciding whether to accept them or not. It is true that the NPP and SJB handed over their proposals to the Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, but that does not mean the Church has accepted them," Fr. Fernando said.

He was responding to allegations by United National Party (UNP) General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara who said on Friday that people have become suspicious whether the Cardinal is trying to promote political parties.

"Range Bandara was a State Minister of the Yahapalana government during whose tenure the Easter Sunday attacks took place. This particular government ruled this country for months after the April 2019 bomb attacks. Therefore, there was ample time for that government to carry out a proper probe," he said.

Also Fr. Fernando said other political parties are also welcome to hand in their proposals on the Easter Sunday attacks.

"Political parties are welcome to hand in their proposals to us rather than talking of proposals given by others," he said.
