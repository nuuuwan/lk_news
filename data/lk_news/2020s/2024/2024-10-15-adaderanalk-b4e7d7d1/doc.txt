Govt. announcement on Rs. 3,000 increment for pensioners

Cabinet Spokesperson Minister Vijitha Herath announced that an additional Rs. 3,000 will be added to the monthly pension of government retirees starting next month. This decision, approved by the Cabinet of Ministers, comes as part of an interim allowance to provide immediate financial relief to pensioners.

Minister Herath explained that although the additional allowance was not included in the pensions disbursed by October 10th, the government is implementing a special program to ensure pensioners receive the Rs. 3,000 for this month in the coming days.

Funds for the allowance have already been released by the Treasury, according to the Minister.

The Minister also highlighted the long-standing issue of wage disparity among pensioners, noting that while it is a complex challenge that cannot be resolved quickly, the government has taken this step to offer some relief.

“Pensioners will receive this Rs. 3,000 allowance in the coming days for October, and starting next month, it will be added to their regular pension. This allowance will benefit all government pensioners,” Minister Herath stated.
