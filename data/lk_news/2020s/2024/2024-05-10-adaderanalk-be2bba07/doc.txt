Mujibur Rahman sworn in as MP

Mujibur Rahman of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) took path as a Member of Parliament before the Speaker, to fill the parliamentary seat vacated by the disqualification of former State Minister Diana Gamage.

The swearing-in took place after the Parliamentary session convened at 9.30 a.m. this morning (10).

The SJB had decided to nominate former Member of Parliament Mujibur Rahman to fill the National List MP position left vacant by the disqualification of former State Minister Diana Gamage from holding a parliamentary seat.

Meanwhile, a Gazette notification was issued last evening stating that Mujibur Rahman has been nominated by the SJB to fill the vacancy in Parliament created by the disqualification of Diana Gamage as Member of Parliament by a Supreme Court verdict.

Accordingly, the Election Commission, acting under section 64(5) of the Parliamentary Elections Act, No. 1 of 1981 read with provisions of the Constitution, announced that Mohamad Mujibur Rahman was declared elected as a Member of Parliament to fill the vacancy created due to the determination of the Supreme Court cancelling the parliamentary membership of Diana Gamage.

The Secretary-General of Parliament informed the Election Commission that a Parliamentary seat in the Ninth Parliament has become vacant from 08 May 2024, due to the cancellation of parliamentary seat of Member of Parliament Diana Gamage.

This was formally conveyed to the Chairman of the Election Commission in writing, pursuant to Section 64(1) of Parliamentary Elections Act No.01 of 1981.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday (May 08) declared that State Minister Diana Gamage is not legally qualified to hold a parliamentary seat.

Accordingly, delivering its verdict, the three-judge Supreme Court bench decided that Gamage is not eligible to hold the position of Member of Parliament as she holds dual citizenship.

In January 2023, SJB MP Mujibur Rahman decided to step down as a member of parliament in order to vie for the post of Mayor of Colombo in the now-postponed 2023 local government election.
