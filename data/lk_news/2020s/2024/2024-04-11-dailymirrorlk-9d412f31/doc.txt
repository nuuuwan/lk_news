RW can successfully implement reforms though own mandate: Prelate

Colombo, April 11 (Daily Mirror) - The Chief Prelate (Mahanayake) of the Kotte Sri Kalayani Samagri Dharma Maha Sangha Sabha of the Siyam Maha Nikaya, Ven. Dr. Ittapana Dhammalankara Anu Nayake Maha Thera said incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe can implement reforms successfully if he receives a mandate of his own at a future presidential election.

Thera made this remark when UNP Deputy Leader and Presidential Advisor Ruwan Wijewardene met him today.

"One cannot bring about reforms through votes received by others," he said.

"Ranil Wickremesinghe will be the most politically mature candidate in the next Presidential election," Thera added.

"There will be other candidates, such as Anura Kumara Dissanayake at the next Presidential election. There is nothing wrong in them contesting the presidential election, but the incumbent president will be the most mature candidate at the next presidential poll," he added.

Wijewardene said Sri Lanka's economy is becoming better and better.

"The economy would be much better by the time we face the next election," he said.
