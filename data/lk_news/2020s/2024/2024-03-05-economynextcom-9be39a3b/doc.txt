Sri Lanka rupee at 308 to US dollar after opening stronger

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka rupee opened stronger at 307.50/90 levels from yesterdays close of 307.90/95 and moved down to 307.90/308.10 levels amid official purchases, market participants said.

Sri Lanka’s rupee is stable amid largely deflationary policy from the central bank helped by slow private credit and improving government borrowings, which is triggering a balance of payments surplus.

Banks also tend to sell dollars and run negative net open positions when the central bank allows the currency to strengthen.

The rupee has in the recent past been volatile when small changes in import demand comes from changes in  credit as the central bank does sell dollars and banks also buy dollars to square their open positions, analysts say.
