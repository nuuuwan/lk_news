Pavitra oversees preparations to open Uma Oya project on Wednesday

Irrigation, Wildlife and Forestry Minister Pavitra Wanniarachchi announced that all arrangements have been finalised for the handover of the Uma Oya multi-purpose development project to the public on Wednesday.

Speaking to the media after inspecting the project site, Wanniarachchi expressed satisfaction with the progress and highlighted the significance of the project for the country.

Under the leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe and President of Iran Ibrahim Raisi, the project is set to be inaugurated on 24 April, marking a significant milestone in Sri Lanka’s development journey.

The Uma Oya multi-purpose development project, which began in 2010 with an estimated cost of $ 514 million, is a collaborative effort between Sri Lanka and Iran. The project aims to harness water resources for hydroelectricity generation, irrigation and providing drinking water to several regions. During her visit to the project sites, she observed the Diaraba and Puhulpola Reservoirs, integral components of the project responsible for water collection for electricity production. The underground power plant in Ella Karandagolla was also inspected, where the generation of 120 MW of hydroelectricity is set to benefit the national power grid.

Highlighting the project’s impact on agriculture, Wanniarachchi noted that electricity generated from the project will facilitate the cultivation of thousands of acres of paddy fields in Monaragala and Badulla districts.

Additionally, the project will directly irrigate vast stretches of farmland, boosting agricultural productivity and livelihoods in the region.

The project’s scope includes the construction of dams, tunnels, and power lines to facilitate water and electricity distribution. Upon completion, excess water will be directed to reservoirs in the Hambantota district, benefiting further agricultural activities in the region.
