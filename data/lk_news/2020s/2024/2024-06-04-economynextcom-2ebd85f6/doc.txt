Sri Lanka faces barriers in reclaiming priceless artifacts from Britain

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is facing legal barriers in its efforts to reclaim priceless artifacts from Britain, as many of these items are held by private individuals rather than the state, Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs Minister Vidura Wickremenayake said.

Sri Lanka has been actively requesting the return of invaluable artifacts taken during colonial rule prior to the country’s independence in 1948.

Last year, the Netherlands returned six Kandyan artifacts, including gold and silver ceremonial swords, two wall guns, and Lewke Disave’s cannon, after a formal request.

“We have made similar requests to the British government. However, the challenge is that many of these artifacts are in the possession of individuals, not the state,” Wickremenayake told EconomyNext.

“We cannot ask private British citizens to return these items in the same way we request from the British government. We have a substantial list of artifacts taken during the British period.”

Historians note that the artifacts stolen during the colonial rule of the Portuguese, Dutch, and British, from 1505 to 1948, are a testament to Sri Lanka’s rich cultural heritage and the impacts of colonial exploitation.

The ongoing efforts to reclaim these artifacts are aimed at restoring historical and cultural justice, not just recovering physical objects.

Government officials have documented instances of the Portuguese taking sacred relics, including items of religious significance from Buddhist temples, as war trophies, as well as royal artifacts and regalia from the Kandyan and other Sinhalese kingdoms.

The Dutch removed cultural artifacts such as traditional masks, ceremonial objects, religious items, ola leaf manuscripts, and other documents that provide insight into Sri Lanka’s history and culture.

The British colonial period saw the most extensive removal of Sri Lankan artifacts. Items taken included royal artifacts such as thrones, crowns, and other ceremonial objects, as well as numerous Buddha statues, religious texts, and temple decorations.

Additionally, cultural artifacts like traditional crafts and artworks were collected and shipped to Britain, often ending up in private collections or museums.

The efforts to reclaim these artifacts highlight the broader struggle for post-colonial nations to restore their cultural heritage and rectify historical injustices. (Colombo/June 04/2024)
