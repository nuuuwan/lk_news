Hope springs eternal: Not in politics!

When Alexander Pope coined the phrase “Hope springs eternal”, which later became proverbial, in his 1732 work ‘An Essay on Man’, he would not have imagined that it would become totally irrelevant to politics in the twenty-first century! The US, the country that dominates the world, by hook or by crook, is in search of a new leader and the choice offered does not give much hope. After the dementing present leader was forced out of his ambitions for a second term, he was hastily replaced by his deputy without giving Democrats a chance to look for a proper substitute. Hitherto inconspicuous Vice President Harris, whose main attribute is inappropriate laughter, is changing policies on the hoop to get elected whilst her opponent scores his own goals, as he blurts out before thinking though he may have better policies. Trump, to his credit, was not a war-monger during his presidency, unlike his predecessor Obama, who having won the Nobel Peace Prize went on to destroy Libya and Syria! The US hails the value of democracy but its own democratic process is tainted with violence. Four presidents have been assassinated, three more have been shot at but survived and there have already been two attempts at Trump’s life during this campaign, one of which nearly succeeded!

British voters threw out the Conservatives, who excelled in back-stabbing during their tenure of 14 years, and elected a socialist Labour government. The first task of the new government, which got a massive majority though the percentage poll did not increase thanks to splitting of the Conservative vote by the right-wing Reform Party, was to give above inflation pay rises to train drivers and to junior doctors, who seem to have taken the cue from our GMOA and had protracted strikes. This created a black hole in UK finances to the tune of 9 billion UK Pounds and the government clawed back some of it by withdrawing the winter fuel allowance given to pensioners! We castigate our politicians for corruption but Comrade Sir Keir Starmer, who is estimated to have a wealth of around three million Pounds, has received from a Labour Peer, Lord Alli, £18685 worth of work clothes and several pairs of glasses, according to a news item in The Sunday Times (UK) of 15th September. It does not stop there; Lord Alli has paid for a personal shopper, and clothes for Lady Starmer as well, which the PM has forgotten to declare in the Common’s register. The wonderful justification for these actions came from the Foreign Secretary, who stated in a BBC political interview that the PM and his wife had to be dressed well when representing the UK in foreign forums and they had to do this because there are no allowances for dresses, paid for by the tax-payer! Remember the story of a toddy thief who claimed he had been cutting grass on a kitul palm, when he was caught!

Our Rathu Sahodarayas are no different. Their leader wore expensive suits in his foreign sojourns and does not use the double-cab he claims to own but is chauffeured around in the most expensive of vehicles. The person described as his future Prime Minister has justified this, claiming that it was done at party cost. Suddenly, the JVP seems to have metamorphosed to a rich capitalist party! If one goes by the massive information campaign by his supporters, Anura Sahodaraya should have the biggest ever presidential victory of all time. I was dragged into a WhatsApp group which I wanted to leave but remained out of interest. I received about 20 messages from just one of his supporters, and I deleted them immediately!

In spite of personal problems, I was anxiously waiting for the much-advertised presidential debate in BMICH, which was to be broadcast live on many TV channels and was channel hopping when it did not start, to find a late start with only Dilith Jayaweera attending. Perhaps, voters should take him more seriously as he is the only candidate prepared to debate policies! Also, he seems to be the only one who seems to have declared his assets genuinely but the biggest paradox is that he is contesting from the Communist Party. I did not realise that the Communist Party had become the party of multi-millionaires! It looks as if political parties have got richer while the populace is reduced to penury!

Judging from far, it looks as if the presidential contest is three-cornered this time. Wonder the euphoria around AKD is justified, in spite of his supporters attempting to distance him from the JVP and say that he is the leader of the NPP. Looking at the constituents of the NPP, it is predominantly JVP and this projection seems just an excuse to distance him from the violent past. I have written asking AKD to be honest and admit past mistakes. The fact that they had not given up on violence was amply demonstrated by violence during Aragalaya as well as the pronouncements by some of the extremist members. AKD’s pledges on higher education seems to be a joke when one considers that it is his party that disrupts universities perennially.

As far as Ranil is concerned, the less said, the better. True, he took over the reins when the country was in distress but when he had power, he turned out to be a dictator who defied even the judiciary. He presided over two bond scams and not learning any lessons, allowed the visa scam. As a result of this scam, as tourist arrivals were falling, the government was forced to introduce the visa-free scheme, resulting in a massive loss of foreign exchange. Further, no sooner had the presidential election been declared than he became Father Christmas, doling out unaffordable gifts to everyone! Is this not corruption?

If he can get rid of his ‘kitchen cabinet’, Sajith and his SJB team may be able to do something good for the country. It is the fear of this that has made both Ranil and AKD pointing out that the presidential election is not to elect a team. However, it has to be admitted that a good team is essential for any elected president to save Sri Lanka, which is still in a perilous state.

Considering all this, it looks as if the Sri Lankan voters do not seem to have even a Hobson’s choice.
