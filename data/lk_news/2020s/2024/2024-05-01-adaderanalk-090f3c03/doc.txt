Cement price further reduced

The maximum retail price of a 50kg bag of cement has been reduced by Rs. 50 to Rs. 2,400 with effect from today (May 01).

The industry media announcement stated that cement at the new Maximum Retail Price will be available in the market from today onwards.

The price revision reportedly aims to boost the local construction industry by passing on the cost benefit to consumers.
