National & children’s hospitals to be built in Biyagama

Plans are afoot to establish a National Hospital and a Children’s Hospital in Biyagama area of Gampaha District due to the high demand for health services in the area, the government says.

As a result of the growing population and industrialization in the Gampaha District, it acts as a major service delivery centre. Accordingly, the government has recognized the need to build a National Hospital and a Children’s Hospital there in order to meet the rising demand for health services.

On that account, the Cabinet of Ministers, at its meeting on Monday (Feb.12), green-lighted a proposal to implement the project after acquiring 2 plots of land, stretching across 7 acres and 3 roods, located in Biyagama North Grama Niladhari Division and providing basic infrastructure.

The proposal was tabled by President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana.

The project is planned to be carried out under a public-private partnership.
