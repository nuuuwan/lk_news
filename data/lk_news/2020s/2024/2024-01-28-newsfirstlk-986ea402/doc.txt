Sri Lanka-India Ferry Link Set to Sail Again After 40 Years

COLOMBO (News 1st); Centuries-old maritime ties between Sri Lanka and India are set to be revived with the planned resumption of a passenger ferry service between the two nations.

The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation confirmed that the service, operating from Kankasanthura in Sri Lanka to Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu, India, will begin on February 15th, 2024.

This marks a significant milestone after a four-decade hiatus in passenger ferry operations between the two countries.

The service was previously suspended due to various internal circumstances in Sri Lanka.

However, with renewed efforts and approval from the Indian government, the ferry's return opens up a new chapter in bilateral connectivity, and it will be possible to travel to India at a low cost.
