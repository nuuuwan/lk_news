Sajith says he is PM candidate, no collaboration with Ranil

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa says that he was unanimously chosen as the Prime Ministerial candidate of the ‘Samagi Jana Sandhanaya’ for the upcoming General Election.

Furthermore, he stated that there would be no collaboration between former President Ranil Wickremesinghe and him.

Earlier today, the United National Party (UNP) announced that former President Ranil Wickremesinghe will not contest the upcoming General Election.

UNP Deputy Leader, Ruwan Wijewardena also stated that Wickremesinghe does not expect to enter Parliament through the National List and that instead, he has invited the Samagi Jana Sandhanaya to contest collectively.

However, Premadasa has now said that there will be no collaboration between Wickremesinghe and himself.

Responding to a question from reporters regarding claims that he could have won the election if he had contested together with UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, Premadasa said:

“If you look at numbers alone, you could reach such a conclusion. But if you conduct a deeper political analysis, it is clear that is not true.”

He further stated that “We are moving forward as Samagi Jana Sandhanaya and those who are ‘accepted’ by the public can join hands with us.”

“Today, all the electoral organizers of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and all the MPs unanimously proposed that I lead the General Election campaign as the Prime Ministerial candidate,” he added.
