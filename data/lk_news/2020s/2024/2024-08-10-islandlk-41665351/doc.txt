Spa Ceylon partnering WNPS to raise awareness on Human-Elephant Conflict

Spa Ceylon, the world’s largest luxury Ayurveda wellness brand, is partnering the Wildlife & Nature Protection Society (WNPS) to raise awareness about the Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC) and support affected communities in Sri Lanka. This initiative coincides with World Elephant Day 2024, which is celebrated on August 11.

The campaign kicks off with “Help Save the Majestic Ceylon Elephant Wellness Run” on August 11, starting at 6:00 am from Independence Square, Colombo. The event will feature 5km and 2km runs, with prizes for the top three participants. Interested individuals can register online or on the day of the event.

Following the run, Spa Ceylon will launch the “Gaja Nana Sahana” Scholarship Program to aid children who have lost a parent due to HEC. The program aims to provide financial support for their education. Over the past five years, HEC has resulted in 689 human deaths, with 169 fatalities in 2023 alone.

Speaking to journalists on Wednesday, Shalin Balasuriya, Co-Founder and Group Director of Spa Ceylon, emphasized the importance of elephant conservation as a national responsibility.

Balasuriya highlighted the brand’s commitment to resolving HEC and promoting holistic wellness for the planet and its people.

Supun Lahiru Prakash, Chair of the Human-Elephant Coexistence Subcommittee at WNPS, outlined strategies for mitigating HEC, including strengthening legislative frameworks, promoting low-cost mitigation measures and enhancing scientific understanding.

The initiative also includes an Awareness Bus Ride which will commence from Independence Square on August 12 at 1 pm and travel along Metro Colombo, covering a distance of 40km. Meanwhile, the Nations Trust WNPS Monthly Lecture will be held on August 15 at 6.30 pm at the Jasmine Hall, BMICH. The lecture, titled “Co-existing with Wild Elephants – A comparison between Botswana and Sri Lanka,” will feature conservationists Dr. Tempe Adams and Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya, who will discuss HEC strategies and challenges.

WNPS President Graham Marshall and Immediate Past President Jehan CanagaRetna thanked Spa Ceylon for its efforts in this field, lauding also their dedicated Ceylon Elephant range initiative, aimed at supporting elephant conservation and improving community resilience in Sri Lanka.
