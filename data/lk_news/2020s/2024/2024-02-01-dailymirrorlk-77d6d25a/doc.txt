Travel ban imposed on Keheliya Rambukwella

Colombo, Feb 01 (Daily Mirror) -Â  An overseas travel ban has been imposed on former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella by the Maligakanda Magistrate.

The magistrate's decision comes in conjunction with an order directing Rambukwella to appear before the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Friday, February 2.

Rambukwella's overseas travel restrictions come in light of his failure to comply with a prior summons from the CID, scheduled for Wednesday, January 31. On that day, Rambukwella was notably absent, attributing his absence to his involvement in a hearing at the Colombo High Court regarding an ongoing case and his attendance at a committee meeting convened at the Presidential Secretariat.

In response to the CID's summons, Rambukwella has formally requested, in writing, for the CID to designate an alternative date for him to provide his statement.
