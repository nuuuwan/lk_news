SJB firm on non-support - Nalin Bandara highlights incompatibility with SLPP

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Nalin Bandara yesterday expressed the party’s inability to support the President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s endeavours to revive Sri Lanka, citing his collaboration with the leaders of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the same party responsible for the country’s bankruptcy.

“The President has made many statements of Government policy within the last two years. In turn, Government MPs are now singing the praises of the President. Yesterday President Wickremesinghe questioned why the SJB cannot support him as the Pohottuwa members have. That is the very reason we cannot support his efforts,” Bandara said.  He remarked that those responsible for leading the country to bankruptcy since 2005 are now praising Wickremesinghe, and they appear to view the President in a favourable light.  “SJB lawyers even filed cases against them, and they were found responsible for the crisis. Hence, we are unable to collaborate with them,” he said.
