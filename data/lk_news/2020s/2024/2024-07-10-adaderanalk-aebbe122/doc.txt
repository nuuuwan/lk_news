Cabinet approves resolution to amend Constitutional clause on President’s tenure

The Cabinet of Ministers has granted approval to prepare a draft bill relevant to Constitutional reforms for the amendment of Article 83b of the constitution substituting the clause “exceeding 5 years” instead of the clause “exceeding 6 years”.

The relevant proposal has been submitted to the Cabinet by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in order to remove the doubt about it and remove any inconsistency regarding the tenure of the President and the tenure of the Parliament in Articles 30(2), 62(2) and 83(b) of the Constitution.
