Sri Lanka to entertain fresh applicants for Aswesuma subsidy scheme from Feb 15

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will entertain new applications for the ‘Aswesuma’ income subsidy scheme from February 15, with payments due to begin from July 2024, State Minister Finance Shehan Semasinghe has said.

The budget has allocated 205 billion rupees for welfare payments in 2024, Semasinghe was quoted in a government statement.

“A discussion was held at the Ministry of Finance with provincial governors, chief secretaries and provincial ministry secretaries regarding getting the support of provincial council officials to make the second round of calling for “Aswesuma” applications a success”, State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe said on X (Twitter).

Sri Lanka’s subsidy scheme is supported by the World Bank and is included in the International Monetary Fund program with a minimum spend as a target.

A large section of the population was thrown in poverty after the central bank printed money to target growth (potential output) and the rupee collapsed from 184 to 360 over two years.

Since printing money for ‘potential output’ began after the end of a 30-year civil war, denying monetary stability to the people, the statistic itself itself has shrunk.

Meanwhile Minister Semasinghe said that with the help of staff experienced in social services it was possible to prepare a more accurate list for the second phase of the project.

2.4 million people are to be selected under the second phase, overcoming setbacks faced in the first phase, Semasinghe was quoted as saying.

Semasinghe rejected the accusation that the scheme was a means to influence upcoming elections.

He said that all applications will be considered equally subject to the criteria for providing welfare benefits. (Colombo/Feb14/2024)
