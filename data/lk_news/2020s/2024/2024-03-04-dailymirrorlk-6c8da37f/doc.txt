Skyrocketing coconut prices will affect meal packets

Colombo, March 04 (Daily Mirror) -Â  The skyrocketing prices of coconuts will have a serious effect on the packed rice and curry meals in the future, as most of the curries are prepared with the coconut cream, food industry trade unions said.

All Island Canteen Owners Association President Rukshan Harshana told the media yesterday the usual price of a coconut, which was at Rs.60 to 80, has increased to almost double. A coconut is currently sold between Rs.120 to 150.

He said the canteen and eatery owners are faced with a serious situation to prepare the rice and curry meal packets under the increased coconut prices, thus in uncertainty of having to sell meal packs for a very high rate.

The unexpected price hike of coconuts comes at a moment when everything else including rice, chicken, eggs and gas has significantly gone up.

Harshana warned that the prices of coconut oil will also go up in the coming days owing to the sudden hike of coconuts.
