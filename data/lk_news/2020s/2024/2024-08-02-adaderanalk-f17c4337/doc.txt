Sri Lanka praised for effective management of foreign policy - Ali Sabry

Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry said that President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s decision to set up three special committees as a proactive measure to address potential crises in the Middle East is highly timely.

The Minister highlighted that while international events are uncontrollable; waiting for a country to collapse is not an option. He assured that steps have been taken to handle any emerging situation.

Minister Ali Sabry made these remarks at a press conference yesterday (01) at the Presidential Media Center, themed ‘Collective Path to a Stable Country’.

He underscored that President Wickremesinghe’s forward-thinking decisions have ensured Sri Lanka’s economic stability, preventing it from becoming another Venezuela. He urged everyone to set aside party politics and support the President’s efforts to rebuild the country, according to the President’s, Media Division.

“Over the past two years, our country has faced numerous international challenges. The initial challenge was securing the support of our creditor nations, including the Paris Club, for joining the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme.

Coordinating with various countries proved to be a complex task, but we successfully garnered their support for debt restructuring—a significant achievement in our foreign policy. This success is largely due to President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s expertise in managing international relations.

Recent visits to Japan, Singapore, Romania, and Poland have also been highly successful. These trips addressed many longstanding issues and facilitated the resumption of 13 suspended projects by Japan, worth $1.1 billion. Additionally, discussions with Singapore focused on investments, while talks with Romania aimed at creating new job opportunities. We also engaged in discussions with Poland regarding the establishment of an embassy.

These accomplishments are a testament to President Wickremesinghe’s visionary leadership. His ability to navigate both Eastern and Western nations effectively has been instrumental in achieving these outcomes.

Foreignpolicy.com, a prestigious magazine on international diplomacy, has praised Sri Lanka for its effective management of foreign policy. This endorsement confirms that our strategic approach has led to significant successes for the country.

In response to potential crises in the Middle East, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has appointed three special committees as a proactive measure. One committee focuses on national security, another on the economic situation and ensuring the availability of essential goods, and a third, chaired by the President and Prime Minister, oversees the work of the other two.

The fuel crisis of 2022, exacerbated by the Russian-Ukrainian war, led to sharp increases in fuel, coal, and wheat prices, which the country struggled to manage. In light of these challenges, the President’s decision to establish these committees represents a timely and prudent step to prevent a recurrence of such crises.

We convened to develop a programme aimed at stabilising the country’s energy sector and ensuring an uninterrupted supply of essential goods. While some situations are within a country’s control, international events are not. However, we should not wait for external factors to cause a collapse.

Over the past two years, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has demonstrated his capability to stabilise Sri Lanka without allowing it to become another Venezuela. We are therefore gratified by our decision in 2022 to support President Wickremesinghe in navigating the country through its crisis.

Although we have moved from a dire situation to a level of stability, we are still at a precarious stage. Even a small misstep could lead us back into severe difficulties. The opposition must decide whether to further destabilise the country or contribute to its recovery. It is crucial for everyone to set aside party politics and support President Wickremesinghe’s economic programme to build a robust economy”.
