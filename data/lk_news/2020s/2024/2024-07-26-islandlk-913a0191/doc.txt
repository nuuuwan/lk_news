NPP presents ‘sweeping economic revitalization strategy’ for SL

In response to Sri Lanka’s persistent economic challenges, aggravated by decades of structural issues, the National People’s Power (NPP) has presented a sweeping economic revitalization strategy aimed at steering the country towards stability and sustainable growth, specialist in the field of Data Science and Manufacturing Chathuranga Abeysinghe said.

NPP Executive Member Abeysinghe speaking at a discussion organized by the Sri Lanka Chamber of Small and Medium Industries (SLCMI) on the topic, “Emerging from the Economic Crisis and Industrial Policy”, at the Marino Beach Hotel on July 24 said that at the core of the NPP’s ambitious vision is a comprehensive approach to address key issues plaguing the economy.

Abeysinghe added: ‘These include fiscal consolidation, debt sustainability and the rejuvenation of critical industries essential for long-term prosperity. The strategy underscores the urgency of tackling these challenges through strategic reforms designed to create a conducive environment for economic expansion.

‘One of the cornerstone initiatives announced by the NPP is the establishment of a specialized relief bank to manage non-performing loans within the Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) sector. This initiative aims to alleviate financial burdens on struggling businesses, allowing commercial banks to refocus on supporting new and viable enterprises.

‘The NPP has outlined plans for a significant overhaul of Sri Lanka’s industrial policy, which includes measures to enhance clarity and stability for industrial development, improve market efficiency, upgrade infrastructure and promote technological innovation across key sectors.

‘These reforms are intended to bolster Sri Lanka’s competitiveness in global markets and attract much-needed foreign investment.

‘Digital transformation also features prominently in the NPP’s agenda, recognizing its critical role in improving government efficiency and transparency.

‘My party has committed to implementing robust digital initiatives supported by strong leadership, clear communication strategies and capacity-building efforts within the government workforce.

‘Addressing governance and corruption issues is another crucial aspect of the NPP’s strategy. By promoting transparency and accountability, the party aims to create a more accountable political environment conducive to sustainable economic development.

‘The unveiling of this comprehensive economic plan marks a significant turning point in Sri Lanka’s efforts to navigate its current economic crisis. The NPP’s vision emphasizes inclusive growth, aiming to reduce poverty and regional disparities while fostering a more equitable distribution of economic benefits.

‘As Sri Lanka embarks on this ambitious path towards economic renewal, the success of these initiatives will depend on collaborative efforts from government, industry stakeholders and civil society.

‘The NPP’s commitment to structural reforms and strategic interventions offers hope for a brighter economic future, promising enhanced stability, prosperity and improved living standards for all Sri Lankans.’
