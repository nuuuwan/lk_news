Sri Lanka micro-finance bill challenged by community organizations

ECONOMYNEXT – A planned bill to regulate micro-finance organizations has been challenged in the Supreme Court by traditional community organizations which provide savings and credit, according to a statement.

The proposed bill  is “intrusive and violate the autonomy of community organisations such as Death Donations and Welfare Societies, Sarvodaya Shramadana Societies and Women’s Organisations engaged in community savings and credit providing activities for generations before modern micro-finance began,” they say.

The community based organizations have also complained that larger finance companies which also provide micro-finance and where concerns have been raised about “predatory lending”, appear to be excluded.

Regulating for the sake of regulating will harm these community-based initiatives and trample on low-income people’s autonomy and traditional rights to organise their credit services, petitioners have said.

They also say that the proposed Bill falls short of protecting microfinance victims as it lacks legal enforcement.

Community-based credit providers, too, have also raised the issue of big finance companies in creating a “debt deluge by issuing ‘quick and easy’ loans to low-income women”. (Colombo/Jan24/2024)
