Massive money transferring scam from accounts without notice: MP reveals

Parliament, April 26 (Daily Mirror)- A massive scam is being operated where money is transferred from current and savings accounts to other multiple accounts without any notice to the account holder, an Opposition MP revealed in Parliament.

MP Gamini Waleboda told Parliament that people have complained that money from their current and savings accounts have been transferred to multiple other accounts within a day without the account holder getting any notification of the transfers.

He said people who had done online transactions had fallen victims to this scam.

The MP said Rs. 1.1 million from an account of a Buddhist monk from Balangoda had been transferred in this manner and it was found that a group of people who had been trained under an institute engaged in providing online transaction training were behind the scam.

He urged the House to report the matter to the Central Bank and look into it soon, claiming that money had been transferred from some 1000 accounts so far.
