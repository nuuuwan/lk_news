Ven. Gnanasara Thera admitted to Prison Hospital

Colombo, March 29 (Daily Mirror) - Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera who was sentenced to four years of rigorous imprisonment, has been admitted to the Prison Hospital, Prisons Spokesman Gamini Dissanayake said.

The Colombo High Court Judge Aditya Patabendige handed down the sentence on Thursday (March 28), following Ven. Gnanasara Thera's defamatory comments against Islam made in late 2016.

It was reported that Ven. Gnanasara Thera had been undergoing medical treatment prior to his sentencing and hence was referred to the Prison Hospital for treatment.
