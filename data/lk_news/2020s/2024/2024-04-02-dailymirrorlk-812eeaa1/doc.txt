Health strike called off

Colombo, April 02- The ongoing trade union action initiated by health sector workers has been called off following constructive discussions held earlier today at the Presidential Secretariat.

The decision to abort the indefinite strike comes after a meeting between representatives of the Health Trade Union Alliance and ministerial authorities yielded positive outcomes.

Originally scheduled for Monday, the crucial discussion was deferred to today, leading to concerns of an impending indefinite strike by unions affiliated to the Health Trade Union Alliance.

However, the meeting convened at the Presidential Secretariat earlier today concluded on a positive note, fostering agreement and understanding among the parties involved.

The trade unions had previously announced plans for an indefinite strike starting tomorrow (03) in response to unresolved grievances.

However, in light of the constructive dialogue and promising developments during today's meeting, the health sector trade unions have unanimously decided to halt the proposed strike action.

Prior to this decision, health workers staged a 4-hour strike at 10 selected hospitals beginning at 6.30 a.m. today (02) to amplify their demands and draw attention to pressing issues within the sector.
