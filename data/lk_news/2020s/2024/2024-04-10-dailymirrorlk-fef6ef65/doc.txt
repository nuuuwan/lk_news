SLCERT engineersâ€™ reports to be sent to Education Minister today

Colombo, April 10 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (SLCERT) Senior Information Security Engineer Charuka Damunupola today revealed that a report will be sent to the Education Minister regarding the recent hacking of the Education Ministry's official website.

He said the initial investigations launched by the SLCERT indicate that the hack was carried out by a local individual.

The detailed findings of the hack will be forwarded to the Minister, who will then pass a copy to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) for further investigations to apprehend the culprit.

It has been noted that necessary security patches and updates were not applied to the website, and the Ministry had failed to conduct a Vulnerability Assessment (VA), despite being advised to do so annually by SLCERT.

SLCERT has recommended that the Ministry should launch a new website with updated security measures instead of reinstating the compromised one. However, the current website will be restored with basic features either today or tomorrow.

The website was hacked on April 4. The hacker, purportedly identifying as "Anonymous EEE," managed to gain unauthorized access to the site, leaving behind a message warning of security vulnerabilities.

The message left by the hacker read, "My name is Anonymous EEE and I am currently studying AI. Sorry for unauthorized access to your website, but your website has some security flaws. As a Sri Lankan citizen, I am reporting this for the safety of my country. Fix it, thanks."
