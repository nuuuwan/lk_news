Sri Lanka to join US-led International Counter Ransomware Initiative

Sri Lanka has received an invitation to join the inaugural International Counter Ransomware Initiative, which the United States has started as a common platform in 2021 with a group of other countries for international coordination to eliminate ransomware, the government said.

So far, 48 countries around the world and the European Union as well as the International Police (Interpol) have joined the initiative.

Since Sri Lanka has recently faced various problems due to ransomware, it has been recognized that it can benefit from joining the International Counter Ransomware Initiative, the Govt. Information Department said.

Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved the joint proposal presented by the President in his capacity as the Minister of Technology and Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms to join the International Counter Ransomware Initiative and taking further action.
