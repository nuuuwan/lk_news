Epitome of administrative excellence

The late Ray Forbes encompassed within himself administrative excellence and profound humanity. On account of these rare qualities he endeared himself to the staff and students of the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies (BCIS), Colombo, for well over a decade.

The above sentiments were expressed with regard to the former Director of the BCIS, Ray Forbes, by every speaker who was invited to comment on his life and times at a special commomerative ceremony held at the BCIS auditorium on March 7th. The event was presided over by the Chairperson of the BCIS, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.

Among the attendees at the simple but august ceremony were senior members of the BCIS management, diplomats, members of the BCIS staff, past and present, and former and present students of the BCIS.

Among those who addressed the gathering were, Executive Director of the BCIS, Prof. Gamini Keerawella, former Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Amb. G. Wijesiri, a former Deputy Director of the BCIS, Ms. Rohini Weerasinghe and Deputy General Manager HR, Commercial Bank of Ceylon and BCIS alumni, Isuru Tillakawardena. The Vote of Thanks was delivered by Dr. Nishara Mendis, Director Research, BCIS.

Ray Forbes was Director of the BCIS from 1983 until 1997. He joined the BCIS after considerable years of service in the Sri Lanka Foreign Service. Forbes’ tenure at the BCIS was characterized by administrative finesse, excellence and efficiency. He was the recipient of a Lifetime Service Award for his services to the BCIS in 2017.

While Ray Forbes’ rare administrative acumen and efficacy came in for adulation at the commmeration in ample measure, all speakers were particularly emphatic about his humanity and empathy. He was a stickler for discipline but had a warm heart within him at all times. He gave an attentive ear to the problems of students and went more than the extra mile to help them out of their difficulties.

Ray Forbes was an embodiment of ‘simple living and high thinking’. For example, before joining the BCIS, Forbes, for some time, served in the movement initiated by the illustrious Mother Theresa of Calcutta to serve the sick and destitute of the world. While this gift of humanity was amply manifest during his tenure at the BCIS, its efflorescence was also visible during retirement.

Rather than choose the relatively convenient climes of Colombo or its suburbs, Forbes chose to retire to Anuradhapura where he spent the rest of his years teaching rural students English and music, free of charge. Thus, Ray Forbes finely mixed administrative expertise, efficiency, humanity and selflessness. His was a life well lived.
