Agency owner, and manager further remanded over illegal recruitment of Sri Lankans to Russian army

The owner and the manager of a licensed foreign employment agency who were arrested and remanded for allegedly sending Sri Lankans for employment in the Russian army to fight in the Ukraine war, have been further remanded until July 13.

The order was issued when the relevant case was taken up before the Negombo Magistrate’s Court today (30).

Based on 07 complaints received regarding the racket operated by the agency, the two suspects were arrested by officers of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment’s (SLBFE) Special Investigations Unit (SIU) on May 15.

It is claimed that the agency had obtained a sum of Rs. 1.5 million from each individual after promising that they would be sent to Russia on tourist visas and given employment in the Russian army’s civil service.

Based on those complaints, the agency is believed to have cheated a total sum of over Rs. 10 million.
