Cabinet nod to introduce hybrid parliamentary electoral system

Colombo, March 20 (Daily Mirror) - The Cabinet endorsed a proposal to draft constitutional amendments for the introduction of a new parliamentary electoral system that will enable the election of 160 MPs under the previous First-Past-the â€“Post System and the remainder under proportional representation, Daily Mirror learns.

Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe presented the proposal approved by the Cabinet. A new piece of legislation will be drafted for enactment by Parliament giving effect to the constitutional changes required for the purpose. It will be a hybrid electoral system.

In the past, the successive governments attempted to bring changes to the current electoral system which is solely based on proportional representation and preferential voting.
