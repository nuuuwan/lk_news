Maithripala to be charged for contempt of court?

Colombo, May 30 (Daily Mirror) - A contempt of court application has been filed before the Court of Appeal against former President Maithripala Sirisena for allegedly disregarding an order made by the Colombo District Court regarding the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) chairmanship.

SLFP activist Montague Sarathchandra filed this application seeking an order to punish Maithripala Sirisena for the offence of contempt of court for alleged violation of the interim injunction issued by the Colombo District Court on April 24, 2024.

The Colombo District Court had issued an interim injunction on April 24, preventing former President Maithripala Sirisena from functioning as the chairman of the SLFP.

The petitioner alleged that despite the Colombo District Court's interim injunction, respondent Sirisena purported to style himself and function as the Chairman of the SLFP till May 12, 2024.

The petitioner stated that on May 12, 2024, Maithripala Sirisena had addressed a letter to Deputy Secretary of the SLFP Sarath Ekanayake citing his resignation from the office of chairman. The petitioner further stated that according to this letter Sirisena said that he discharged the responsibilities of the office of chairman of SLFP until his resignation on May 12, 2024.

He further alleged that the respondent has brought the authority of the District Court and the administration of justice into disrespect or disregard.

When this matter was called before the Court of Appeal two-judge-bench comprising Justices Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Shashi Mahendran, the petitioner was directed to serve notice on the respondent party.

Senior Counsel Shantha Jayawardena instructed by Dinesh de Silva appeared for the petitioner.
