Shanaka takes 4 as Sri Lanka ease past Ireland

Former captain Dasun Shanaka bagged a four-wicket haul as Sri Lanka avoided a scare to win comprehensively against Ireland in their T20 World Cup warm-up match played at Lauderhill, Florida, yesterday.

After being invited to bat first, Sri Lanka made a steady start but lost two wickets in the fourth over as Josh Little claimed a quickfire double breakthrough, with Kusal Mendis followed back to the pavilion by namesake Kamindu.

Captain Wanindu Hasaranga (26) and Shanaka (23) made starts, but Ireland’s attack remained disciplined, and Sri Lanka were wobbling on 125 for seven when the latter fell to Barry McCarthy (2/31).

Angelo Mathews called on all his experience with an unbeaten 32 to steer his side to a competitive total of 163/8 in their 20 overs. Barry McCarthy (2/31) and Josh Little (2/45) claimed two wickets each.

In reply, Ireland started off brightly, with Andy Balbirnie (16) and Paul Stirling (21) both falling with the score on 39. Hasaranga and Shanaka helped disrupt Ireland’s momentum in the middle overs. Curtis Campher top-scored with a run-a-ball 26, but Ireland ultimately fell short, bowled out for 122 in 18.2 overs to lose by 41 runs. Shanaka wrapped it up, finishing with four for 23 from 3.2 overs. Maheesh Theekshana (2/41) and Hasaranga (2/40) also picked up two wickets each. (Agencies)
