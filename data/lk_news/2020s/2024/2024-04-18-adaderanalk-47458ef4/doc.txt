Hotline numbers to provide information regarding environmental damage

Sri Lanka Police says the general public can provide any information regarding environmental destruction via the hotline numbers ‘1997’ and ‘1981’.

Police said steps have been taken to inform people regarding the matter, since the information provided by the general public plays a major role in operations carried out in relation to environmental destruction.

The illegal mining activities, environmental damage caused by factories and sound pollution have had a severe impact on the environment and wild animals.

Accordingly, the hotline numbers ‘1997’ of the Police Special Bureau and ‘1981’ of Central Environment Authority (CEA) has been introduced in order to receive information and complaints regarding such environmental damages caused by people, the police said.
