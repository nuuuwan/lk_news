Fonseka’s lawsuit against SJB: Court rejects Sajith’s objections

Colombo, March 19 (Daily Mirror) - The Colombo District Court today rejected the objections raised by Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leader Sajith Premadasa, against the enjoining order which prevented the SJB from removing Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka from his party membership and positions.

Accordingly, Colombo District Court Judge Sandun Vithana further extended its enjoining order preventing the SJB from removing Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka from party membership and positions till April 2.

Sarath Fonseka had obtained an enjoining order, preventing the SJB from removing him on the basis of remarks he made against offering party membership to former Army Commander Daya Ratnayake.

Faiszer Musthapha PC with Shaheeda Barrie, Mehran Careem, Pulasthi Rupasinghe and Amila Perera appeared for the plaintiff, while President’s Counsel Romesh De Silva with Farman Cassim PC appeared for SJB leader Sajith Premadasa.
