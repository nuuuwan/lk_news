Maithripala prevented from functioning as SLFP chairman until trial ends

The Colombo District Court has delivered a permanent injunction preventing former President Maithripala Sirisena from functioning as the chairman of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).

The order was issued with regard to a plaint filed by SLFP executive committee member Montague Sarathchandra.

Accordingly, the permanent injunction will be effective until the conclusion of the trial.

This is the second order issued by the Colombo District Court, barring Sirisena from functioning as the SLFP chairman. The previous court order was delivered with respect to a case filed by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.
