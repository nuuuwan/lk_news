International spotlight on presidential election

Colombo, May 31 (Daily Mirror) - The International spotlight is already cast on the conduct of the upcoming presidential election in Sri Lanka with the European Union already deploying its experts for a pre-election assessment of the ground situation, an official said yesterday.

Election observers are usually deployed to monitor national elections in Sri Lanka. They also carry out pre-poll assessments to ascertain whether a free and fair electoral process is ensured in the country.

However, it assumes special significance this year because Sri Lanka is going to implement the Campaign Finance Act to monitor electoral expenses of candidates for the first time.

The implementation of the new law was also a recommendation by the EU experts who monitored elections in Sri Lanka in the past.

Election Commission’s Chairman R. M. A. L. Ratnayake confirmed that the EU delegation met with him.

“The delegation was supposed to meet with other stakeholders for their pre-election assessment of the situation. They inquired about the implementation of the new law as well,” he said.

Once the election is declared, he said a team of experts will be in the country to monitor the conduct of elections.
