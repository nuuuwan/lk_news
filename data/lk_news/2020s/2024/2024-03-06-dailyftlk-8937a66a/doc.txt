Cabinet approves enhanced meal budget for School Food Program

Increases ‘School Food Program’ allocation from Rs. 85 to Rs. 110 per meal

Save the Children organisation pledges to provide 3 food items to 200,000 students in 917 selected schools in 2024

The Cabinet of Ministers approved to increase the budget allocated for student meals under the ‘School Food Program’ from Rs. 85 to Rs. 110 per meal.

The move was made after considering the rise in food prices. “It has been deemed necessary to raise the allocation to Rs. 110 to maintain the quality and nutritional value of the meals provided,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

A committee of officers tasked with examining the matter concluded that an amount of Rs. 110 is required to cover the costs adequately amidst price fluctuations. As a result, the Cabinet has approved this adjustment to ensure that students receive wholesome meals that meet their nutritional needs.

The decision aims to ensure that students in the primary division receive nutritious meals throughout the academic year, with the program set to be implemented for 170 days in 2024. The School Food Program will benefit students across 7,902 schools spanning 100 education zones countrywide, catering to a total student population of 1.08 million.

In addition, he said the School Food Program will receive support from Save the Children organisation, which has pledged to provide three food items to 200,000 students in 917 selected schools for the year 2024.

“The enhanced budget allocation and collaboration with Save the Children organisation are significant steps towards ensuring that more students have access to nutritious meals during their school day. The collaborative effort will further enhance the reach and impact of the program,” he added.
