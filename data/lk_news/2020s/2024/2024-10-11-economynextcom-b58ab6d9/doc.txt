ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has condemned an Israeli attack at the headquarters of United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) which injured two Sri Lankan UN peacekeepers, the island nation’s Foreign Ministry said.

“Sri Lanka strongly condemns the attack at UNIFIL’s headquarters in Naqoura, South Lebanon injuring two Sri Lankan UN peacekeepers,” the Ministry said in a statement.

“Sri Lanka upholds the obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and inviolability of UN premises at all times.”

The Foreign Ministry said the Sri Lanka Embassy in Beirut is in contact with UNIFIL regarding the medical attention and speedy recovery of the Sri Lankan peacekeepers.

“Sri Lanka values the brave contribution of its UN peacekeepers worldwide.”

The attack is the second on the same location in the last 48 hours, Al Jazeera reported.

The Israeli military has said in a statement it is conducting a thorough review of the incident where two peacekeepers were “inadvertently” hurt in southern Lebanon, foreign media reported.

The Israeli military later said two personnel with the UN peacekeeping mission were wounded when Israeli forces responded to a threat.

Lebanon’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs was quoted earlier that the attacks were on watchtowers and the main UNIFIL base in Naqoura and on the Sri Lankan battalion’s base.   (Colombo/October 11/2024)
