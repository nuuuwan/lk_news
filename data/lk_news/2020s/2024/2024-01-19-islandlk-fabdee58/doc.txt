Southbeach Weligama, Silver Sponsor at Galle Literary Festival 2024

Southbeach Weligama (SBW), Weligama makes its debut at the Galle Literary Festival 2024 to be held from the 25th to the 28th of January as a Silver Sponsor. Heralded as ‘The World’s No 1 Literary Festival’ by Harper’s Bazaar as one of the most exciting arts-focused events in South Asia, SBW weighs in with author Alexander McCall Smith and a panel discussion that discusses the rise of Sri Lankan cuisine. This discussion brings together multi-award winner – British food writer and restaurant critic Tom Parker Bowles, co-founder of award-winning restaurant Smoke & Bitters Lahiru Perera and restaurateur and award-winning author of the cookbook ‘Rambutan’ Cynthia Shanmugalingam.

In tandem with the Festival, SBW will place a contemporary installation running the length of Hall de Galle, a venue central to GLF and where Alexander McCall Smith will be speaking on ‘One Hundred Books and Counting’ on the 27th of January. The installation is reflective of SBW’s inherent persona – contemporary and avant-garde with a touch of the abstract that embraces the chic canvas of modern beachfront living.
