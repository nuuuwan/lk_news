’We are close to each other’: Champika and Mano

Colombo, Feb 29 (Daily Mirror) -  The United Republic Front and the Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) are very close to each other and hold common ideologies most of the time, the leaders of the two parties said.

United Republic Front leader Patali Champika Ranawaka and TPA leader Mano Ganesan came up with this common remark while speaking to journalists after a meeting they held in Colombo.

MP Ranawaka met MP Ganesan at the latter's residence in Pamankada this morning.

The two leaders said they are close to each other when journalists questioned them as to whether Ranawaka is forging a new alliance to face  future elections.

"We sit next to each other in Parliament and exchange ideas. We have common ideologies most of the time. Wex like the TPA, feel that the plantation commimity is isolated and one of the groups which are mostly affected by the current economic crisis," Ranawaka said.

"We want to establish a common national programme for the sake of the nation," he added.

MP Ganesan also said his party and the party led by MP Ranawaka are close to each other. Ranawaka also understands the plight of the plantation sector workers. We will support anyone who resolves these issues," MP Ganesan said.
