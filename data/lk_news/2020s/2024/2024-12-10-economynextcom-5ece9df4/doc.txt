Sri Lanka to find better uses for five extra Presidential palaces

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has appointed a committee to find better use for 5 presidential palaces and 50 bungalows in Colombo 7 and 5 areas, a statement from the President’s media office said.

Out of seven Presidential Palaces only the ones in Colombo and Kandy are used regularly, the statement said.

The other five were in Nuwara Eliya, Mahiyangana, Anuradhapura, Kataragama, Jaffna, Embilipitya and Bentota.

Visumapaya, a building in Colombo coming under the Urban Development Authority, which is used by visiting foreign dignitaries, has also been included in the list of under-utilized buildings that can be better made use of.

There were 50 bungalows in Colombo coming under the public administration ministry. They were used by ex-presidents and ministers.

The cabinet has approved the appointment of a committee of officials to come up with plans to make better use of the buildings.

There were reports in 2023 that a Presidential Palace built in Jaffna by ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa would be leased to an IT university. (Colombo/Dec10/2024)
