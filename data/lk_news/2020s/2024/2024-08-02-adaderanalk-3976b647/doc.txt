Sri Lankans advised not to visit Lebanon in next few days

Sri Lankans have been advised not to visit Lebanon during the next few days, unless for essential purposes, Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry said.

This advice comes amid rising tensions in the region following the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.

When inquired by Ada Derana, the Minister also expressed that there are around 6,000 Sri Lankans currently residing in Lebanon.

Meanwhile on Thursday (01), Minister Sabry emphasized that the government has a plan in place to repatriate Sri Lankan expatriate workers in Iran and its region in the event the conflict escalates to violence.

He also affirmed that the President has appointed two committees to monitor this situation and to take necessary measures.

“We already had a plan in place for this situation in October, which we are now reviewing. In the event that the conflict escalates, we have a plan to take immediate action to safeguard the lives of Sri Lankans in the region”, he highlighted.

Meanwhile, the minister urged Sri Lankans not to seek foreign employment with visit visas, citing the recent predicament of Sri Lankans in Myanmar and Russia who failed to follow the proper channels for foreign employment.
