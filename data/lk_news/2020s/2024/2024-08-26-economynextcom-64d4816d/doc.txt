Sri Lanka’s income tax agency’s 2024 collection exceeds targets so far

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s income tax agency has exceeded its monthly targets so far in 2024 and is expected to achieve the full-year target comfortably, a top official said.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s government has set an ambitious tax revenue target of 2,024 billion rupee for the Inland Revenue Department for this year, 30 percent higher than last year’s total collection of 1,550 billion rupees.

The IRD has collected 1,224 billion rupees, 60 percent of the 2024 target, as of August 22, the provisional IRD data showed.

“We have exceeded the target in the first half,” B.K. Saman Shantha, Deputy Commissioner General​ in charge of Tax Policy, International Affairs and Legal at the  IRD told reporters at a media briefing in Colombo.

“The first six month target is 40 percent of the full-year target and the rest of the 60 percent is collected from the second half of the year due to seasonal patterns,” he explained.

The IRD has achieved 103 percent of the target set for the first half of this year, the data showed.

He said the state revenue collection body will achieve this year’s target and there is a possibility of exceeding the target.

“We expect the highest collection for this month and it will be more than 200 billion rupees,” Shantha told EconomyNext. (Colombo/August 26/2024)
