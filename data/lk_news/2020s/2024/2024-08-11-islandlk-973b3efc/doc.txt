The public transport nightmare: possible remedies via digitization and mechanization

Across Sri Lanka from north to south, an astonishing 90% of the population relies on public transport for their daily commutes. This widespread dependence underscores a critical issue: public transport, particularly on private buses, is the source of significant physical and mental strain for many. The reality is stark; private bus services are marked by a host of problems that contribute to a deteriorating passenger experience.

The challenges are multifaceted and impact every aspect of bus travel. Boarding and alighting from buses can be a stressful experience with passengers often battling overcrowded conditions and poorly designed bus entry and exit points. Once on board, the issues continue.

Reckless driving and abrupt braking by drivers frequently compromise passenger safety, creating hazardous conditions on the road. Additionally, the lack of decorum and respect to passengers by conductors and drivers exacerbates the situation, with rude behavior to outright neglect an everyday situation.

The buses themselves are uncomfortable with many vehicles lacking adequate seating resulting in cramped and uncomfortable journeys. Despite existing regulations and schedules, buses often run late, and efforts to address these delays through complaints to transport authorities are often futile.

The systemic problems are so entrenched that they seem resistant to reform. Addressing these issues requires more than just listing them—it calls for a fundamental overhaul of the public transport system. The current approach, heavily reliant on physical regulation and susceptible to corruption, is failing. Inspectors from the Public Transport Authority often take bribes undermining effective regulation and perpetuating a cycle of misconduct.

Respect for passengers and basic decency are rare. Conductors often demand exact change or levy incorrect fares. Common grievances include conductors telling passengers to “stay here” or making excuses for not having change. Fare and change issues are significant and demand urgent attention.

To truly resolve these problems mechanization and digitization covering the entire public transport network is needed. While electronic payment cards offer a partial solution, they alone cannot tackle the full range of issues.

A proposed solution is the development of an integrated app that manages all aspects of bus transport services. This would serve multiple functions, including real-time tracking of buses, fare management, and route planning. By integrating all stakeholders—passengers, conductors, drivers, bus owners, and transport authorities—the app could address the most pressing issues in public transport.

One of the major issues with the current system is the lack of real-time information about bus arrivals. Passengers are often left waiting at bus stops without knowing when the next bus will arrive or its current location. The proposed app could provide this crucial information, allowing passengers to plan their journeys more effectively and reduce unnecessary waiting.

Additionally, the app could offer detailed information about bus routes and destinations. This feature would prevent passengers from waiting at wrong stops and help them make informed decisions about their travel plans. It would also enable bus drivers and conductors to manage their schedules more effectively, improving overall efficiency.

By digitizing fare transactions and incorporating features like real-time bus tracking, the app would significantly enhance the efficiency of public transport services. Passengers would no longer need to engage in adversarial interactions with conductors over fares, and the need to carry cash would be eliminated. This would reduce the common problem of passengers being unprepared with the correct fare and decrease instances of misconduct by conductors.

For bus owners, the app would provide valuable data on bus operations and revenue. This information would help in monitoring performance and identifying areas for improvement. Furthermore, the app would assist in managing increased demand by allowing transport authorities to schedule additional buses for high-demand areas.

The app would also streamline the process for reporting and addressing illegal or disciplinary issues involving drivers and conductors. Current practices, where complaints are often delayed or ignored, would be replaced by a system that enables immediate communication and action. This would enhance accountability and improve the overall quality of service.

Developing such an app is within the capabilities of local IT, computing, social media, and software experts. However, successful implementation requires strong government commitment. The government must initiate and support the necessary steps to develop and deploy the app, ensuring that it addresses the core issues of public transport in Sri Lanka.

The benefits of this digital transformation are clear. It would alleviate physical discomfort and mental stress for passengers, improve operational efficiency, and contribute to environmental sustainability. Passengers, bus owners, and transport authorities alike would experience the positive impact of a modernized public transport system.

As Lankans continue to endure hardships on buses, there is a growing demand for a solution that can genuinely improve their daily commutes. The introduction of a comprehensive digital app represents a promising step towards achieving that goal.
