Heat advisory: Temperatures to reach ‘Caution’ level in some areas tomorrow

Heat index, the temperature felt on human body, is expected to increase up to ‘Caution’ level in parts of the Northern and North-Western provinces and Anuradhapura District on Friday (12).

Issuing an advisory, the Meteorology Department cautioned that heat cramps and heat exhaustion; continued activity could result in heatstroke.

The Heat Index Forecast is calculated by using relative humidity and maximum temperature and this is the condition that is felt on the human body, says the Meteorology Department.

The department further says this is not the forecast of maximum temperature. It is generated by the Department of Meteorology for the next day period and prepared by using global numerical weather prediction model data, the advisory further read.
