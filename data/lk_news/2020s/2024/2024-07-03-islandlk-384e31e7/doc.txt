Fadna Vernolac Prospective Scholarship Program commences

Cancer has become a significant health problem in today’s world. Currently, more than 30,000 new cases are reported annually in Sri Lanka, worsening the situation. This rapidly growing cancer has become a source of financial and mental stress not only for the patients but also for their family members.

We can see many cases where students from affected families face problems in their educational journey due to psychological distress, increased responsibilities at home, and economic difficulties. Accordingly, Fadna Institute has committed to using the profit from its Vernolac product to brighten the future of these students by encouraging them to take the A-level examination, which is a valuable milestone in their lives.

The signing of the cooperation agreement named The Fadna Vernolac Prospective Scholarship Program took place on May 25, 2024, at the Gangarama Rajamaha Vihara, in the presence of all religious leaders, with the grant from Fadna Institute and the cooperation of the Moratuwa New Horizon Lions Club.

Fadna, a renowned brand that has won the trust of its customers for over two decades, among the four latest products introduced in collaboration with the University of Colombo, allocates its share of the revenue from Vernolac to the Fadna Vernolac Aspirational Scholarship Program, further advancing its social responsibility.
