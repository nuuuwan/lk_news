Ex-president Maithripala reveals SLFP’s presidential candidate

The censured Chairman of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) former President Maithripala Sirisena says that Minister Wijayadasa Rajapakshe will be the SLFP’s presidential candidate in the upcoming election.

Joining the commemoration ceremony of the late T.B. Ilangaratne, Sirsena assured that Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has the support of the majority of the party members.

“I have previously served as President and pledged not to contest for the presidency again. Mr. Wijayadasa will run in the upcoming presidential election, and we will offer him our full support”, he said.

“We took a minister from the ruling party, who is now aligned with us. He no longer desires the ministerial position”, the former President added.
