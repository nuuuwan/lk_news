The hearing of petitions against the ATA begins

COLOMBO (News 1st); The hearing of 29 petitions challenging the Anti-Terrorism Bill submitted by the government to Parliament began today.

The five-judge bench comprises Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya, Vijith Malalgoda, A.H.M.D. Nawaz, Shiran Gunaratne, and Arjuna Obeysekera.

The petitions argue that certain clauses of the proposed bill violate basic human rights and call for a two-thirds majority vote in Parliament and a referendum before the bill can be passed.
