Pathirana reverts Keheliyaâ€™s decision

Colombo, Feb 15 (Daily Mirror) - Prof. Jayantha Jayawardana, a former member of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) has been reinstated as an SLMC member after being removed by former Minister of Health Keheliya Rambukwella without due cause.

The reappointment has been made by Minister of Health Dr. Ramesh Pathirana.

Accordingly, the term of office for the reappointed member, is set for five years, unless voluntarily resigned or removed as per the ordinance.

Expressing gratitude for the reinstatement, Prof. Jayawardana highlighted the unlawful and arbitrary nature of his previous termination. He assumed duties yesterday, February 14, 2024.

Prof Jayawardana was removed as the SLMC Vice President last October without citing reasonable reasons.

The decision by the former Minister of Health was criticized for its lack of valid reasoning and its violation of the principles of natural justice.

Prof. Jayawardana's credentials reflect extensive experience and leadership roles in the field of Obstetrics and Gynecology, as well as in academic and administrative positions within Sri Lanka's medical education and healthcare system.
