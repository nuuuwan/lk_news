Govt ready to discuss progress of IMF program,  creditors’ talks with opposition - State Minister

The government says it is ready to discuss with the opposition the progress of the discussions with Sri Lanka’s creditors and the programme of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Taking to ‘X’ (formerly Twitter), State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe revealed that as per the request made by Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Dr. Harsha de Silva, the government is willing to provide any additional information in this regard, however, he added that they “will not be able to disclose any market sensitive information”.

“Although the opposition deliberately missed out the discussion facilitated with good faith on alternative proposals including debt restructuring, the government is once again ready to facilitate another opportunity”, Semasinghe said, emphasizing the importance for the opposition too, to act in good faith.
