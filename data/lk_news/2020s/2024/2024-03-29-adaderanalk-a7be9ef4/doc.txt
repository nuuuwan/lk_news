Sri Lankan delegation attends Assembly of Inter-Parliamentary Union in Geneva

A delegation of the Parliament of Sri Lanka led by the Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena attended the 148th Assembly of Inter-Parliamentary Union held in Geneva from 23-27 March.

The delegation comprised MPs Ranjith Madduma Bandara, Ashok Abeysinghe, Sumith Udukumbura, Manjula Dissanayake, as well as Secretary General of Parliament Kushani Rohanadeera.

Addressing the General Debate under the theme “Parliamentary diplomacy: Building bridges for peace and understanding” Abeywardena has pointed out that parliamentary diplomacy acts as a bridge between governments and citizens, ensuring that the concerns and perspectives of the people are taken into account in the formulation of foreign policies.

The Sri Lankan Speaker has also stated that in recent times, parliamentary diplomacy has gained prominence as a tool for conflict prevention and resolution. By facilitating dialogue and understanding between nations at the legislative level, parliamentary diplomats contribute to creating an environment conducive to peaceful coexistence, he added.

The Speaker has further mentioned that, parliamentary diplomacy is an important perspective and alternative form of diplomacy. Even if not widely studied yet, parliamentary diplomacy has developed lately by the increasing role of Parliaments and their enrolment in foreign affairs and issues related to international relations.

Focusing on the experiences of the Parliament of Sri Lanka, the Speaker has pointed out that Sri Lanka joined Inter-Parliamentary Union on 9th Feb 1949. Since then, Sri Lanka actively participated in IPU assemblies and Sri Lanka had the opportunity to host several seminars and workshops of IPU in the past, the speaker added.

Further, the Sectoral Oversight Committee on International Relations and Consultative Committee on Ministry of  Foreign Affairs have wide mandates to inquire into all aspects of foreign policy, to examine legislation referred to them as well as the expenditure estimates of departments and agencies that are implementing foreign policy, Abeywardena has said further in his address.

During the assembly, the Sri Lankan lawmakers attended the Standing Committee on Democracy and Human Rights, Standing Committee on Peace and International Security, Standing Committee on Sustainable Development and Forum of Women Parliamentarians and shared their experiences and knowledge.
