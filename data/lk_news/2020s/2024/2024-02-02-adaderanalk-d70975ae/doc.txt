UN Human Rights Office calls for amending Sri Lanka’s new online safety laws

The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) states that Sri Lanka’s new Online Safety Act will have far reaching negative implications for human rights, including freedom of expression.

Posing on X (formerly Twitter), the UN Human Rights Office urged the Government of Sri Lanka to consider amending the relevant law to address concerns of civil society and industry groups and ensure that it complies with human rights obligations.
