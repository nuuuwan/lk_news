FACTBOX – Sri Lanka’s past presidential elections, results

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka closed polling for the presidential election at 1600 hours on Saturday (21) amid a tight race among the top three candidates: President Ranil Wickremesinghe, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, and Marxists party leader Anura Kumara Dissanayaka.

Analysts expect the winner to be chosen after second preferential vote counting for the first time in Sri Lankan history because no candidate is expected to secure more than 50 percent.

Here’s a list of all the Sri Lankan Presidential Election results since the establishment of the executive presidency in 1978:

Main Opponent: Hector Kobbekaduwa (Sri Lanka Freedom Party – SLFP)

This was the first presidential election in Sri Lanka, and Jayewardene was the incumbent prime minister who became the country’s first executive president in 1978.

Main Opponent: Sirimavo Bandaranaike (Sri Lanka Freedom Party – SLFP)

Premadasa became the second executive president, and the election was held amid a backdrop of civil war and Marxists-Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)-led insurrection.

Winner: Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga (People’s Alliance – PA, a coalition led by SLFP)

Kumaratunga became the first female executive president of Sri Lanka.

Kumaratunga was the first president to be re-elected for a second term through election after surviving an assassination attempt just days before the election.

Winner: Mahinda Rajapaksa (United People Freedom Alliance (UPFA), a coalition led by SLFP)

Rajapaksa won his first term in office amid the ongoing civil war and an election boycott by ethnic minority Tamils in the country’s war-hit Northern and Eastern province.

Winner: Mahinda Rajapaksa (United People’s Freedom Alliance – UPFA, led by SLFP)

Rajapaksa secured re-election after winning the civil war, defeating his own Army General Fonseka.

Winner: Maithripala Sirisena (United National Front – UNF, a coalition led by UNP)

Main Opponent: Mahinda Rajapaksa (United People’s Freedom Alliance – UPFA)

Sirisena, a former ally of Rajapaksa, ran on a reformist platform and defeated his own leader Rajapaksa after accusing rampant corruption.
