Presidential Election 2024: Notice for postal voting applicants

The applications to cast postal votes must be handed over to District Returning Officers on or before August 05, the Election Commission announced.

Accordingly, all applications of the postal voting applicants must be forwarded to the relevant District Returning Officers through the District Election Office address.

The commission announced that the application forms to be completed for availing the postal voting facility can be obtained free of charge from the places where the voters’ lists are displayed, from the district election offices and also from the website of the Election Commission.

Furthermore, the Election Commission informs the general public that the applications must be received by the respective District Election Offices before 12.00 midnight on August 05, which is the last day of applications receipt and mere delivery of applications by post on that day is not a reason for acceptance of applications.
