Recent fuel price revision shows which sections of society affected most

Colombo, April 1 (Daily Mirror) - The recent reduction of Petrol 95 Octane by Rs.7 and super diesel by Rs. 72 shows which sections of society were most affected by the economic difficulties, All-Island Three-Wheeler Driversâ€™ Union (AITWDU) President Lalith Dharmasekera said.

While criticising the recent fuel price revision, he said the people who use super diesel were affected the most by the economic difficulties.

"However, based on the fuel revision formula, the decision-makers chose not to lower the prices of auto diesel and petrol 92 Octane. They reasoned that since most passenger services heavily rely on auto diesel and many three-wheeler operators use petrol 92 Octane, they believed that people who depend on these fuels will somehow manage to endure any hardships that may arise," he said.

"We haven't been fortunate enough to receive fuel concessions from the government. It seems they've focused more on addressing the challenges faced by those in higher socio-economic classes," he said.

Finally he appriciated Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera for not taking decision to reduce Auto Diesel and Petrol 92 Octane.

"This government shows the least concern for ordinary citizens and neglects their needs. Instead, it seems to exploit people's dissent for its own gain, maximizing its benefits without regard for the welfare of the populace," Dharmasekera said.

"However, it has come to our attention that this government is offering concessions primarily to the higher class citizens, with plans to extend these benefits to the lower class individuals at a later stage," he said.
