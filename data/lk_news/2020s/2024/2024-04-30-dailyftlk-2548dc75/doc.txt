BASL declines SJB invite to coordinate SJB – NPP debate

The Sri Lanka Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has unanimously decided to decline the invitation extended by the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) to serve as a mediator and coordinator in the planned debate between SJB leader Sajith Premadasa and National People’s Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

According to reports the decision to decline the invitation was made during a general meeting of the association held recently.  On 26 April, in a letter to the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) SJB MP Nalin Bandara invited it to act as an independent party to coordinate two planned debates between the rival parties.

BASL President Kaushalya Nawaratne PC had accepted the letter and informed Bandara that a decision would be reached after presenting it for consideration at a BASL general meeting.

Following this, the BASL has now opted against endorsing the debate. Their decision was rooted in the absence of a scheduled presidential election and the prevailing uncertainty regarding potential candidates.

The BASL has therefore emphasised that organising a debate featuring only two candidates posed significant challenges given the current circumstances.
