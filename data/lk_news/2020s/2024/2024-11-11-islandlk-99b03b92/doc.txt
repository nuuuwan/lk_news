A case for data-driven decision-making for plantations

In an era where sustainable agriculture has become a global priority, Dr. Chandra Embuldeniya, Honorary Fellow at the National Institute of Plantation Management and Founding Vice-Chancellor of Uva Wellassa University, addressed plantation professionals on the transformative potential of data-driven decision-making (DDDM) for plantation sustainability.

Speaking at the “Professional Members Day” hosted recently by the National Institute of Plantation Management, Embuldeniya outlined a path toward a resilient and efficient agricultural future, guided by precision technology and collaborative innovation.

Embuldeniya’s presentation, titled “Data-Driven Decision Making for Plantation Sustainability,” resonated with Sri Lanka’s agricultural leaders and policy makers. He emphasized that with global food demand on the rise, sustainable and efficient farming practices have become more essential than ever to conserve resources, protect ecosystems, and support biodiversity.

In this effort, he argued, plantations must adopt data-driven methods that leverage real-time analytics, precision agriculture, and Internet of Things (IoT) technology to optimize resources, cut waste, and increase resilience against climate change.

“By utilizing data to guide our decisions, we can revolutionize plantation management,” he added. “The combination of DDDM and precision agriculture allows us to optimize resources and foster sustainability in ways traditional methods cannot.”

Central to his presentation was the concept of precision agriculture, an innovative approach that uses data to tailor farming practices to the unique needs of each plantation. Technologies such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Variable Rate Technology (VRT), and remote sensors help growers monitor and manage critical factors like soil moisture, nutrient content, and crop health.

This data-driven approach, Embuldeniya noted, enables plantations to address specific challenges efficiently, leading to higher yields, lower costs and reduced environmental impact.

Embuldeniya highlighted that the adoption of DDDM has far-reaching sustainability benefits, allowing plantations to reduce chemical inputs, lower water usage and avoid excess fertilizer application. By using data from IoT devices and precision tools, plantations can better manage pest control and optimize their fertilization schedules, promoting both soil health and biodiversity.

This approach, he explained, also helps plantations adapt to climate change. With predictive analytics, growers can make informed decisions on planting schedules and crop rotations based on historical data and current environmental conditions, ensuring resilience in the face of changing weather patterns.

Embuldeniya illustrated the power of machine learning and big data analytics through a case study on corn yield prediction in the United States. By analyzing data from IoT sensors and satellite imagery, farmers in the Midwest achieved significant yield increases by adjusting practices to weather conditions and soil health data. This success, he argued, is a testament to the impact of DDDM and IoT integration in modern agriculture, providing valuable insights for Sri Lanka’s own plantation sector.
