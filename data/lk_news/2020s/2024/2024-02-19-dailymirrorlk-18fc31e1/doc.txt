No pension, government payment made to Shiranthi, says Mahinda Rajapaksaâ€™s office

Colombo, Feb 19 (Daily Mirror) - The office of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today denied allegations by a Buddhist monk that government payments and pensions have been allocated to former First Lady Shiranthi Rajapaksa.

Chief Incumbent of the Mihintale Raja Maha Viharaya, Ven. Walahahengunawewe Dhammaratana Thera, recently claimed that the former First Lady had been receiving multiple pensions and government payments.

In response to the allegations, the office of the former President clarified that the claims by Ven. Dhammaratana Thera are based on unverified information and hence, these claims are vehemently rejected.
