Minister warns of imposing price control on eggs

Colombo, March 13 (Daily Mirror) - In a bid to provide eggs at a reasonable price ahead of the upcoming festive season, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said a controlled price will be imposed in light of soaring prices.

This was raised during a discussion held between the Agriculture Minister and representatives of the All Ceylon Egg Producers' Association today (13).

During the discussion, the existing prices of eggs were taken into consideration, highlighting the need to further bring down the prices, which is currently at Rs. 48.

Egg producers also expressed their willingness to reduce the prices as they have already noticed a downward trend in the price.

However, the Minister asserted that a controlled price would be imposed if the egg producers failed to reduce prices.
