President restricts foreign travel for Govt. members as party gears up for presidential polls

Colombo, April 10 (Daily Mirror) - Ahead of the presidential election, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has instructed the government members to restrict foreign travel as much as possible because their presence is required to undertake political work, an informed source said.

The United National Party (UNP) led by the President is planning to ramp up political work in view of the election after the May Day rally.

The party is planning to conduct the rally on a grand scale this year as a springboard for the launch of political work directly targeting the presidential elections. At the moment, the party is in the process of conducting meetings across the country with professional groups.

The President is planning to participate in the election representing a broad alliance where numerous parties and groups are slated to join.

Already, a large number of SLPP MPs have thrown their weight behind him while the other faction of the party insists on fielding its own candidate.

Asked for a comment in this regard, UNP Chairman MP Vajira Abeywardena said no other candidate could match the international stature of the President.

Responding to a query whether the President would tie up with Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), he said, “The President is capable of working with any party. He accomplished what no other leader can do.”
