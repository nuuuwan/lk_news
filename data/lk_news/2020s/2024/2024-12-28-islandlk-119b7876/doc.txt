Hutch lights up festive spirits with Sri Lanka’s ‘Tallest Christmas Tower’

HUTCH is lighting up the Sri Lankan skyline with the tallest Christmas Tower the country has ever seen – “The Christmas Innovation Tower”. What was once seen as a day-to-day cell tower has been transformed into a striking symbol for hope, inspiring everyone as we enter the new year, to think differently to make remarkable progress.

The record tower soaring 282 feet (86 meters) into the sky is situated at the HUTCH Data Center in Walpola, Ragama in the district of Gampaha, and can be seen from many miles away.

The Christmas Innovation Tower lights up on Christmas Eve, 24th December 2024, standing tall as a beacon for inspiration to all Sri Lankans. Public are warmly invited to visit and safely view this spectacular display, celebrating the season of joy and creativity together.

The Christmas Innovation Tower is a testament demonstrating how we can transform everyday things we easily overlook into creating something great.

At Hutch, we’re more than just a network provider—we’re enablers of progress, empowering Sri Lankans to explore new options and possibilities with the resources available. The Christmas Innovation Tower, whilst it celebrates the season’s festive spirits, is a call to action for every Sri Lankan to embrace their innovative spirit as well and transform challenges into greater opportunities,” said Hamdhy Hassen, CMO, Hutch Sri Lanka.
