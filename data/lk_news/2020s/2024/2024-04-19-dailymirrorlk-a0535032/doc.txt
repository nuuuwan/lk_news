Election Commission to accept SLFP nominations despite disputes

Colombo, April 19 - Notwithstanding the internal friction within the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) resulting in changes in party's leadership positions, the Election Commission clarified its role in accepting nominations for SLFP candidates in the event that internal conflicts persist beyond the declaration of elections.

However, the Commission asserted that it has no legal authority to mediate in the internal conflicts within the SLFP.

This was taken into account when the Commission members met yesterday (18) to scrutinize documents submitted by certain members of the SLFP pertaining to recent shifts in party leadership positions.

On April 8, during a politburo meeting chaired by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, incumbent Vice Chairman MP Nimal Siripala de Silva was appointed Acting President, while MP Duminda Dissanayake was named General Secretary.

These appointments came in the wake of a Colombo District Court order restraining former President Maithripala Sirisena from functioning as SLFP chairman, following a complaint by Kumaratunga. The court order has been extended till May 9.

MP Dissanayake submitted documents regarding these appointments to the Election Commission, with objections filed by the SLFP's Acting General Secretary Sarathi Dushmantha Mithrapala challenging them.

However, upon review, the Election Commission concluded that it lacks the legal mandate to intervene in the party's internal disputes.

The Commission members emphasized that such matters should be resolved through the courts, as the commission is not authorized to intervene under existing legal frameworks.
