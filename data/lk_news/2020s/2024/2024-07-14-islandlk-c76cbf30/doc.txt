Weere, the Blind Scholar, at Peradeniya

I met Weere (Weerakkody) at Peradeniya University in 1972, when we were final-year students – he was in Western Classics, and I was in Sociology. We were at Arunachalam Hall as resident students. Weere was blind. He knew how many steps he had to walk from his room to the dining room, hall telephone, toilet, and office. Carefully counting his steps, he strolled towards his destination with his white cane. Any interruption to his calculation of steps would make him mad. He then demanded someone to take him back to his room, where he could restart his walk and count the steps. When he went to his classes, church, or Arts Theatre, he depended on a small circle of friends for assistance, and I was one of them.

On Sundays, Weere, accompanied by a few friends, would walk to the Catholic Church, where he was a frequent speaker. He often shared his thoughts with the congregation, and his speeches were always enlightening. Once, he addressed the congregation on ‘Witnesses of Truth and Belief.’ He invited someone to translate his speech into Sinhala, sentence by sentence, to benefit freshers who had just joined the university. I volunteered. I was amazed to watch his enthusiasm and breadth of knowledge on Christianity and other religions, especially Judaism.

After the church service, Weere was looking for me. He recognised my voice and asked whether I could walk with him to Arunachalam Hall. I agreed. He told me he would like to be my friend. He accompanied me to his room to show me his books. We had about one hour before lunch, and he asked me to read a few pages from a large book he had borrowed from the library. He said my reading abilities were excellent. He suggested I visit him more often, read his books, and discuss them with him.

I told him I could not fully understand some passages I had just read, and they were like Greek to me. He smiled and said, “Yes, what you have just read was a difficult translation of an ancient Greek script!” He studied Latin, Ancient Greek, Classical Civilization, and Ancient History. He said reading classics would make a man a cultured gentleman. He hastened to say, “You are already a gentleman. By reading classics with me, you could polish your English.”

Several female classmates generously helped him by reading him textbooks and literature aloud. Some had complicated personal experiences with Weere, as he was very fond of knowing the female body. Perhaps he wanted to understand the female body by exploring it, as he could not see it. Some female classmates felt uncomfortable when he attempted to touch them while reading books to him. They felt terrible telling him to stop because he was blind and helpless. They did their “duty” and dropped out from his reading clique as early as possible to escape from him.

Once, a classmate offered to introduce him to a blind undergraduate at Ramanathan Hall. But he refused to meet her. He told the classmate he would consider developing a relationship only with a ‘normal’ girl who could see. Unfortunately, he never met a ‘normal’ girl and remained single.

After lectures, Weere would wait at the main entrance to the Arts Faculty, hoping for someone to assist him back to the hall. He would listen to the students around him, trying to ‘identify’ a friend he could ask to walk with him. Some friends would silently tiptoe past him, avoiding his request for help. Despite these challenges, Weere’s determination and resilience were evident to all who knew him. His unwavering spirit inspired his friends and classmates.

One Thursday morning, I saw him waiting for someone in front of the main library. I offered to walk with him as I was returning to the hall. He politely declined the offer, saying, “I have some official work today. I will come later. Thanks for the offer”. After reaching the hall, I checked the pedestrians on the Galaha road and saw Weere walking with a female colleague. I told my friends what Weere did. Subsequently, it became our pastime to offer to bring him to the hall soon after Thursday morning classes. He refused our help and waited for his friend to take him to the hall.

Every day at 6 pm, Weere would climb the stairs to the hall telephone. One day, I decided to play a prank and removed the phone cord from the socket before he arrived. To my surprise, Weere managed to reach the telephone, found the dead phone, and after a brief moment of thought managed to reconnect the cord and make his call. Before leaving, he removed the cord from the socket and hid it under the deck with a smile, showcasing his independence and resourcefulness.

I tried to avoid Weere on weekdays as I was studying. I thought he could not locate me if I did not talk when he was around. But  Weere knew where I usually sat in the dining room. It was great fun for my colleagues to tell him, “Here is Jayantha to your left” or “in front of you.” He invariably asked me to read a few pages from a “fascinating” book he borrowed from the library. Often, I was reluctant to go; nevertheless, each time he wanted me to read, I agreed.

Once, he was studying the architecture of the Temple of Hephaestus in Athens, a well-preserved ancient temple. Weere was fascinated by the details of Greek architecture and wanted to remember as much information as possible from the reading. I had to re-read some sections for him, and he absorbed every word I read. If I hesitated to read a word because it was strange to me, he assisted me in pronouncing it correctly and discussed its meaning with me. He typed notes on the braille typewriter at the end of the reading, which usually lasted an hour. He showed me how to type and read braille script on brown paper.

Weere discouraged his friends from entering his room. He had kept his belongings according to a pattern that only he knew. Once, at an after-dinner hall meeting, he spoke on Greek Literature and wanted to show some building diagrams to the group. He shouted, “Jayantha, please bring the sketches I showed you last night. When you enter my room, to your left side is the small cupboard. Beyond the closet, there is a book self. There is a big file on the second shelf at the far-left corner. Please bring it. It is straightforward to find the file.” I was curious to know how he found my presence at the talk.

Weere was generous and allowed his friends to borrow things from him. Once, when a junior student borrowed his glue stick, Weere told him to leave it on the book cabinet. But the friend left it on Weere’s table. Weere was angry and hated people who messed around with his belongings.

Weere had a few juniors as his friends. Although kind and helpful, Weere sometimes demanded their services, which they resented.  Weere once asked one of them to wash a bundle of dirty clothes. When the junior refused, Weere was sad and told him not to tell anyone about the request.

Weere was an ardent member of the University drama and musical societies. He assisted the DRAMSOC (University Dramatic Society) in translating Latin and Greek stories into Sinhala and writing drama scripts. He spent hours training actors and singers. As a mature student, Weere felt comfortable working with professors and lecturers on such engagements. At the church, he sang English, Latin and Sinhala Christian hymns beautifully. He was the author of several hymns.

During the weekends, Weere gladly joined his friends for an evening walk on the campus or to see a documentary film at the Arts Theatre. He also loved to listen to Sinhala music that the Arts Theatre had organised. Each year, it hosted a French film festival. Once, I went with Weere to see a French film. He proudly translated French dialogues into Sinhala for me and two others. He enjoyed the film more than I did. After the movie, he explained to me the role of French cinema in changing French urban society.

After the film, I waited with Weere for a few minutes on the parapets in front of the Arts Theatre. I watched vehicles and pedestrians on the Galaha road. Weere suddenly inquired, “Is there a demonstration that goes towards the Vice Chancellor’s Lodge?” I did not see any demonstration, but I saw a group of students alighting from a bus shouting at each other. Weere interpreted their shouting as a demonstration and presumed the students were moving towards VC Lodge to protest against some issue.

I once felt that Weere had betrayed me by studying while I was demonstrating with my other friends against the poor quality of hall food. When I told him how disappointed I was not to see him among the demonstrators, he told me that he was a poor man and that the university had fully subsidised his education. Therefore, it would be improper for him to join anti-university or hall agitations. I told him I was also a poor student who got a bursary but wanted to participate in students’ protests and agitations. He laughed and said, “You are a Marxist; that is why you want to join them. But I am an Aristotelian and believe in debate and consultation. In any case, Marx is too recent for me.”

I was disappointed when I saw Weere studying in the dark when the entire student population at the university was demonstrating against power cuts, which lasted one to two hours every day. His defence of studying during the dark spell was that he did not know the power had gone out! I asked him, “Did not you hear the shouting and screaming of students?” He said, “My hearing is also getting bad.” I knew that was not true, but I did not contradict him as I knew he was against any type of protest or agitation.

Weere got a first-class in Western Classics. But he was unhappy. He told me that his favourite subject was the only paper for which he got a ‘B’ pass. On his demand, his professors checked with the School for the Blind at Ratmalana (where his answer scripts were translated into the Roman script from the Braille script) whether the school had made a mistake in translating his answer script. The School found two untranslated braille pages that were a part of Weere’s answer script. The professors apologised to Weere for poorly handling his answer scripts and revised his ‘B’ grade to an ‘A.’

Weere joined the university teaching staff and won a government scholarship to read for a PhD at Hull University in the UK. His thesis examined Greece and Roman contacts with ancient Sri Lanka. He returned to Sri Lanka and joined Peradeniya University as a lecturer in Western Classics. He translated several Greek and Latin classics into Sinhala. His famous translations were Plato’s Phaedo and the Republic. His translations opened the doors for students who studied in Sinhala to read Western classics and study Western philosophy. When he died at 68 in 2013, a colleague wrote a newspaper article about him. He said, “Weerakkody was born blind but worked much more than many other academics who had sight.”
