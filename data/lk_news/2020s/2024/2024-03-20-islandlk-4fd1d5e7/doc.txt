Fitch Bumps Up Asia Asset Finance PLC to A+ (Stable)

Fitch Ratings Lanka recently upgraded Asia Asset Finance PLC’s (AAF) credit rating to A+ (Stable) from A- (Stable). This reaffirms AAF’s position as one of Sri Lanka’s premier licensed finance companies. This upgraded rating underscores the company’s strength, stability and trust, and serves as a testament to its ability to manoeuvre in a dynamic business environment. It also places AAF in an elite group of Sri Lanka’s most trusted financial institutions.

With the support of our parent company, we are confident that we will continue to provide exceptional gold-based financial products and services, and we look forward to the further growth and stability as Sri Lanka’s economy recovery emerges.”
