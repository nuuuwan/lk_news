Don’t make Presidential election a regime changing poll: Vajira

Colombo, April 18 (Daily Mirror) - People should not make the 2024 Presidential election a regime changing poll as it has to be one which elects a custodian for the nation, UNP Chairman Vajira Abeywardana said today.

"The Presidential election should be one which elects a custodian who is capable of making Sri Lanka a stable country. Incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe is the only leader who has such a capability. People can use the  general election to bring about a regime change. They can send all 225 MPs home including me at the general election, the MP told a briefing.

Asked whether people will accept  Wickremesinghe as a good custodian, the MP said such an eventuality will be obvious.

"Most of you don't see what is happening behind the scenes. Therefore you  have to wait and see what will happen at the Presidential election," he said.

Meanwhile, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Beliatta organizer Druvin Pravin Athapatthu joined the UNP today and obtained his membership from the UNP Chairman.
