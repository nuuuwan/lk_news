President inaugurates second phase of Kompannavidiya flyover

President Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday inaugurated the second phase of the flyover spanning between Kompannavidiya and Justice Akbar Mawatha over the railway line.

The project, constructed by the Transport and Highways Ministry at a cost of Rs. 5,278 million, aims to alleviate traffic congestion and improve connectivity in the area.

The Road Development Authority (RDA), in collaboration with MÃ¤ga Engineering, undertook this project to address the delays and traffic congestion caused by the frequent closing of railway gates for the 109 daily train journeys.

The project is important in enhancing urban mobility and supporting economic growth.

In the bustling commercial area of Kompannavidiya, which hosts various institutions including Government offices, private sector companies , religious places, hotels, cinema halls, apartments nearly three hours of the day is wasted due to the closing of railway gates. With the completion of the flyover, travel from Kompannavidiya towards Galle Face and Colombo Fort will be smooth and free of traffic jams.

The development is expected to contribute significantly to the economy by reducing the time people spend on the road.

The inauguration ceremony was attended by Transport, Highways and Mass Media Minister Bandula Gunawardena, Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Presidential Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayaka and Transport and Highway Ministry Secretary Ranjith Rubasinghe.
