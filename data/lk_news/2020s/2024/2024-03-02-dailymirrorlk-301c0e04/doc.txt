Matara Rest House roof damaged as helicopter carrying PM touches down

Matara, March 2 (Daily Mirror) - Strong winds generated during the landing of a helicopter carrying Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena at the Matara Fort Grounds resulted in damage to the roof of the Matara Rest House, leading to the disposal of a significant amount of food and drinks intended for customers yesterday.

However, the helicopter landed on the ground without any harm to passengers including the Prime Minister onboard, who arrived to attend the funeral of late Minister Ronnie de Mel.

The manager of the Matara Rest House attributed the incident to the powerful sea breeze at the time.
