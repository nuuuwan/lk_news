President promises to improve English proficiency across Sri Lanka within 10 years

President Ranil Wickremesinghe assured that English language proficiency would be made accessible to every child through the implementation of the “English for All” program within the next decade.

“In the first two years, we will focus on training teachers and then extend training to others. We will also provide opportunities for private institutions to register and teach English. Within 10 years, we can significantly improve English proficiency across the country,” he said.

The President claimed that the JVP had protested against his proposal to introduce English education through the White Paper when he was the Minister of Education.

He argued that if this program had been implemented at that time, the country would not be facing the English language issues it does today.

President Wickremesinghe made these remarks yesterday (17th) following a meeting with the people of Malwana, in response to a question posed by a young person who inquired about what the government could do for youth struggling with English language skills.

While outlining his vision of a brighter future for Generation Z, the President urged the youth not to be misled by the political schemes of Sajith and Anura, who he says have no vision and only fake plans.

Replying to a query from a first-time voter and student, the President said they are striving for a brighter tomorrow. “The rupee is gaining strength, and the economy is beginning to stabilize.”

He emphasized that it’s up to the younger generation to carve out the future they desire. “My aim is to create a better tomorrow for all you amazing Gen Z individuals.”

Asked about the harassment faced by Muslim women wearing hijabs, niqabs, and abayas when entering offices and public places a few months ago, the President said: “As long as I am President, you will not face such issues.”

“If you wish to wear traditional attire, that is your choice. If not, that is also your decision. I understand the challenges you have faced. I was even criticized during a commission inquiry for stating that Muslim women should not be scrutinized or forced to remove their attire.”

“Despite protests, I acknowledged the hardships you endured, especially with the forced cremations of your loved ones. Now, I have introduced a law allowing individuals to choose between cremation and burial, respecting their personal wishes,” he added.
