Cinnamon Bey Beruwala pioneers installation of first-ever Ocean Strainer in Kalutara District

Cinnamon Bey Beruwala proudly announces the launch of a significant environmental initiative as part of the Clean Water Project by John Keells Holdings (JKH). Coinciding with the World Environment Day and World Ocean Day celebrations, the first ever ocean strainer was installed in the Beruwala canal, marking a pivotal step towards improving water quality and marine conservation in the Kaluthara district.

With the collaborative efforts of the John Keells Foundation, MAS Holdings, the Beruwala Urban Council, and the National Waste Management Centre, the project was successfully implemented within a week of its initiation. This installation represents the initial phase of a broader effort to reduce marine pollution and protect coastal ecosystems. The ocean strainer will play a crucial role in filtering waste from the canal, preventing it from reaching the ocean and causing harm to marine life.

“As a popular tourist destination, Beruwala attracts visitors from around the globe who come to experience its pristine beaches, rich marine life, and vibrant coral beds. The livelihoods of our local community are intricately linked to the health of our oceans, as fishing and tourism are key sources of income. At Cinnamon Bey Beruwala, we take responsibility, as a leading resort operating in the region, to ensure that these vital resources are protected for generations to come. The installation of the first-ever Ocean Strainer in the Kaluthara District highlights our commitment to safeguarding the environment and sustaining our community. Through initiatives like these, we strive to ensure that there is no adverse impact on the livelihoods of our people, the marine ecosystem, or the tourism industry in Beruwala.” said Lankesha Ponnamperuma, General Manager of Cinnamon Bey Beruwala.

Additionally, Cinnamon Bey Beruwala also engaged in a beach cleanup in collaboration with the Bentota Beruwala Hotel Association. Cinnamon Bey Beruwala successfully cleaned 1.7 kilometres of Beruwala beach, with several neighbouring hotels and beach caretakers joining the effort. This collective action not only made the beach cleaner but also highlighted the importance of community involvement in protecting the oceans.

The cleanup resulted in the removal of 283 kg of plastics, 166 kg of glass, 13 kg of metals, and 34 kg of other waste materials. This remarkable achievement is a significant step towards creating a more beautiful and cleaner environment.

“Projects such as the ocean strainer installation and beach cleanup efforts exemplify Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts’ unwavering dedication to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives.
