Paris Olympics: Sri Lanka’s Aruna Darshana to compete tonight

Sri Lankan sprinter Aruna Darshana, a key athlete for the island nation in this year’s Olympic Games is scheduled to participate in the preliminary round of the Men’s 400m event tonight (04).

Darshana will take part in the Heat 05 of the event, which is set to commence at 11.07 p.m. (local time) today.

Meanwhile, athletes from Italy, South Africa, Brazil, Grenada, Botswana, Canada and Switzerland are set to race in the Heat 5 alongside Aruna Darshana.

The 25-year-old remains at the 51st place in the Men’s 400m world rankings with a personal and seasonal best of 45.30 seconds.

Aruna Darshana recently showcased his exceptional speed and skill on the track achieving an impressive first-place finish in the 400m event at the 2nd Belt and Road Invitational Athletics Championship held in China.

He has been tipped by many to follow in the footsteps of former Sri Lankan athlete Sugath Thilakaratne. Darshana won the men’s 400m event during the 2018 National Athletics Championships by clocking a time of 46.16 seconds.
