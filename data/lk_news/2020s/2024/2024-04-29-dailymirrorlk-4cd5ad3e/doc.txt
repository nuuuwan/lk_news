Mullaitivu man claims to be tallest in Sri Lanka

Colombo, April 28 (Daily Mirror) - A man in Mullaitivu District claimed to be the tallest person in Sri Lanka.

According to BBC Sinhala Service, Gunasingham Kasenthiran, a former cadre of the proscribed Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) who lives in Kaiveli, Puthukudiruppu is seven feet two inches tall.

He laments that he has to face numerous problems due to his abnormal height. Nowhere in Sri Lanka could he find footwear that matches the length of his feet and he has been forced to get them from foreign countries, he states.

Kasenthiran who is the father of two children says that he cannot travel in a bus unless he gets a seat in it and he is forced to make a prior booking for a seat if he travels in a long distance bus.

A trishaw driver by profession, Kasenthiran has to drive his vehicle bending his neck.
