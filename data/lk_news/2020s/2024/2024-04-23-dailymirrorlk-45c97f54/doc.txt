Finance Minister urges vehicle document verification amid luxury vehicle ban

Colombo, April 23 (Daily Mirror) - State Finance Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya urged people to verify their vehicle documents with the Department of Motor Traffic (DMT) to ensure whether their vehicle is among the 112 luxury vehicles that have been temporarily prohibited from sale or transfer. Additionally, he stressed the importance of confirming whether the vehicles imported into the country have followed legal procedures.

He made these comments in response to the decision to temporarily halt the sale or transfer of 112 luxury vehicles imported into Sri Lanka, which has resulted in the government losing more than Rs. 7,000 million in tax revenue.

The Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court had issued an order after considering a request by the Intelligence Unit of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) which has initiated an investigation into these 112 luxury vehicles that were brought to Sri Lanka allegedly without proper clearance from the Sri Lanka Customs and entering false information into the computer data system of the DMT.

Explaining the situation, the State Minister emphasized that the current owners of the illegally imported vehicles should bear the responsibility for owning such vehicles. If found to be in violation, the vehicles will be confiscated.

"We cannot ascertain whether the current owners of the mentioned vehicles were involved in smuggling, but it is possible that these vehicles may have been sold to other individuals over the past few years.

"Therefore, the confiscation of these vehicles will be carried out through their current owners. Hence, the Minister urged people to exercise caution when purchasing vehicles.
