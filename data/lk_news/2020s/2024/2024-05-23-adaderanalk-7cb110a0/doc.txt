Prevailing showery and windy conditions to continue further

The Department of Meteorology says Southwest monsoon conditions are gradually establishing over the island, and hence, the prevailing showery and windy conditions will continue further.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central, North-western, Southern and Northern provinces.

Very heavy showers about 150 mm are likely at some places in Sabaragamuwa province and in Kandy and Nuwara-Eliya districts. Heavy showers above 100 mm are likely at some places in Western and North-western provinces and in Mannar, Galle and Matara districts.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places elsewhere of the island.

Strong winds of about 50-60 kmph can be expected at times over Western slopes of the central hills and in Northern, North-central, Western, Southern and North western provinces. Fairly strong winds of about 30-40 kmph can be expected at times elsewhere of the island.
