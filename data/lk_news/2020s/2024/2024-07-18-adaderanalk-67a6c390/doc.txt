Election Comm. urged to enforce new Election Expenses Act for presidential poll

Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has notified the Election Commission to enforce the Election Expenses Regulation Act No. 03 of 2023 for the forthcoming presidential election.

Highlighting issues with the current Proportional Representation electoral system, the minister stressed that it has become ineffective in addressing illegal activities, bribery, and extortion during parliamentary elections.

Rajapakshe emphasized that the Election Expenses Regulation Act No. 03 of 2023, introduced with the Election Commission’s full support, aims to transform the election culture and establish the rule of law.

Thus, he has urged the Election Commission to apply this legislation in the upcoming elections.

Against this backdrop, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Parliamentarian Vijitha Herath asserted that despite the government’s efforts to delay the presidential election, such attempts have been unsuccessful.

However, the General Secretary of United National Party (UNP) Palitha Range Bandara stated that the National People’s Power (NPP) is unlikely to secure victory in the upcoming presidential election.

Additionally, MP Shasheendra Rajapaksa of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) noted that their presidential candidate will be the person who will provide the best solution to the economic issues in the country.
