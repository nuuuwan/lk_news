Russian tourist fined Rs. 1.78Mn for damaging train in railway crossing mishap

A Russian tourist who haphazardly entered his motorcar into the railway level crossing regardless of the approaching train was ordered yesterday by Galle Additional Magistrate Lakmini Vidanagamage to pay Rs. 1.78 million to the Railways Department to compensate for damages to the train and a fine of Rs. 56,000 for the traffic offence.

The suspect, Loskotu Alexander, attempted to drive his motorcar with another passenger on board through the level crossing on January 23, 2023 and hit the Maho-bound express from Beliatta.

He and the other passenger who received injuries had been admitted to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital.

The railway engine and the colour signal system had been extensively damaged in the incident. Police had filed action against the tourist under the motor traffic regulations, while the department claimed compensation for damages to the railway property.

When the case was taken up for hearing yesterday, the lawyer appearing for the suspect told the court that the tourist was preparing to leave the country on February 29 and that he would plead guilty to the offence. OIC Ahangama Police CI Nalaka Jayaweera and SI Chandana made submissions for the state, while Attorneys at Law Pamudi Weerasooriya and Sisira Weerasuriya appeared for the suspect.
