Govt. reinstates previous visa issuing system

The new Government of Sri Lanka has officially reinstated the previous visa issuing system, effective from 12.00 midnight today, according to the Presidential Media Division (PMD).

Accordingly, starting from midnight today (26), all foreigners will be able to apply for visas under the previous system, the PMD said.

Meanwhile, the new Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka, Vijitha Herath, has issued a special statement regarding the matter.

He noted that “many people faced difficulties when the visa facility was managed by VFS Global. Foreigners traveling to Sri Lanka encountered various issues, leading to this swift action. Within 24 hours, the government implemented the court order to revert to the old system.”

“In consultation with the Attorney General, the government took immediate steps to comply with the court’s decision. Additionally, an analysis is underway to investigate the alleged irregularities in contracting the VFS organisation to issue visas,” he added.

This decision addresses the challenges that were previously affecting the visa process, according to the PMD.

Accordingly, as of midnight today, all foreigners will now be able to apply for visas under the reinstated system, it said.
