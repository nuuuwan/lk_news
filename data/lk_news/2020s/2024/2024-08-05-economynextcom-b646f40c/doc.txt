Sri Lanka’s Browns wraps up Kenya, Rwanda Lipton purchases

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Browns Investments said it had completed the acquisition of Lipton tea companies in Kenya and Rwanda from their UK and Netherlands based parents.

“This acquisition was executed through our wholly owned subsidiary, B Commodities ME FZE, incorporated in the United Arab Emirates,” the company said in a stock exchange filing.

The acquisition of Lipton Teas and Infusions Tanzania Limited, another target company, is still pending due to the outstanding approval from the Fair Competition Commission of Tanzania, the company said.

It had entered into a sales and purchase agreement (SPA) with Ekaterra Holdco UK Limited, and Netherlands based Ekaterra Group Holdings BV and Ekaterra Group Holdings 2 BV, to buy control of the Africa firms, Browns said in May.
