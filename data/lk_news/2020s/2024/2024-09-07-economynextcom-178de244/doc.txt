Sri Lanka foreign reserves rise $302m to US$5,954mn in August

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s gross official reserves rose 148.5 million dollars in August 2024 to 5,954 million dollars in August 2024, central bank data showed.

In 2024 the central bank bought at least 148.5 million US dollars from markets in August.

Gross official reserves are made up of the central bank’s monetary reserves bought against reserve money and also government foreign exchange balances borrowed from multilateral and other lenders.

Sri Lanka signed a 100 million dollar budget support loan from the Asian Development Bank in early August.

The central bank has previously also borrowed dollars from the domestic market participants against printed money to show a higher level of reserves than it had bought through final transactions, also creating money in the process.

Out of the reserves gross reserves 3.2 billion were tied to domestic and cross border swap.

The money can boomerang against actual bought reserves unless sterilized and also lead to reserve losses if they are unwound when confidence in the currency has (credibility of the peg) has been lost due to inflationary open market operations.

Analysts have warned that inflationary open market operations to sterilize interventions will eventually lead to a second default if the central bank continues to narrowly target a call money rate as private credit picks up.

When Sri Lanka’s central bank was set up in 1950 allowing macro-economists to print money cross border swaps were not invented as yet another trick to delay rate corrections and built up external imbalances.

Cross border swaps were also invented by the Federal Reserve in the 1960s as aggressive efforts were made to boost growth by rate cuts (full employment polices) to avoid showing gold reserve losses.

Swaps lead to large central bank losses when the currency eventually collapse from delayed rate corrections.

Sri Lanka and other monetary unstable countries lose reserves and run balance of payments deficits (and also default if there is exposure to illiquid bullet repayment sovereign bonds), by targeting the call money rate with printed money to generate inflation levels higher than around 2 percent or for growth.
