Health workers to stage protests near hospitals today

Health sector employees have decided to stage a series of protests in front of selected hospitals today (March 12).

The Convenor of Health Service Trade Unions, Ravi Kumudesh said the demonstrations were organized in protest of the continuous delaying of their salary increase and the failure to take action against the health sector administrators obstructing their work.

The protests are planned to be staged in front of selected state hospitals starting at noon, according to Kumudesh.
