Sri Lanka cabinet approval sought for debt restructuring process

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s President Ranil Wickremesinghe has sought cabinet approval for a matter relating to debt restructuring, Minister Bandula Gunwardana said.

“There were cabinet papers submitted to get approval for changes required for debt restructuring,” Minister Gunawardana told reporters this week.

“Restructuring external debt is the most decisive requirement of the country. Without restructuring debt it is not possible to take the country even one tenth of an inch (dasher-mer-yuk-wuth)”

Sri Lanka has reached in principle agreements with official creditors but has to sign final agreements (MOUs).

A deal with bond holders and other debt classified as commercial also has to be reached.

The International Monetary Fund has scheduled a meeting on June 12, to consider the review of Sri Lanka’s program. (Colombo/June06/2024)
