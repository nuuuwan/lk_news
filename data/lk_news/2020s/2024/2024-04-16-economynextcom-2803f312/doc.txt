Sri Lanka manufacturing expand amid falling prices, services surge: PMI

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s manufacturing and services sectors expanded in March ahead of a traditional New Year, with resurgence in tourism also helping, according to a Purchasing Managers’ Index compiled by the central bank.

The manufacturing PMI was 62.5 in March, compared to 56 points in February when the sector also expanded.

“This marks the highest PMI-Manufacturing that was recorded in three years,” the statement said. “All the sub-indices expanded on a month-on-month basis contributing to this increase, mainly driven by the seasonal demand.”

“Most of the manufacturers, especially in the food and beverage sector, were optimistic about the upcoming festive season,” the statement said.

“Moreover, Employment and Stock of Purchases increased during the month in line with the New Orders and Production. Further, a decline in price levels was also evident.”

The Services PMI was 67 percent, a notable 14 points up from 53 points in February.

The ongoing expansion of Business Activities was driven by the improvements observed across a majority of the sub-sectors, such as wholesale and retail trade, financial services, insurance, transportation and professional services sub-sectors, ahead of the festive season, the statement said.

New businesses increased in March, with employment also having increased due to new recruitments made by several companies in view of the festive season, it said.

Backlogs of work continued to decline, yet at a slower rate during March.

It had also said that the accommodation, food and beverage sub-sector continued to see growth owing to the growing tourist arrivals, while transportation, professional services sub-sectors and other personal activities also showed positive growth. (Colombo/Apr16/2024)
