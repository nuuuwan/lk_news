Ceylinco Insurance leads annual beach clean-up across 100 km coastline

Ceylinco General Insurance conducted its annual Beach Clean-up program along over 100 km of Sri Lanka’s coastline, with participation from staff across its branches and head office. Held for the third consecutive year, the initiative aims to combat increasing pollution along tourist and densely populated beaches. Over 1,250 employees volunteered, collecting and segregating plastics and other waste, which was then responsibly disposed of through local municipal councils. The project’s goal is to restore the coastline’s natural beauty, protect marine life, and encourage other organizations and citizens to maintain clean beaches.
