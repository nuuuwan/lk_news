Ramayana trail will be game changer for Sri Lanka tourism: Indian envoy

ECONOMYNEXT – The establishment of Ramayana trial which includes a land bridge between Sri Lanka and India will be a “game changer” for the island nation’s tourism industry, Indian High Commissioner for Colombo Santosh Jha said.

Sri Lanka has seen a spike in tourist arrivals from India in its recovery from an unprecedented economic crisis.

The island nation has renewed efforts to establish of Ramayana Trails, which includes all the places believed to be associated with Ramayana.

The places include Sigiriya, Ashok Vatika, a garden in the city of Nuwara Eliya, which is believed to be the place where Ravana kept Sita captive, Ravana Ella Falls, Koneswaram Temple in Trincomalee and Divurumpola Temple in Bandarawela which is believed to be the place where Sita underwent a trial by fire to prove her purity among many other places.

“Our effort to establish the land bridge, on which we have begun our joint work, promises to further provide fillip to our ongoing efforts to promote tourism between our two countries. No doubt that it will be a game changer,” Jha told at the official launch of the “Ramayana Trail – The Sacred Mission” project organised by the Supreme Global Holdings group.

“It will, of course, bring many benefits to communities along the alignment of this connectivity but more specifically, it will make Ramayana and Buddhism tourism easier and more alluring to people on both sides.”

Historians say, according to Hindu mythology, Sri Lanka was the kingdom of Ravana, the ten-headed demon king who abducted Sita, the wife of Rama, the hero of the Ramayana, a smriti text from ancient India, one of the two important epics of Hinduism known as the Itihasas, the other being the Mahabharata.

The epic narrates the life of Rama, a prince of Ayodhya in the kingdom of Kosala.

Indian investors have come forward to establish Ramayana Trails in Sri Lanka, government officials say, focusing more on Indian tourists to boost the hospitality industry.

Indians topped the list of tourists to Sri Lanka last year with over 300,000 visitors.

The launch was also coincided with the visit of Govind Dev Giriji Maharaj, Swamiji from Ayodhya. Jha said the activities

organised during his visit to Sri Lanka will further help in raising awareness about the Ramayana trail among the Indians.

“It is bound to increase the flow of Indian tourists and pilgrims to these destinations,” Jha said.

“Unlike others, Indian tourists also visit both Buddhist and Hindu places of worship. They are also attracted to historical sites existing across Sri Lanka. In that sense, they are more diversified in their choice of sites and places they visit in Sri Lanka.”

“The economic value of attracting Indian tourists into Sri Lanka, therefore, is greater as the benefits of their travels goes to a larger cross section of people dependent on tourism business and to those who are located in all the provinces in Sri Lanka.”

“This is unlike other tourists, who are mostly interested in adventure and beach tourism and therefore their business benefits have more limited spread and distribution.” (Colombo/April 22/2024)
