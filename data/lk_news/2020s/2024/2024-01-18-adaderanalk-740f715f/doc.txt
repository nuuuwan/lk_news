One killed in police gunfire in Narammala

A man was killed in police gunfire reported in the Dampelessa area of Narammala, Police Media Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa said.

A group of police officers had chased down a lorry after its driver failed to comply with the signal to stop at a police checkpoint in the Dampelessa area this evening (Jan. 18).

Later, the police officers managed to pull over the lorry and inspect the vehicle. However, during the inspection, one of the officers had ‘accidentally fired’ his gun, killing the driver, the police said.

The Sub-Inspector (SI) who fired the shot has thus been arrested.
