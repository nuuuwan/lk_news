Is the  ITAK  President Elect  Shritharan Changing Party  Policy From Espousing Federalism to that of Supporting  TamiL Eelam?

The premier political party representing  Sri Lankan Tamils in Parliament has got a new leader. The Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi(ITAK) known in English as the Federal Party(FP) has elected Jaffna district Parliamentarian Sivagnanam Shritharan as its president in Trincomalee on 21 January 2024. The president elect will be formally installed  in office at the party convention to be held on 28 January in Trinco. Shritharan  will serve  a  two-year term   as ITAK/FP president.

Initially there were three contenders in the fray for the ITAK Presidency. The three aspirants to the ITAK leadership mantle were Mathiaparanan Abraham Sumanthiran, Sivagnanam Shritharan and Seenithamby Yoheswaran.  Sumanthiran born in 1964  and Shritharan born in 1968  are both Jaffna district MP’s while Yogeswaran  born in 1970 is a former Batticaloa district Parliamentarian.

What was perceived as a triangular contest turned into a duel between Sumanthiran and Shritharan after the “third man” Yoheswaran declared solidarity with Shritharan and called upon his supporters to vote for Shritharan. Both Shritharan and Yoheswaran  conducted an overt and covert campaign together against Sumanthiran  who  was  unfairly and viciously attacked  as an enemy of “Thamil Thesiyam”(Tamil nationalism) whose victory would ring the death -knell for Tamil nationalism.

Shritharan on the other hand was promoted as the protector of “Thamil Thesiyam” who would follow in the footsteps of the “Thesiyath Thalaiver”  or (national leader). Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) supremo Veluppillai Prabhakaran who died in May 2009  is referred to by his supporters and sycophants as the Tamil National leader  or “Thesiyath Thalaiver”

Sumanthiran’s direct campaign was restrained and dignified. He did not respond to the accusations and allegations levelled  covertly and overtly against him by the Shritharan-Yoheswaran duo. He only outlined his plans for the betterment of the party and the Tamil people if he was elected President of ITAK. Sumanthiran did not  try to refute the untrue accusation that he was against Tamil Nationalism. He ignored it with supreme disdain. To his credit, Sumanthiran also made no reference to the LTTE in his campaign.

However Sumanthiran’s decorum  was not followed by his supporters on social media. They  fired away at Shritharan in their posts and tweets. This was the  situation in Shritharan’s case too. His supporters kept shelling Sumanthiran with their tweets and posts. Supporters of Tamil parties opposed to the ITAK exploited the situation to vilify both Sumanthiran and Shritharan as well as the ITAK in their posts and tweets.

In fairness to both Shritharan and Sumanthiran, I do not think that either of them coud stop, check or control their supporters on social media even if they want to or try  to do so. The social media phenomenon is uncontrollable  like Dr.Frankenstein’s monster in some aspects.

A recurring theme in the pro- Sumanthiran social media was the extolling of his positive attributes especially his legal prowess and deftness in handling diplomatic engagements. Shritharan was criticized for his deficiency in legal matters and linguistic (English)skills.

Shritharan’s supporters countered this by saying knowledge of the law and English was not necessary to lead the Tamil people. They pointed out that LTTE supremo Prabhakaran did not have these attributes. They also said that Shritharan could make up for these by enlisting the services of legal experts and experienced interpreters and translators. They even cited KV Thavarasa PC and Ex-Judge CV Wigneswaran  as those who could serve Shritharan in this regard.

The ITAK party constitution stipulates that  members of the “Podhuchabai”(general Council) and members of the “Mathiya Seyal Kuzhu”(Central Working Committee) will form the electoral college to elect a president if an election was held. The election would be by secret ballot. However the ITAK from its inception in 1949 has not held a president election. It has followed the tradition of averting a  direct election by arriving at a  choice through consensus.

This tradition was not followed by the party this time. The main  candidates Sumanthiran and Shritharan were unable or unwilling to reach a compromise  on the matter. Thus  the ITAK for the first time in its 74 year old history has held  an election  for the post of Party President.

Conducting an inner party election is the responsibility of the party general secretary and administrative  secretary. The party deputy general secretary Dr.P.Sathialingam has been functioning as the acting general secretary after the gen secy K. Thurairajasingham resigned in 2020. A new Gen Secy can only be elected at the ITAK convention next week-end. However Dr. Sathialingam afflicted by pneumonia was hospitalised.

The administrative  secretary Xavier Kulanayagam had earlier nominated MA Sumanthiran as a candidate. Thus he  was ineligible to conduct the poll as he was not perceived as being “neutral”. The same applied to ITAK senior vice president and former Northern Provincial Council chairman CVK Sivagnanam. He too was among the 12 persons who nominated Sumanthiran as candidate.

In this situation an ad-hoc arrangement was made with the consent of candidates Shritharan and Sumanthiran. A committee was formed to handle and coordinate the election arrangements. The 8 member committee represented all eight districts of the North and East.

The committee members and districts they represented were as follows –  Kugathasan -Trincomalee, Saravanabavaan -Batticaloa, Kodeeswaran -Amparai,Kanagasabapathy- Jaffna,Kurukularajah-Kilinochchi, Paranjothy -Mannar, Karunanidhi- Vavuniya and Shanthini Sriskandarajah -Mullaitheevu. Ms. Sriskandarajah and Kodeeswaran are ex -MPs. Kurukularajah is a former Northern provincial minister while Saravanabavaan is the former Mayor of Batticaloa. Since the election and party convention are being held in Trincomalee the ITAK Trinco district chairman Kigathasan played an important role in the logistics of the poll.

The General council  comprises members  elected at grass roots level by the party branches in each district, The branches represented  by and large  the respective AGA divisions in each district. Each branch with the exception of Colombo  has  5 members in the General Council. Since the Colombo branch is for the entire district, it was entitled to 8  members in the General Council.

On this basis 288  members of the General Council elected by57 branches  were entitled to vote at the ITAK presidential elections. The respective districts and the number of representatives are as follows – Jaffna -75, Batticaloa – 50, Amparai-35, Trincomalee -30, Mannar -25, Mullaitheevu -25, Kilinochchi-20, Vavuniya -20 and Colombo -08.

The Central Working Committee  comprises 43 members at present. Apart from these the outgoing president Somasundaram Sriskandarajah alias “Maavai” used his presidential discretion to nominate 18 others. These included Sashikala  Raviraj who contested the 2020 elections from Jaffna and is the widow of former MP  Nadarajah Raviraj who was killed in Colombo in 2008. Incidentally Senathirajah’s son Kalai Amuthan is married to Sashikala’s daughter Pravina.

Thus a total number of 349  consisting of 288 General council members along with  43   from the Central working Committee  plus 18 nominated by Senathirajah were eligible to vote. However several were not present to vote.  These included Veteran Tamil leader R.Sampanthan dubbed as “Perunthalaiver” (Great Leader)by the Tamil media  who was absent due to ill -health. Acting secy Sathialingam was in hospital. Former Jaffna MP Saravanabavan was absent as his mother had passed away/

Due to these reasons only 322 were present in Trincomalee to vote.   Among these were three Muslims from K’nochi, M’theevu and Trinco. ITAK President Senathirajah stated he was neutral on the question of his successor and abstained from voting. Although Yoheswaran had pulled out of the contest, his name was yet on the ballot paper. The names of the candidates were in alphabetical order. Thus Shritharan was first, Sumanthiran second and Yogeswaran third in the ballot paper order.

As stated earlier the three  cornered contest had become a straight fight  between Shritharan and Sumanthiran.Most political observers anticipated a close tussle in the election. The expectation was that Sumanthiran would win with a slender majority. The unexpected occurred. Shritharan won polling 184 votes. Sumanthiran polled 137. As expected Yoheswaran had zero votes. Shritharan polling 57% of the vote to Sumanthiran’s 43%  had a majority of 47 votes.

Though the voting was by secret ballot, it has been possible through “unorthodox” measures  to gauge the  voting trends and arrive at a preliminaty assessment of the voting pattern. It appears that Sumanthiran got  slightly more votes  than Shritharan in Jaffna and Mullaitheevu districts. The situation  in Mannar, Vavuniya and Colombo saw  Shritharan edging out Sumanthiran . Shritharan got the bulk of the votes in Kilinochchi, Amparai and Trincomalee . in Batticaloa Sumanthiran had a slight lead over Shritharan. Interestingly the bulk  of the 18 nominated by Senathirajah supported Shritharan.

These preliminary  estimates are subject to correction if and when more concrete details are available.  It appears  that Sumanthiran got less votes than  Shritharan in both  the North and East.. At the outset of the election it was surmised that Sumanthiran would sweep the eastern province with support from Batticaloa MP Shanakiyan Rasamanickam, Trincomalee district ITAK chairman Kugathasan,  ITAK National ilst MP Kalaiarasan from Amparai and ex- Amparai MP Kodeeswaran. Yet the eastern vote  had swung in favour of Shritharan.

Another feature of the voting was that in terms of age,  more “seniors”  seem to have  supported  Sumanthiran while  more “juniors”  have seemingly backed Shritharan. Sumanthiran got more support  than Shritharan in the Central Working Committee. How this situation came about and the reasons for the  shift in Eastern voting will be discussed at length in future articles.

After his victory, Shritharan went to the historic Koneshwaram temple in Trincomalee and did a special pooja. He then went to the Pathrakali Amman temple in Trincomalee. Incidentally the Pathrakali is the family deity of “perunthalaiver” Sampanthan. The temple priest draped a “ponnaadai”(golden shawl) around Shritharan’s shoulders and welcomed him. The priest also said that Sampanthan had already informed him of Shritharan’s coming. Incidentally Shritharan met Sampanthan and paid his respects after he returned to  Colombo the following day.

Shritharan returned to Kilinochchi his home turf immediately after the election on Sunday. He made a beeline to the LTTE  cemetery known as the “Maaveerar Thuyilum Illam”(resting abode for great heroes) at Kanakapuram in Kilinochchi. He was accompanied by supporters including a cassock-clad priest.

Shritharan paid his respects to the fallen tigers and laid “Karthigaipoo” flowers known as flame lily flowers. The botanical names are  Liliaceae Glory lily or Gloriosa superba. The LTTE declared this flower as the national flower of Tamil Eelam during its heyday. The red and yellow colours of the flower are the same as LTTE colours too.Shritharan took an oath to the memory of the fallen tigers and pledged that he would strive to achieve their dreams.

It was after he paid homage at the LTTE Cemetery that Shritharan went to worship at the Kilinochchi Sithi Vinaayagar temple dedicated to Lord Ganesh. Thereafter  the new ITAK leader attended a celebration organized by his supporters in Kilinochchi.

It is noteworthy that Shritharan did not visit the SJV Chelvanayagam memorial  in Jaffna  as a mark of respect to the ITAK’s co -founder and pioneering leader. SJV called “Thanthai Chelva” is   described by many as the father of federalism in Sri Lanka.  It has been customary for anyone being elected afresh to important posts in the ITAK to pay their respects to Father Chelva. Shritharan did not even visit the Chelvanayagam statue in Trinco. However he made it a point to visit the LTTE Cemetery in Kilinochchi and take a pledge. This has  raised fears that the new ITAK leaders is going to  abandon federalism and revive separatism.

By paying homage to the fallen LTTE fighters and by worshipping at Hindu temples, Shritharan displayed his gratitude to the twin  forces that helped him win the ITAK presidency. The first was the pro-LTTE  elements in the global Tamil Diaspora. The second  was the  Hindutva elements in India.

Both these sections worked ceaselessly via email, Whats App, Telephone and messenger to promote Shritharan’s candidacy among members of the General Council and Central working Committee. The carrot and stick method of Incentives and Threats was utilised.

This is why Shritharan made special mention of those overseas who had helped him to win and thanked them specifically in his victory speech  in Trincomalee.

Subsequently Shritharan issued a public statement in Tamil and sent it to the Tamil media on Monday January 22nd. In that he declared that he was for greater Tamil unity. Shritharan requested all those who had left the ITAK and/or the Tamil National Alliance(TNA) to return to the ITAK/TNA folds. He also invited all Tamil nationalist parties to accept his invitation and join him.

The new ITAK leader said in his statement that his desire and intention was to restore the TNA  to its former glory by returning to the pre -2009 situation when the TNA backed by the LTTE was a powerful entity. (It may be recalled that the ITAK was the chief constituent of the TNA and that in the 2004 elections , the TNA  had  22 seats in  Parliament). Shritharan ended by saying let us win back our rights and fulfill the dreams of our great heroes.(Maaveerar Kanavuhal).

The sting of the scorpion lies in its tail. Likewise  it is the end of Shritharan’s statement that is problematic and puzzling. It is an established fact that the fallen fighters of the LTTE including its supremo Prabhakaran were uncompromisingly intransigient in espousing their cause of Tamil Eelam. The motto of the LTTE was “Puligalin Thaaham Thamil Eelath Thaayagam”( The thirst of the tigers is for the Tamil Eelam motherland). Regardless of whether they were right or wrong in their quest, the tigers remained steadfast in their beliefs and ultimately paid the supreme price for their cause and conviction.

Now what is the fundamental policy of the ITAK known as the Federal Party in English?  The ITAK wants a power sharing arrangement on federal or quasi-federal lines. The ITAK aspires to a political structure within a united, indivisible Sri Lanka.

A key element in Tamil extremist  attacks on Sumanthiran is that the Jaffna district MP has been advocating  a power sharing scheme on federal lines. This was depicted as treachery to Tamil Nationalism. Viewed against this backdrop , how does Shritharan hope to reconcile the  separatist dreams of fallen LTTE fighters with the avowed Federal objective of his party?

Another related question is whether the ITAK has now changed its policy of federalism to separatism? Has the ITAK general council, Central working Committee or Politbureau approved or endorsed Shritharan’s policy change or is it a unilateral declaration by the ITAK president elect who is yet to be officially installed in office?

Moreover has the ITAK as a party endorsed or supported his invitation to other Tamil Parties? Are those parties being invited to subscribe to the ITAK’s stated policy or the radical policy announced by Shritharan?

Jaffna district MP  Shritharan has been elected to Parliament thrice in 2010, 2015 and 2020. In all three elections he has signed his nomination papers in accordance with the sixth Constitutional amendment disavowing separatism, He has been enjoying all the perks and privileges of an MP for nearly 14 years. Is it not sheer hypocrisy then  for him to project himself as a Tamil nationalist supporter of the LTTE dream of Tamil Eelam?

Shritharan  contested  the 2010 elections as a nominee of the EPRLF in the TNA. It was after he won that he switched sides and joined the ITAK. When he was fielded as a candidate,  some questions were raised about  his connections to the LTTE. Shritharan’s brothers in law are the late “Brigadier”Theepan and “Lt Col” Kilman of the LTTE. Shritharan said that though the LTTE stalwarts were his brothers in law by marriage, he  himself had no links to the LTTE.

Yet during his recent  campaigning in the  East, Shritharan  made startling disclosures. He claimed that he had joined the LTTE as a 13 year old when studying in grade 8; he claimed that he had received arms training, he claimed that he had helped bury the bodies of fighters belonging to the Jeyanthan infantry division at the Tharavai LTTE Cemetery; he said that he was part of a special LTTE  team that helped the victims of Tsunamil.

When I heard of Shritharan’s claims and heard recordings of his utterances,  I wrote to him seeking clarification on these issues. I have not received any responses. At least not yet. Now after his statement calling for a return to the pre-2009 situation and the invitation to realise the dreams of fallen LTTE fighters, I have sent him another set of questions seeking clarification. I hope to follow up with more articles after the ITAK President Sivagnanam Shritharan replies.
