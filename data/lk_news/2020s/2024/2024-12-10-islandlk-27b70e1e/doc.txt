Ideal Motors confident Mahindra’s ‘premium’ SUVs will be well received

Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., a global leader in the automotive industry, recently unveiled its SUV range and the all-new “Twin Peaks” visual identity at the Colombo Motor Show.

Representing a dynamic and adventurous spirit, the new logo reflects Mahindra’s focus on crafting premium SUVs that resonate with customers seeking both luxury and authenticity.

Nalin Welgama, Chairman, Ideal Motors, said, “We are delighted that Mahindra unveiled its new visual identity and flagship SUVs at the Colombo Motor Show. These SUVs showcase contemporary design, cutting edge technology and luxury features. I am sure these vehicles will be well received by Sri Lankan customers”.

“The market launch and commencement of sales are contingent upon the government’s timeline for lifting import restrictions. The pricing details will be announced closer to the market launch, considering the duties, taxes, and exchange rates applicable at the time”, company sources said.

Meanwhile, Mahindra reaffirmed its commitment to its Small Commercial Vehicle portfolio, emphasising that the City Pikup will continue to be on sale under its existing brand identity with the “Road Ahead” logo.
