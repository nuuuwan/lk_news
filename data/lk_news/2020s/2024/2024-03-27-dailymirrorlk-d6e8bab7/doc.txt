Technical malfunction leaves lives of hundreds of children with cancer at risk

Colombo, March 27 (Daily Mirror) - The prolonged breakdown of one of the linear accelerators at the Apeksha Hospital, Maharagama, which predominantly treats the pediatric patients has placed hundreds of lives at risk.

Sources familiar with the matter revealed that the linear accelerator, crucial for administering radiotherapy â€” a vital cancer treatment, has been non-operational since February.

Despite the severity of the situation, the Health Ministry has turned a blind eye by not taking remedial measures to rectify the issue, exacerbating the concerns.

Apeksha Hospital currently houses five linear accelerators, each playing a pivotal role in delivering various treatments. However, the malfunctioning machine holds particular significance for pediatric patients due to its specialized features.

Furthermore, the breakdown has resulted in a backlog of over 500 patients awaiting treatment, plunging many, especially children, into precarious circumstances where their lives hang in the balance.

Sources also noted that private hospitals charge exorbitant fees ranging from Rs 700,000 to Rs 1.7 Million for radiotherapy treatments, placing an immense financial burden on affected families.

When inquired about this from the Health Ministry, Director General of Health Services Dr Asela Gunawardena acknowledged the severity of the situation, admitting that patient lives are indeed at risk.

He reassured that efforts are underway to either repair or replace the malfunctioning machine.
