DSI Tyres introduces ‘Online Pick Up from Dealer’ system

DSI Tyres has introduced the Online Pick Up from Dealer system to customers through its website, dsityreshop.com, with numerous innovations. This system, launched for the first time in Sri Lanka, allows customers to quickly order tyres from the comfort of their homes and have them conveniently fitted at the nearest tyre dealer.

DSI Tyres Managing Director Kavinda Rajapaksa addressing the official ceremony to launch the Online Pick Up from Dealer system held at the Heritance Kandalama Hotel, said that the customers can make payments through the website and choose to have the tyres delivered to their homes via courier service or opt for the Online Pick Up from Dealer method to collect and fit the tyres at the nearest tyre shop. “Our goal is to make the tyre purchasing process as convenient and efficient as possible for our customers. With the launch of our new website, customers can easily access all the information they need about our tyres, compare different options, and make informed decisions without leaving their homes. Additionally, the easy payment methods available on our site ensure that even those without immediate funds can purchase the tyres they need,” he said.
