Bereaved family of Sanath Nishantha’s security officer receives Rs. 1.5mn

Sri Lanka Police has provided a cash donation of Rs. 1.5 million to the bereaved family of the Police Constable, who died while on duty in the tragic crash along with State Minister Sanath Nishantha.

The money was handed over to the family members by the Acting Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon.

Additionally, Police Constable Anuradha Jayakody, who was attached to the Ministerial Security Division (MSD), has been posthumously promoted to the rank of Sergeant.

Following the fatal collision that took place around 2:00 a.m. on January 25 on the Colombo - Katunayake expressway, three injured people including State Minister Nishantha had been rushed to the Colombo North Teaching Hospital in Ragama. But, two of them – the lawmaker and his security officer – had succumbed to their injuries.

At the time of the accident, the group had been returning from a wedding ceremony held at a hotel in Bandarawatta, Chilaw the previous night.
