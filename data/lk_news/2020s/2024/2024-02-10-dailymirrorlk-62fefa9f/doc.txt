The President revealed this during an exclusive interview with Indian news channel WION.

President Wickremesinghe, addressing concerns about China’s increased presence in the Indian Ocean region, stated, "....the island nation will not allow anything that would jeopardize India’s security."

The Sri Lankan leader emphasized, “We’ve kept Indian security in mind and we will not allow anything to happen that will be harmful to Indian security, and these are all hydrographical vessels.”
