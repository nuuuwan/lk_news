Strike at University of Ruhuna continues for fourth day

The strike action launched by all academic and non-academic staff trade unions, along with student unions affiliated with the University of Ruhuna, demanding the immediate removal of the Vice Chancellor, entered its fourth consecutive day today (Nov. 22).

All academic and non-academic trade unions affiliated with the University of Ruhuna had announced a continuous strike commencing from November 19, demanding the immediate removal of the university’s Vice Chancellor.

However, the University Trade Union Joint Committee (UTUJC), the Federation of University Teachers’ Trade Union Alliance, and the students’ representatives of that university held a discussion with Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya recently regarding the issue.

Speaking to the media following the discussion, Co-Chairman of the University Trade Union Joint Committee (UTUJC) Dhammika S. Priyantha stated “since assuming the role of Vice-Chancellor, he has imposed significant pressure on the academic staff, non-academic staff, and students, allegedly pursuing personal vendettas.”

Meanwhile, the Inter-University Students Federation (IUSF) also engaged in a Satyagraha in front of the Ministry of Education (MoE) and protested demanding the removal of the Vice Chancellor of Ruhuna University.

Later, they met the Secretary of the Ministry and held a discussion regarding the issue.
