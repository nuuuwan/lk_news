Samsung Sri Lanka offers 20-year warranty on refrigerators and washing machines

Samsung Sri Lanka, a premier name in consumer electronics, proudly continues its pioneering initiative: offering a 20-year warranty on Digital Inverter Motors in washing machines and Digital Inverter Compressors in refrigerators.

This extraordinary commitment underscores Samsung’s dedication to delivering durable, high-quality appliances while championing a sustainable lifestyle.

In a market where sustainability and longevity are crucial, Samsung Sri Lanka sets itself apart by providing this extensive warranty on its Digital Inverter technology. This initiative not only ensures customer peace of mind but also reduces the need for frequent appliance replacements, thereby minimising e-waste and promoting environmental sustainability. This warranty underscores the brand’s focus on innovation and consumer trust, promising extended durability and reliable performance.

Digital Inverter Technology (DIT) significantly enhances energy efficiency, performance, and the lifespan of large appliances. For instance, the Digital Inverter Motor, with its strong magnets, reduces friction, making washing machines quieter and smoother—ideal for open-plan living and budget maintenance. Its precise operations lower running costs for laundry loads, while its brushless design and fewer moving parts ensure a longer lifespan.

Similarly, the Digital Inverter Compressor in refrigerators operates at variable speeds, unlike standard single-speed compressors. This ensures high efficiency and consistent temperature, resulting in significant cost savings, a reduced carbon footprint, less noise, and a longer lifespan for the compressor. These technical advancements highlight Samsung’s commitment to energy conservation and operational efficiency.

With the vision to offer sustainable solutions to consumers, Samsung has introduced a 20-year warranty on the Digital Inverter Motors and Compressors used in washing machines and refrigerators, as frequent replacement of home appliances not only costs time and energy but also produces physical waste. Hence, this initiative aims at reducing e-waste while offering durability and peace of mind to consumers.

Samsung’s Digital Inverter Technology is recognised for its durability across all appliances. By extending the warranty for 20 years, Samsung assures consumers of the availability of parts required to maintain and service DITs throughout this period. This initiative significantly impacts the lifecycle of home appliances, promoting longer use and less frequent disposal, which aligns with global sustainability goals.

Believing that sustainability begins at home, Samsung incorporates innovative solutions in its kitchen and living appliances, supported by this extensive warranty. This approach promotes sustainable living, making Samsung’s products the natural choice for consumers seeking advanced, efficient refrigerators or washing machines that stand the test of time.

In addition to this ground-breaking warranty, Samsung Sri Lanka was recently named the Category Winner in the ‘Home Electronics’ category at the LMD Readers’ Most Loved Brands Awards 2024. This accolade, based on comprehensive surveys and evaluations of consumer feedback, brand perception, and market performance, reflects Samsung’s dominance in the industry and its commitment to excellence.

Furthermore, Samsung Sri Lanka holds the title of No.1 TV manufacturer for 18 consecutive years, showcasing its expertise and leadership in home entertainment. This consistent recognition reinforces Samsung’s reputation for producing state-of-the-art home electronics that meet the highest standards of quality and innovation.
