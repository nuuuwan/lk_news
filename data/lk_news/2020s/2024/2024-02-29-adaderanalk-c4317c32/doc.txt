Organic fertilizers to be included in Sri Lankaâ€™s national fertilizer policy

The Chair of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Food Security and Agriculture, Member of Parliament D. Weerasinghe said that the use of organic fertilizers should be included in the national fertilizer policy.

This was discussed when the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Food Security and Agriculture met in Parliament recently under the chairmanship of MP D. Weerasinghe, the Parliamentary Communications Department said in a statement.

Conceptual policies for food security prepared by the sub-committee of the National Council on the identification of priorities in the formulation of short, medium, and long-term national policies were considered on this day and the Sectoral Oversight Committee proposed to include several amendments to the plan, it added.

The Chair of the Committee said that the need to educate the farmers on the use of organic fertilizers has been communicated to the officials of the Department of Agriculture and accordingly plans will be made to educate the farmers in all areas. He also stated that he would visit directly the model agricultural farms where farming is done using organic fertilizers and find out the conditions.

Furthermore, the Chair of the Committee pointed out the need to encourage entrepreneurs who produce organic fertilizers, and a positive change can be made if a permanent national policy is implemented on the use of fertilizers in the country.

Members of Parliament Kapila Athukorala, Sudath Manjula and a group of government officials participated in this event, according to the Parliamentary Communications Department.
