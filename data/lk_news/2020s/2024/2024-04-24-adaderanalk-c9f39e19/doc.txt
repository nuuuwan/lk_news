Iran offers knowledge, expertise for Sri Lanka’s development and progress

Iran stands ready to share its knowledge, expertise and experience with Sri Lanka for the progress and development of the country, including partnerships in large-scale projects, says Iranian President Dr. Ebrahim Raisi.

The Iranian Head of State made these remarks after participating in the ceremony to inaugurate the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project (UOMDP) on Wednesday (24).

After declaring open the hydropower project, President Raisi promised to extend support for the developmental projects implemented on the island, through the provision of technical and engineering services.

He also asserted that Iran is ready to expand the bilateral ties with ‘all Asian countries, our neighbouring countries and sovereign and independent states.’

At a special invitation extended by his Sri Lankan counterpart, President Raisi arrived in Sri Lanka on Wednesday morning (24) on a one-day visit to foster ties between the two nations.

His arrival marks the first visit of an Iranian President to Sri Lanka since former President Dr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s visit in April 2008.

Shortly after his arrival, President Raisi participated in the public ceremony to inaugurate the USD 514-million hydropower project UOMDP which aims to alleviate water scarcity in the southeastern dry region of the country by redirecting an annual average of 145 million cubic meters (MCM) of excess water from the Uma Oya basin to the Kirindi Oya basin.

“I extend my gratitude to Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe for inviting me to participate in this event. It is indeed a tremendous honour to be involved in such a symbol of unity, one that deepens the bond between our nations.

“It is worth noting that this project stands as a testimony to the friendship shared between Iran and Sri Lanka. Today marks the official inauguration of this remarkable multipurpose development program.

“However, I believe that the main point of this is fostering utmost cooperation, integration, harmony, and unity not only between our two countries and among the nations across the Asian region.

“It’s important to emphasize that the resolve and commitment of the people in both our nations outweigh the completion of this project.

“President Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe, I would like to express that the Islamic Republic of Iran stands prepared to share its contemporary technological expertise with Sri Lanka.

“Furthermore, we affirm our readiness to impart the knowledge acquired by Iran over the past 45 years to foster the advancement and development of Sri Lanka. I assure you that Iran is eager to forge a strong partnership with Sri Lanka, poised to contribute to its growth and development. Iran stands prepared to offer technical and engineering services for significant development initiatives in Sri Lanka.”
