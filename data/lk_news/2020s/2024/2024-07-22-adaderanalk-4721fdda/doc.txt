Man clubbed to death by son-in-law in Sainthamaruthu

A 66-year-old person has been attacked to death with a metal rod in the Sainthamaruthu area yesterday (21), the police said.

The daughter of the deceased had separated from her husband 08 years ago while there is an ongoing court case with regard to that.

Despite the court case, her husband had attempted to unlawfully enter their house in the early hours of yesterday by jumping over the wall.

At that time, the father of the suspect’s wife had intervened by pushing him out of the house.

It was then that the daughter’s husband had allegedly attacked his father-in-law with a metal rod.

The victim who was critically injured from the incident has succumbed to injuries upon admission to the hospital, the police said.

Police have arrested the husband of the victim’s daughter who committed the murder and four other persons who aided him.

The suspects are aged 33, 20, 19, 18, and 16 and are residents of the Sainthamaruthu area.
