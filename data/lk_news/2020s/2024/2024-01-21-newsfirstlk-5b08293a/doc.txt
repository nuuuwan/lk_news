Cardinal Ranjith Calls for Leaders Aligned with Updated Laws

COLOMBO (News 1st);Â Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith asserted that Sri Lanka's issues cannot be solved with outdated laws and leaders who ignore the country's unique context.

Speaking during the feast at the St. John the Baptist's Church in Mutwal on Sunday (21) morning, he emphasized the need for leaders with an attitude "that fits the culture and suits the country" to effectively address the nation's problems.

The Cardinal challenged the notion that simply following the agendas of other parties will bring solutions. He stressed the importance of realistic, locally-tailored approaches.

He argued that societal change is not achieved through strict laws and burdening the people.
