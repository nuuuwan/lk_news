Namal Rajapaksa arrives at CID

Former Member of Parliament Namal Rajapaksa arrived at the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) at around 9.00 a.m. this morning to provide a statement, Ada Derana Reporter said.

Responding to a question from journalists as to why he was summoned to the CID, Namal responded saying that he was unsure and needed to find out the reason himself.

In response to further inquiries, he stated, “I don’t know the matter.  It’s better to be called in. The only way to get rid of the accusations against us is to come here. Because some lie with conviction. We are not those who lie with conviction. We will go and give our statement with conviction and come.”
