Team Barishal, Shoaib Malik dismisses match-fixing rumors in BPL

Jan. 26 (Cricketpakistan) - It was circulating on social media that Malik's contract has been terminated due to match-fixing suspicions

Former Pakistan captain. Shoaib Malik,Â  who was currently participating in the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) as a member of Fortune Barishal, has had his contract terminated amid suspicions of involvement in match-fixing.

Reports from the Bangladesh media suggest that suspicions of match-fixing arose when Malik bowled three no-balls in a single over during the match against Khulna Tigers in the BPL.

Malik's bowled one over in the match, where he conceded 18 runs, with two boundaries and a six. Unfortunately, Barishal ended up losing the match by 8 wickets.

Prior to the revelation of these suspicions, Malik had planned to go to Dubai for personal reasons, and Barishal had officially announced his absence from the remaining matches. However, recent reports indicate that the owner of Barishal has decided to abruptly terminate his contract.

Furthermore, it was circulating on social media that Malik's contract has been terminated due to match-fixing suspicions.

However. Barishal team's media manager, Sikander, has dismissed the claims and information from the Bengali media while talking to Cricket Pakistan. His stance is that Malik was willing to come back and play on February 6, but his proposal was not accepted, leading to the termination of the contract through mutual agreement.

On the other hand, speaking to Cricket Pakistan, Malik refuted media reports, stating that he was in Dubai due to pre-arranged personal commitments and wanted to return and play, but the league administration did not agree. The rest of the details are all nonsense.
