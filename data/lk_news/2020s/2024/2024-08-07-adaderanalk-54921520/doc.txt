Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, SLPP founder Basil Rajapaksa, and several other party members also attended the event.

Namala Rajapaksa had been tipped to be named as the SLPP’s presidential candidate after SLPP MP Dhammika Perera decided to withdraw from the race citing personal reasons.

The business magnate informed the party yesterday (6) that he will not contest the 2024 Presidential Election due to personal reasons.

Hence, the party leadership had decided to name an alternate candidate.

Rajapaksa, 38, is the youngest candidate in this election and if he wins, he will emerge as the youngest President int he history of Sri Lanka.
