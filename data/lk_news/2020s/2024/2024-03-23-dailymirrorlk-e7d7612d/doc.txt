Government with simple majority not enough to make expected change: Tilvin

Puttalam, March 23 (Daily Mirror)- Claiming that a government with a simple majority is not sufficent to make the expected social change and revive the bankrupt economy, NPP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said today that the NPP hopes to form a stronger government.

Speaking at the Puttalam District Women's Convention, he said the NPP must secure strong power to do anything.

"We have already won. But, we think there is no use of forming a government with 113 seats to make the expected social change. We must have stronger power to do whatever we want. Previous governments obtained stronger power to destroy the country. But, we need to obtain stronger power to restore the bankrupt country," he said.

De Silva said they will get together and form the first People's Government in Sri Lanka with massive people's force and trust, which cannot be toppled by rivals through acts of sabotage.
