‘Pharmaceutical sector of Sri Lanka has increasing potential to penetrate Vietnamese market’

The embassy of Sri Lanka in collaboration with Export Development Board (EDB) organized a webinar on “Sri Lankan Pharmaceutical Industry” for Vietnamese pharmaceutical companies a couple of days before the Medipharm Expo 2024 in Ho Chi Minh (HCM) city. This was organized in order to raise the awareness as well as stress the potential of the Sri Lankan pharma sector to leading importers and manufacturers of pharma in Viet Nam. The webinar was attended by over 100 pharma companies in Viet Nam, the Drug Authority of Viet Nam and the Viet Nam Pharmaceutical Association, along with Sri Lankan pharma companies which are participating in the aforementioned Medipharma Expo 2024.

Ambassador A. Saj U Mendis, delivering the welcome remarks, mentioned that although pharmaceutical manufacturing in Sri Lanka is modest in its scale and scope when compared with Viet Nam, the quality of drugs produced in Sri Lanka is quite high and impressive, adhering to international standards such as those of ISO, WHO and EU GMP requirements. Ambassador Mendis further stated that the Sri Lankan pharma companies are much eager and keen to associate with, engage with and form joint ventures and to export to the Vietnamese market. He further stated that Viet Nam boasts a large pharma market in excess of USD 10 billion and envisages reaching USD 16 billion within the next couple of years. Mendis further added that Viet Nam is a rapidly developing economy, which could be described as being among the fastest growing economies in the world, with a population of 100 million.

On the same note, ambassador Mendis said that Sri Lanka’s pharmaceutical market is around USD 750 million, of which 85% is imported and the remaining 15% locally produced. Government has allocated pharma-making zones in Hambantota within 200 acres with the intention of attracting FDIs and joint ventures in order to increase domestic production of medicines and pharma. Further, generous tax holidays for exports, 0% duty & taxes on imported capital goods & raw materials, 100% repatriation of capital and profits, dividends exempt from income and withholding taxes to non-resident entities are some of the compelling incentives extended to foreign pharma companies in this specifically identified and dedicated zone.

Mendis earnestly implored and urged Vietnamese companies to seriously consider investing and engaging in the pharma sector of Sri Lanka, given a number of efficacious trade agreements and FTAs with many countries in the region. This would enable select Vietnamese pharma companies to manufacture pharma products in Sri Lanka at competitive cost and to market not only in Sri Lanka but also to export to the region consisting of well over 40% of the global population.

Dr Kingsley Bernard, chairman & CEO of EDB stated that the pharmaceutical sector has been identified as one of the most promising and emerging sectors of Sri Lanka, not only to be developed as an import substitution industry but also as an export-oriented industry which could not only earn but could save a large quantum of foreign exchange, thus mutually benefiting Sri Lanka and pharma corporates of Viet Nam. In Sri Lanka, around 25 pharmaceutical manufacturing companies are currently engaged in the manufacturing of a variety of pharmaceutical products.

A customized video was played on the “Sri Lankan Pharmaceutical Industry”, which embraced attention and enhanced interest of the Vietnamese audience as it provided first-hand experience of the industry. Kalana Hewamallika, president, Sri Lanka Pharmaceutical Manufacturers’ Association (SLPMA) making a presentation on “Pharmaceutical Industry of Sri Lanka”, mentioned that by 2030 SLPMA intends to produce 40% of local market requirements. While enlightening on the pharmaceutical products manufactured by different companies in Sri Lanka, he mentioned that at present, Sri Lanka exports medicines to Myanmar, Cambodia, Maldives, Seychelles, Japan and Philippines and Viet Nam is a new market they wish to penetrate.

Rohan Karunathilake, General Manager of Astron Ltd and Dinesh Kumar Athapaththu, Managing Director of Morison Ltd, presented in detail about their respective companies and products and their meticulous objectives in the Viet Nam market. This was followed by a Q&A session, which clarified questions and elucidated issues to the Vietnamese audience.
