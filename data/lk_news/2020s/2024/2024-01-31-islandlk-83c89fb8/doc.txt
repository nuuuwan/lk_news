New Veet Pure with revolutionary features unveiled in grand style

Veet, the global leader in depilatory products, recently celebrated a significant milestone with the launch of ‘New Veet Pure’ in the Sri Lankan market. This improved product introduces revolutionary features, and the unveiling event was a glamorous affair attended by some of Sri Lanka’s most popular and inspiring female personalities, including the likes of Umaria Sinhawansa, an acclaimed vocal talent; Rozzanne Diasz, an icon in the Sri Lankan fashion and modeling industry; and Hasini Gunasekara, a well-known beautician and entrepreneur, among others.

Positioned as the #NextBigThing in hair removal, ‘New Veet Pure’ distinguishes itself through several innovative features. One standout characteristic is its long-lasting fresh fragrance, transforming the hair removal experience in a groundbreaking way. The product is available in three variants tailored to different skin types: Dry Skin (made from the essence of Grape Seed Oil), Normal Skin (made from Cucumber extract), and Sensitive Skin (made from Aloe Vera extract).

With all the new specialties, New Veet Pure emerges as the epitome of convenience, effectiveness, and safety, setting it apart from commonly used, less safe methods like shaving. Even in comparison to more expensive alternatives such as salon waxing, New Veet Pure stands out as a quick, hassle-free solution which is both economical yet delivers optimal results. New Veet Pure is the outcome of extensive and rigorous research and development processes and all variants have been dermatalogically tested to ensure safety and effectiveness.

Breaking away from traditional product launch norms, the New Veet Pure launch revolved around a panel discussion featuring key guests Umaria, Rozzanne, and Hasini Gunasekara. The discussion centered on the significance of self-esteem, confidence, and personality in overcoming challenges faced by modern Sri Lankan women. The event underscored a core aspect of Veet’s popularity – a commitment to go beyond being merely a hair removal product and to empower the modern woman as a companion in her journey.
