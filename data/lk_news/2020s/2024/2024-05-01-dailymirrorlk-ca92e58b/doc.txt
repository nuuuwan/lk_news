Weather today: Rain after 2 p.m in several areas

Colombo, May 1 (Daily Mirror) - Thundershowers will occur at several places in the Western, Sabaragamuwa and Central Provinces and in the Galle and Matara districts after 2.00 p.m, the Meterology Department said.

Misty conditions can be expected at some places in the Central, Sabaragamuwa and Uva Provinces during the morning.

The sea areas off the coast, extending from Balapitiya to Pottuvil via Galle and Hambantota can be fairly rough at times. The other sea areas around the island will be slight but strong gusty winds and very rough seas can be expected during thundershowers.

Winds will be south-westerly or variable and speed of 30 kmph, which may increase up to 45 kmph at times in the sea areas off the coasts extending from Puttalam to Trincomalee via Mannar and Kankesanthurai.

Therefore, the public is requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary, localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers
