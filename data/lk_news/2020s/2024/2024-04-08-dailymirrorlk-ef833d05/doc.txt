Sri Lanka defaults on USD 6 billion payment despite rising reserves: Patali

Colombo, April 8 (Daily Mirror) - United Republican Front (URF) leader Patali Champika Ranawaka said Sri Lanka defaulted on a payment of USD 6 billion starting from April 2022 when the country announced bankruptcy.

He said this was the reality though the Central Bank data show the increase of foreign reserves to USD 5 billion.

"While CBSL data shows Sri Lanka's foreign reserves reaching USD 5 billion, it is imperative to understand that from April 2022, the sum of defaulted debt is approximately USD 6 billion. The sum of loans obtained since the default from the World Bank, ADB, and IMF is USD 3 billion," he posted on X.
