Public confidence in major institutions increases after Presidential poll: Survey

Polling by the Institute for Health Policy’s Sri Lanka Opinion Tracker Survey (SLOTS) has revealed significant improvements in Sri Lankans’ confidence in institutions following the Presidential Election in September 2024.

IHP said the Supreme Court remains the most trusted institution, followed by the courts and tri forces.

Confidence in the Supreme Court and courts more than doubled, rising from 30% before the election to 72% and 62%, respectively, afterward.

Similarly, confidence in trade unions and parliament showed positive shifts following the Presidential Election. However, confidence in the Police remained relatively unchanged, with 32% expressing little or no confidence, IHP said.
