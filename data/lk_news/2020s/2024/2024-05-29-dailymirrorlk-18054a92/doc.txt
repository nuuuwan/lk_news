Our pleas ignored but we will not give up: Cardinal

Colombo, May 29 (Daily Mirror) -  The request by the church to conduct a proper investigation into the Easter Sunday bomb attacks is being ignored by the authorities. But they will renew their struggle and will fight for justice, Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith said.

Cardinal Ranjith made this remark after paying his last respects to Tilina Harashni who died on Monday after suffering for five years due to  the injuries she suffered as a result of the Easter Sunday bombings in 2019.

"We pray for Tilina who underwent immense suffering for five years after the bomb attack," the Cardinal added.
