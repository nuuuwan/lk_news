World Bank help to restructure US$800mn debt in Sri Lanka water sector

ECONOMYNEXT – The World Bank will help Sri Lanka restructure the 800 million dollar debt in its water sector, Minister of Water Supply Jeevan Thondaman has said.

“With the World Bank’s help, Sri Lanka will restructure its $800 million of debt in the water sector, have access to credit enhancement schemes that will make new water projects transparent and affordable and put us on a secured path to achieve SDG6,” Thondaman said on social media platform X (twitter).

The minister met with the Global Director for Water for the World Bank Saroj Jha in Bali at the 10th World Water Forum.

“Since our first meeting in December, Saroj has come forward to provide the full support of the World Bank for the ambitious reforms we are doing in Sri Lanka’s water sector.

“I look forward to working with World Bank Water and deepening our partnership.”

In February this year the minister said Sri Lanka was also working with the Asian Development Bank to get 200 million US dollars of loans linked to water sector reforms.

The government has been implementing IMF-led pricing policies on utilities, and the Water Supply Ministry has already come up with a formula that has been developed with the help of the Asian Development Bank. (Colombo/May20/2024)
