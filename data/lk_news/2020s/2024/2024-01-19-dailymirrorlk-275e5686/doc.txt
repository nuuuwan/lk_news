Specialists threaten strike action over Karapitya Hospital incident

Karapitiya, Jan 18 (Daily Mirror) -Â  Referring to the arrest of the Onco Surgeon at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital after being allegedly accused of having assaulted a female hospital staffer, the specialists have warned of a strike action over the incident.

In a formal letter addressed to the director of the Karapitiya Hospital, the Karapitiya branch of the Association of Medical Specialists (AMS) has urged for an urgent, impartial inquiry into the matter and a swift restoration of normal services.

The AMS points out that the disruption of cancer-related clinical work during trade union actions is not in line with the usual practice across the island. Specifically, on January 16, 2024, the onco-surgical unit experienced disruptions and compromises during surgical operations due to Trade Union Actions (TUA). Dr. S.C.R. Perera, a Senior Consultant Oncological Surgeon, filed a complaint expressing concern about the disruption of cancer surgery.

On the following day (January 17), Dr. S.C.R. Perera faced a life-threatening mob attack when he visited the Director's office.

The AMS emphasizes the need for immediate attention to the continuous harassment faced by their senior colleague, hindering his work and the provision of cancer care in the institution.

However, the 61-year-old Onco Surgeon who was arrested by the Galle Police has been remanded until January 22.

Meanwhile, the Health Ministry has launched an investigation into the incident.

The incident unfolded during a contentious situation that erupted at the hospital premises.

The arrest follows a heated argument that transpired on Wednesday morning, where the Senior Oncologist had allegedly assaulted the staff member.
