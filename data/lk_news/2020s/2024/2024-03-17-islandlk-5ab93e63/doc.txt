Madushanka returns home with hamstring injury

Left-arm seamer Dilshan Madushanka is returning home from Bangladesh after picking up a hamstring injury during the second ODI between the teams on Friday.

Madushanka walked off to the dressing room middle of his seventh over and did not return to the field. The injury ruled him out of the tour and he will return home. Sri Lanka have not asked for a replacement and are expected to play Chamika Karunaratne for the deciding final ODI.

The series is levelled at 1-1. Today’s third ODI is a day game and provides both sides a good chance to win the series as the dew will be out of the equation.

Madushanka will be out of the initial stages of the Indian Premier League due to the injury. The fast-bowling sensation from deep down south fetched more than half a million dollars from Mumbai Indians’ during the IPL auction.

Sri Lanka are plagued by injuries with Dushmantha Chameera and Asitha Fernando both out of the bilateral series against Bangladesh with injuries.
