Aragalaya activists raise election postponement conspiracy concerns with ECSL

People’s Struggle Alliance’s Wasantha Mudalige accuses President Ranil Wickremesinghe of engaging in discussions to prolong his tenure in power through potential election delays

Stresses Wickremesinghe nor SLPP has a mandate to unilaterally decide on election schedules

Seeks assurance from ECSL on its preparedness to conduct elections in accordance with constitutional mandates

Reaffirms commitment to defending democratic processes to safeguard SL’s electoral system against any threats

Members of the People’s Struggle Alliance (PSA) yesterday held a discussion with the Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL) to address growing apprehensions regarding potential efforts by the Government to postpone upcoming elections.

Represented by activists Wasantha Mudalige, Lahiru Weerasekara, Dharmasiri Lankapeli, and others, the PSA expressed deep concerns to the ECSL about what they perceive as a Government conspiracy to delay the electoral process. Mudalige emphasised the paramount importance of upholding democratic principles and ensuring elections are conducted on schedule.

Speaking to the media, Mudalige highlighted recent remarks by President Ranil Wickremesinghe at a Matara rally where he indicated intentions to consult with all parties on the timing of general elections. While acknowledging the President’s authority to dissolve Parliament and call for elections, Mudalige questioned his involvement in the election scheduling process as indicated by these statements.

“The President and the Government are engaging in discussions aimed at prolonging their tenure in power,” Mudalige alleged.

He further underscored that neither the President nor the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has the mandate to unilaterally decide on election schedules. “The people revoked the SLPP’s mandate on 9 July 2022. Therefore, we cannot allow any manoeuvres that compromise the democratic rights of the people,” Mudalige cautioned, issuing a stern warning against any attempts to delay elections.

During their meeting with the Election Commission, Mudalige and his delegation sought reassurances regarding the commission’s readiness to conduct elections in compliance with constitutional obligations. Mudalige said the Election Commission assured the alliance of its proactive planning and utilisation of constitutional powers to ensure elections proceed as planned.

“We remain steadfast in defending democratic processes,” Mudalige reiterated, pledging the PSA’s commitment to mobilise public support in safeguarding the integrity of Sri Lanka’s electoral system against perceived threats.

The PSA consists of activists, political parties and civil society organisations which were part of the 2022 Aragalaya movement in Sri Lanka.
