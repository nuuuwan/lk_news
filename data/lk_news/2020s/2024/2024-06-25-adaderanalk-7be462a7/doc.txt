UNDP offers submersible water pumps for flood relief assistance efforts in Sri Lanka

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Sri Lanka has handed over 10 units of submersible water pumps to the Disaster Management Center (DMC) for flood response efforts in the Kalutara, Colombo, and Galle districts.

The pumps were handed over by Ms. Malin Herwig, Officer-In-Charge of UNDP in Sri Lanka to, State Minister of Defense of Sri Lanka Premitha Bandara Tennakoon.

The submersible water pumps will support efforts to cleaning flood-affected dug wells, providing immediate disaster relief to around 15,000 affected families across these districts.

According to the DMC, numerous dug wells, which serve as the primary source of safe drinking water for the affected communities, are in urgent need of immediate cleanup. This action is essential to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases in the aftermath of the floods, the UNDP said in a statement.

The DMC has underscored that the rehabilitation of these wells is one of the most critical early recovery measures required for the affected communities across the flood-impacted districts. The prompt and efficient cleaning of these wells will help restore access to safe drinking water and significantly contribute to the health and well-being of the local populations during the recovery phase, it added.

Major General (Retired) Udaya Herath, Director General, DMC; Mr. Chathura Liyanaarchchi, Director of Preparedness, DMC; Dr. Buddika Hapuarachchi, Policy Specialist and Team Leader, Climate and Environment, UNDP Sri Lanka; Mr. Vajira Hettige, Technical Coordinator, Climate and Environment, UNDP Sri Lanka and Mr. Manjula Bandara, Field Coordinator, Climate and Environment, UNDP Sri Lanka were also present at the occasion, according to the UNDP.
