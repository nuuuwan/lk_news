Train strike called off

Colombo, June 10 (Daily Mirror) - The Sri Lanka Railways Locomotive Operating Engineersâ€™ Union decided to call off their ongoing strike following discussion with the Transport Minister.

The union said the trains in the evening will not run as usual, but the services will return to normal by tomorrow morning.

Only a few trains will be cancelled this evening, and the locomotive engineers and the General Manager, Railways are aware of this.

The Locomotive Operating Engineers Union launched their strike on Friday due to delays in the second-class promotions of locomotive drivers, continuous delays in recruitments due to the lack of a salary code, and other issues.
