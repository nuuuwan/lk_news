Classy scene…

Terry & The Big Spenders will be doing their thing at the Shangri-La, in Colombo, for the next six months.

The eight-piece band is now featured on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.

Terry & The Big Spenders are probably the only outfit, with a horn section, performing on a regular basis.

The music they dish out is predominantly vintage, says Viraj Perera, the leader of this versatile outfit.

“It’s a lot of jazz, soul, Latin and funk and those who enjoy those classic ballads, from the ’60s to ’80s, are our big followers.”

Late in the evening, at the mentioned venues, you could take the floor and dance to those classic ballads, says Viraj.

And…Viraj added that Terry and the Big Spenders have always been about class.
