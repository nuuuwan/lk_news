Sri Lanka’s NSB subsidiary staff to be offered VRS: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Staff of State-owned National Savings Bank subsidiary, Sri Lanka Savings Bank, will be offered a voluntary retirement scheme, Cabinet spokesman minister Bandula Gunawardena said.

NSB has decided to take over the assets and liabilities of SLSB and absorb its employees.

“It has been decided to introduce a voluntary retirement scheme and make a payment taking into account the market factors for the employees who retire voluntarily. If they don’t take the VRS offer, they will be absorbed into the National Savings Bank workforce,” Gunawardena told reporters Tuesday.

Established in 2006, the State-run Sri Lanka Savings Bank is a successor to the failed Pramuka Savings and Investment Bank.

SLSB was acquired by the State-owned National Savings Bank (NSB) in October 2019. SLSB benefited from NSB ownership in terms of capital, operational and managerial support, a subsequent rating review noted. (Colombo/May14/2024)
