Did you mark your vote with pen or pencil? - EC clarifies concerns

The Election Commission states that it has received complaints regarding the use of pencils instead of pens at certain polling stations for the marking of votes during the 2024 Presidential Election.

In response to this, the election regulatory body had issued instructions to all relevant polling centers to use carbon pens going forward, addressing concerns about the integrity of the voting process.

Despite the complaints, the Election Commission has reassured that any ballot papers marked with pencils will not be invalidated.

Issuing an announcement in this regard, the Election Commission clarified that all votes marked with either pen or pencil will be considered as valid.
