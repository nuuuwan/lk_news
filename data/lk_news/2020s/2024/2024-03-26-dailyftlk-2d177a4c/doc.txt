The successful bid for this monumental project reflects SLPG’s unwavering dedication to reliability, professionalism, and unparalleled technical knowledge.

Mr. Jonah Goh, Director and Chief Executive Officer of BPTL also commented, stating “What I have learned from this collaboration is that Sino Lanka knows how to put their customer first, and that is something very impressive for us to learn. If given a choice to do this exercise again, Sino Lanka would not be my preferred choice, but my first and only choice. I also want to congratulate Sino Lanka, the Best Pacific Engineering Team, and our Special Project Manager, Wing Commander Kosala Ranasinghe (Retd) for getting this project off the ground so quickly, as well as to Mr. Hasitha Premarathne MD of Brandix who is our joint partner in the apparel industry.”

This initiative empowers Best Pacific to reach their sustainability objectives, reduce carbon emissions in production, and support their portfolio of esteemed clients in achieving carbon neutrality.”

Mr. Iroshan Wickramasinghe, Head of Engineering SLPG also shared his thoughts, “As we navigate towards a green and sustainable future, harnessing solar energy has become a must. So, to do this efficiently and safely, we have to look at the system details such as product quality, installation standards, safety features, and adherence to international standards. In keeping up with these factors, we designed a solar PV system best suited for Best Pacific.”

SLPG’s expertise lies in developing rooftop solar PV systems, offering services including Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC), Revenue Share Agreements, and the Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) model.
