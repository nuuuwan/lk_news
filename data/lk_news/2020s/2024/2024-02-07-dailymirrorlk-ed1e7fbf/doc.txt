Colombo, Feb 07 (Daily Mirror) - An island-wide police operation targeting individuals who commit acts of abuse against children and women in public transport has been initiated.

The Public Security Ministry said the operation's primary objective is to combat sexual abuse within public transport services, addressing the increasing number of complaints received by police stations on a daily basis.

Acting Inspector General of Police Deshabandu Tennakoon has directed the implementation of this operation.

The IGP instructed the police to prioritize operations between 08:00-10:00 and 17:00-19:00, emphasizing peak hours of public transport usage.

Accordingly, police officers in civilian clothes will travel in buses, with special attention being paid to streets, bus stops and railway stations.

Police said arrangements have been made to deploy groups of police officers in uniforms, especially covering the main roads, ready to provide assistance to the officers travelling in civilian clothes when they need assistance.
