Sri Lanka Water Board to sell under formula from 2025

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet of ministers has approved a cost-based price formula for state-run National Water Supply and Drainage Board, Minister Bandula Gunawardana said.

The price formula will be implemented from next year, Minister Gunawardana told reporters Tuesday.

The price formula is part of reforms linked to a 100 million US dollar budget support loan from the Asian Development Bank.

The Water Board hiked rates after years of running losses, following an economic collapse which also pushed up costs.

Though the Water Board is now making operational profits, it is not making cashflow to settle loans. (Colombo/July16/2024)
