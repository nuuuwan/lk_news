Rohitha Abeygunawardhane attempted to assault me: Rasamanickam

Colombo, March 07 (Daily Mirror) - Parliamentarian Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam said MP Rohitha Abeygunawardhane threatened him and attempted to physically assault him in the Prime Minister's Office in Parliament today.

Raising a privileges issue in Parliament, he said MP Abeygunawardhane threatned him for walking into the Prime Minister's Office.

"How dare you walked into our Prime Minsiter's office?", he questioned and threatened me and tried to physically assault me threatening me to meet him by the lift. State Minister Ashoka Priyantha, who was there, prevented him. My life is under threat," the MP said.

He said the Prime Minister is the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka and he had all the rights to meet him as a Member of Parliament and a citizen of this country.

Rohitha Abeygunawardane, who responded said, he only asked him to meet by the lift to see him off safely. "I have been there in Parliament for last 25 years. I have never threatened Tamil MPs. I asked him why he came to the Prime Minister's office and asked him to meet by the lift to take him safely," he said.

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said it was a serious matter to threatened a MP in that manner and requested the Speaker to look into the matter.

The Deputy Speaker said the matter would be brought into the attention of the Speaker.
