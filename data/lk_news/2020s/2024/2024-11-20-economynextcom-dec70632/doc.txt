Sri Lanka’s new government committed to work with India: FM

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s foreign minister Vijitha Herath said the new National People’s Power government is committed to working with India to strengthen bilateral ties.

“I also wish to reiterate our commitment to work with India to further strengthen our civilizational links & the excellent bilateral cooperation for the mutual benefit of our peoples,” Herath said on social platform X.

He was responding to India’s External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s congratulatory message.

“Look forward to working together to further strengthen our historic bonds of friendship and deepen our wide – ranging partnership for mutual benefit,” Jaishankar said on X after Herath was re-appointed as foreign minister this week.

Herath’s party the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, part of the NPP coalition, has been extremely critical of Indian investments in the island in the past, and behind protests that led to many projects being abandoned.

Herath told reporters on Tuesday that Sri Lanka’s President Anura Dissanayake will be visiting India to meet Indian Prime Minister Modi mid-December. (Colombo/Nov20/2024)
