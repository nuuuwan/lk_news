Another round of tomatoes…

My Beauty Tips with Tomato, last week, had some very good comments coming my way, via Messenger and WhatsApp, and quite a few readers wanted me, if possible, to do the needful, this week, too, with tomato.

I love going out of my way to oblige my readers and…yes, it’s tomato this week, as well.
