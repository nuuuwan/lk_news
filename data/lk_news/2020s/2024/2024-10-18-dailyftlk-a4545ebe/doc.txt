Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Former MP Dr. Harsha de Silva has revealed that party leader Sajith Premadasa has urged SJB candidates not to undermine President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, emphasising the need to be prepared to collaborate with him.

“He has advised us not to undermine the President, as he will be in office for the next five years. We must work with him. We have a strong team and a clear program, and we believe we can effectively collaborate with the President,” de Silva explained.

These comments were made by de Silva after a meeting with SJB Parliamentary Election candidates in Colombo yesterday, organised under the leadership of Sajith Premadasa.

Responding to media inquiries, de Silva highlighted that Premadasa stressed the importance of the party focusing on winning the upcoming elections, aiming for 113 seats in Parliament to establish a SJB Government.

“The party is currently committed to making Sajith Premadasa the Prime Minister,” he noted.

Regarding the current Government’s economic plans and decisions, de Silva refrained from criticism, acknowledging that he would face backlash for undermining the administration. “We previously communicated what can be done and what cannot be done. However, it was not accepted by the public,” he remarked.
