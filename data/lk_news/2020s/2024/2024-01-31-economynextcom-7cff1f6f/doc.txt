Sri Lanka inflation rises to 6.5-pct in Jan 2024, above 5.0-pct target

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s inflation in the 12-months to January 2023 by the widely watched Colombo Consumer Price Index was 6.5 percent, higher than the statutory 5 percent target but below the 2.0 percent variation allowed.

The index rose 2.9 percent in the month, with a 3 percent hike in value added tax hitting most goods and services and some that did not have value added tax earlier.

The CCPI index was up 6.0 percent since September 2022, when monetary stability was reached.

The central bank has been conducting broadly deflationary policy, triggering a balance of payments surplus and had also allowed the exchange rate to appreciate, which helps reduce prices measured in Sri Lanka rupees.

Food prices rose 3.8 percent during the month, with some vegetables seeing steep increases after floods. Non-foods rose 2.5 percent. (Colombo/Jan31/2023)
