SJB Jaffna District Organiser pledges support to President

SJB Jaffna District Organiser Victor Stanley yesterday pledged support to President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the next month’s election.

Stanley stated that Sajith Premadasa, who is currently seeking the country’s leadership, did not step forward to accept responsibility for the country and its people during the time of crisis. Those who remained silent while the people were under severe pressure are unfit for the leadership of the country, he added.

Stanley highlighted that the current President Wickremesinghe, who served in Parliament as a single MP, took on the challenge of rebuilding the country. The victory of President Wickremesinghe in the upcoming Presidential election will be a victory for the entire nation.

Following the pledging of support, Stanley was appointed as the Jaffna District Coordinator for Christian Affairs to President Wickremesinghe.
