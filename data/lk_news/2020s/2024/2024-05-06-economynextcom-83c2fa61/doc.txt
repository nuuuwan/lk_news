Sri Lanka children bearing brunt of heatwave: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s children are suffering from the current heatwave, with some hospital admissions recorded, Minister of Health Ramesh Pathirana said.

“In the mornings, in the assembly, children faint. They get exposed to the heat,” Pathirana told reporters on Monday.

“There have been a few hospital admissions, mainly due to faintings, headaches and dehydration,” Pathirana said. “But thankfully there aren’t many cases as such.”

Sri Lanka’s Meteorological Department has indicated that the maximum temperature in the last 24 hours was 39.1 degrees Celsius in Anuradhapura.

Authorities are cautioning people to stay out of the sun, hydrate, wear light or white clothing, and restrict strenuous activity. The elderly, children and those who are ill, face higher risk in the current heatwave. (Colombo/May6/2024)
