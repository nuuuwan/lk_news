Sajith is losing control of SJB: Palitha Range Bandara

Colombo, Feb 13 (Daily Mirror) - Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa is witnessing an erosion of control within his party, Samagi Jana Balwegaya (SJB), as several prominent members have conveyed their willingness to support the President, UNP General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara said today.

"The door is open for Sajith to join the UNP if he wants to survive. There is no reason for our leader to reject Mr. Premadasa into the party while he is currently working with his onetime rival, SLPP," Range Bandara added.

"Some prominent members of the SJB have informed us that they are willing to support President Wickremesinghe and that they would leave the party at the right time. Therefore, the SJB leader will lose control of the party before long," UNP General Secretary told a briefing.
