Government planning four-stage vehicle import resumption

Following discussions with vehicle importers, the government is focused on resuming vehicle imports in four stages, Finance State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

After the meeting, the State Minister claimed that vehicle importers are expected to deliver a report soon on the potential impact of lifting vehicle import restrictions.

He said the report will include detailed information on the relaxation of import restrictions.

Minister Siyambalapitiya pointed out the importance of the report prepared by experts in the vehicle import sector, highlighting its significant role in the decision-making process for the resumption of vehicle imports.

During the discussion, vehicle importers suggested to the Finance State Minister that it would be more feasible to import vehicles under different categories instead of allowing all imports at once. They proposed categorizing vehicle imports for public transport, used vehicles and private vehicles.

Furthermore, various issues regarding problematic situations arising from tax payments were also discussed during the meeting.
