No failures in O/L exams after 2028: Minister

After 2028, there will be no failures in the GCE Ordinary Level (O/L) examinations, Education Minister Susil Premajayantha said.

While addressing an event held to distribute electric bicycles to rural areas with Hutch Telecommunications Company, he said the Ministry will allow all the students to study up to GCE (O/L) to select their path, whether to follow academic or vocational training.

Accordingly, the children need not leave their schools but can continue for another two years with their academic or vocational training. Subsequently, they will be directed to vocational training programmes.

"We have updated most of the programmes. A total of 4.3 million students are currently studying in 10,126 public schools, over 300 international schools, and over 110 private schools. Now we are in the process of transforming education. For the last 75 years, we followed the curriculum introduced by Britishers because we were under British rule," the Minister said.

Even in Britain the same curriculum is not found as they develop their methodologies drastically, he said.

"Therefore, it is time to transform education in the country, and it is one of the themes introduced by the IUNSCO in 2022.

"We want to deviate the education system from exam-centric education to practicals or introduce modules," Minister Premajayantha said.
