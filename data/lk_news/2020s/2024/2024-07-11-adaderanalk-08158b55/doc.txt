Hirunika’s bail application fixed for consideration

The Colombo High Court has fixed former Member of Parliament Hirunika Premachandra’s bail application to be taken up for consideration on July 15.

Colombo High Court Judge Amal Ranaraja issued this order following the Attorney General’s submission of objections against the relevant bail application this morning (11).

Former MP Hirunika Premachandra filed an appeal with the Appeals Court, requesting to invalidate the recent verdict issued by the Colombo High Court sentencing her to three years of rigorous imprisonment and seeking her acquittal from the case.

Accordingly, Premachandra’s lawyers also filed a bail application before the Colombo High Court requesting to release her on bail, since an appeal has been filed against the relevant verdict.

The former SJB parliamentarian was sentenced to three years of rigorous imprisonment after being found guilty of being involved in the abduction of a youth in the Dematagoda area on December 21, 2015, using a Defender and his wrongful detention.

Accordingly, Premachandra was found guilty of 18 charges and the court ordered that a fine of Rs. 20,000 be imposed for each charge. The order also stated that if the payment of the fines is defaulted, an additional 06 months imprisonment will be imposed for each charge.

Accordingly, former MP Hirunika Premachandra, who was sentenced to prison, is currently in the custody of prison officials.
