Govt. to gazette regulations on speed limits: Alagiyawanna

State Minister of Transport Lasantha Alagiyawanna on Thursday stated a gazette with the necessary regulations on speed limits, aimed at reducing road accidents, will be issued within the next two weeks.

He made this statement during a media briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC), said that the on-going strikes are motivated by political interests rather than genuine professional rights.

According to him, the National Council for Road Safety has allocated Rs. 50 million to the Sri Lanka Police for the purchase of necessary speed control equipment.

He also said arrangements have been made to provide teachers with manuals for establishing Road Safety Clubs at the school level. These clubs will be included in the school system as an extracurricular activity, and a medal awarding program has also been introduced.

“The Public Service Commission has already granted approval for the promotion of station masters every five years. The necessary Cabinet paper seeking approval from the Cabinet for this promotion has been prepared,” he pointed out.

“We have initiated several programs to enhance efficiency in the transport sector. Notably, the Kadawatha bus terminal is scheduled to be opened in August under the patronage of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. These bus terminals incorporate modern transport management methods and advanced technology,” he added.

In 2023, there were 2,214 reported road accidents resulting in 2,321 deaths. “As of 30 June 1,103 road accidents have been reported this year with 1,154 fatalities. To address this issue, our Ministry has implemented various programs aimed at reducing the number of road accidents,” he said.

However, it is evident to the public that the current strikes are motivated purely by political agendas. “It should be noted that these strikes do not stem from genuine professional grievances,” he added.
