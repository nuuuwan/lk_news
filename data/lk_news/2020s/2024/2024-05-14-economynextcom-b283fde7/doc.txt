Sri Lanka to allow renewable power wheeling

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will allow consumers to build renewable power plants and use the Ceylon Electricity Board transmission network to carry it to a different location to be used, Minister Bandula Gunawardana said.

So-called ‘wheeling’ was not allowed in Sri Lanka and a company that built a power plant had to sell the power to the Ceylon Electricity Board at the feed in price and buy power separately at as a customer at a retail tariff.

Wheeling allows customer to carry the power from a new renewable plant by paying a fee to the transmission network.

“For example if a mini-hydro plant is built in Kithulgala, the power can be carried through the grid for the use of a factory is Ja-Ela as long it is also owned by the same party for his own use,” Minister Gunawardana said.

A committee was appointed to conduct a detailed study and the recommendation was made he said. (Colombo/May15/2024)
