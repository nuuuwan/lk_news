Pathfinder Foun-dation yesterday welcomed a delegation from the International Trade Centre (ITC) based in Geneva, Switzerland led by Chief of Asia Pacific Sylvie Bétemps Cochin.

The delegation also included Associate Project Adviser Camille Roy and Associate Program Officer Vidya Nathaniel.

During the meeting, Cochin provided an in-depth overview of the ITC’s extensive work across the Asia Pacific region. She highlighted several key initiatives focused on promoting sustainable and inclusive trade. One of the primary topics discussed was green trade, with Cochin emphasising ITC’s efforts to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in adopting environmentally friendly practices. These efforts aim to help SMEs integrate into the global value chains while reducing their environmental impact. Cochin also highlighted the importance of sustainability and climate resilience in trade. She outlined various ITC projects designed to enhance the climate resilience of SMEs, ensuring they can withstand and adapt to the challenges posed by climate change. This includes initiatives on decarbonisation, which aim to reduce the carbon footprint of trade activities through innovative approaches and sustainable practices.

Another significant focus of the discussion was digital trade policies. Cochin explained how ITC is working to facilitate the digitalisation of trade processes, making it easier for businesses to engage in international trade efficiently and securely. This includes developing digital tools and platforms that streamline trade procedures and enhance transparency.

Trade facilitation was also a key topic, with Cochin highlighting ITC’s role in simplifying trade regulations and procedures to make it easier for businesses, especially SMEs, to participate in global trade. These efforts are crucial for promoting economic growth and development in the Asia Pacific region.

The visit from the ITC delegation underscored the importance of international cooperation and the role of organisations like ITC in driving sustainable and inclusive economic development. Pathfinder Foundation said it looks forward to continued collaboration with ITC to advance these vital initiatives.
