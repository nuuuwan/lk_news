SriLankan to fly daily to Seoul with Korean Air code share

ECONOMYNEXT – State-run SriLankan Airlines said it will increase its twice weekly flights from Colombo to Seoul to seven days a week with a code share agreement with Korean Air, with a connection in Singapore.

“The passenger traffic between the two cities continues to exceed our expectations,” Richard Nuttall, Chief Executive Officer of SriLankan Airlines said in a statement.

The partnership enables SriLankan Airlines to codeshare on flights operated between Singapore and Seoul Incheon by Korean Air.

Korean Air will codeshare on flights operated by SriLankan Airlines between Colombo and Seoul Incheon; Singapore; Chennai in India; and Male in the Maldives.

The collaboration will allow SriLankan Airlines to access Korean Air’s far eastern network, and Korean Air will gain access to SriLankan Airlines’ network in the Indian subcontinent, according to the statement. (Colombo/March/2024)
