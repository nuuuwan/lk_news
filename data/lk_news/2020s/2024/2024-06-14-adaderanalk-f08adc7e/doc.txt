“I might have to play cricket myself if this continues” - Sports Minister

Minister of Sports Harin Fernando, while speaking to the media this afternoon (14), expressed his views regarding Sri Lankan team’s early elimination from the ICC T20 World Cup 2024.

Accordingly, Fernando stated that continuous losing of matches in this manner has been an issue for several years and that a long-term solution is needed to solve the relevant issue.

The Sports Minister further alleged that the Sri Lanka Cricket was already suspended and everything was ‘messed up’ when he took over the relevant ministry.

In response to a question raised by a journalist regarding future steps for the development of cricket, Fernando jokingly said: “I hope to play cricket. You are asking what I can do as the Sports Minister to this issue? What can I do if they keep losing the matches? Then I will have to go and play cricket.”

“That is not possible. This issue was there for several years. We will need a long-term solution for this. This (SLC) was already suspended and everything was messed up when I took over the ministry”, he added.

Sri Lanka became the third team after Oman and Namibia to be officially knocked out of the 2024 T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and United States.

Following defeats in each of their first two games and a washout in their third encounter against Nepal in Florida, Sri Lanka needed a washout between Bangladesh and Netherlands in St. Vincent to stay alive in the tournament. A washout would have left both Bangladesh and Netherlands with three points each, in which case Sri Lanka would have had a mathematical chance to make it to the Super 8s, heading into the final round of fixtures in Group D.

But the completion of the fifth over of Netherlands’ chase — which ensured there would be a result in the contest, meaning one of Netherlands or Bangladesh would get to 4 points  — officially knocked Sri Lanka out of the tournament.

This result draws curtains on a shocking T20WC campaign for the 2014 champions. They entered the tournament with optimism but got embarrassed in their first group game, getting bowled out for 77 against South Africa.

Wanindu Hasaranga’s side then lost a close encounter against arch-rivals Bangladesh. There, they suffered a fatal collapse, finishing at 124/9 after being 100/3 at one stage.

Sri Lanka, thus, have failed to make it to the final four of the T20 World Cup for the fourth straight edition. They last made the last four in 2014 when they ended up winning the trophy by beating India in the final.
