Govt. nursing officers on 24-hour token strike today

The Government Nursing Officers’ Association has launched an island-wide 24-hour token strike with effect from 7:00 a.m. today (Jan.17).

Commenting in this regard, the national organizer of the association Sudath Jayasiri explained that the nursing officers decided to resort to a one-day token strike as the discussions held with the Health Minister and the State Minister for Finance were unfruitful.

Meanwhile, several other health trade unions that engaged in a token strike on Tuesday (Jan.16) have temporarily called off their trade union action at 6:30 a.m. this morning.

The president of Paramedical Services Front (PMSF) Upul Rohana, however, has vowed to resume the trade union action if the authorities fail to address their problems within a week’s time. He said around 100,000 health workers including all paramedical services, hospital secretaries, administrative officers as well as health administrative assistants, minor staff and 75 other trade unions of the health staff would join this island-wide strike.
