Police fire tear gas to disperse protesting university non-academic staff

Police have fired tear gas to disperse a protest march organized by the university non-academic staff near the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Ada Derana reporter said.

The non-academic staff members of state universities launched a one-day token strike this morning (Jan.18) in protest of the government’s decision to increase the allowances of lecturers.

Earlier this month, the Cabinet of Ministers green-lighted President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s resolution seeking to increase the study allowance granted to university lecturers by 25%. It was decided that this allowance would be included in their January salary.

However, the University Trade Union Joint Committee has taken issue with this Cabinet decision, complaining that increasing the salaries of lecturers has created unrest among the non-academic staff members.
