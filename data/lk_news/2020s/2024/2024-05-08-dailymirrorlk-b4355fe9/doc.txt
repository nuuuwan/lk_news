Basil reasserts general election first, yet President braces for presidential race

Colomo, May 8 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) founder Basil Rajapaksa reasserted yesterday that his party still believes the general election should precede the presidential elections but President Ranil Wickremesinghe has a contrasting stand, according to an informed source of the party.

Mr. Rajapaksa addressed the parliamentary group of the party and spelled out his opinion in this regard. Earlier, he met with the President and held talks about the latest political developments.

According to the SLPP, a fair number of its MPs stand for the conduct of the snap general election ahead of the presidential elections scheduled for October, this year in terms of the Constitution. The next parliamentary election is scheduled for 2025 only. However, the President has the constitutional authority to dissolve Parliament prematurely and declare a snap election.

Mr. Rajapaksa is reported to have instructed the MPs to brace for any election no matter what. The MPs were reportedly asked to start political work in preparation for any election that might come first.

Meanwhile, SLPP MPs who hold ministerial responsibilities in the government stand for the presidential elections to be conducted first. Earlier, Mr. Rajapaksa told the media that he would not leave room for any rift with the President over his stand.
