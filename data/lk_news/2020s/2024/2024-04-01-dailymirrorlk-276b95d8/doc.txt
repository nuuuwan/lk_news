Tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka surged past the 600,000 mark by 27 March, in nearly half the time compared to last year.

Provisional data from the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) revealed that tourist arrivals reached 608,475 in the first 27 days of March. By contrast, in 2023, the country reached the 600,000 mark towards the end of June.

Compared to the arrivals before the Covid pandemic and the Easter Sunday attacks, Sri Lanka successfully crossed the 700,000 mark by the end of March in 2018 and 2019.

As of March 27, 2024, Sri Lanka has welcomed a total of 181,872 international visitors. The weekly arrival average is about 46,000, with a daily average of about 6,700. At the current rate, tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka are projected to just about cross the 200,000 mark in March. Analysis of tourist arrival rates from 2015 shows that from the third month of the year, the influx of international visitors typically experiences a slowdown until the month of July.
