Flowyzer by 99x: Providing transparency and delivery insights for software product engineering teams

99x, a leading global product engineering company, unveils its latest innovation, Flowyzer, a developer-friendly environment to provide insights on the software product engineering process. Flowyzer empowers software developers and product companies with unparalleled transparency, enabling them to quantify and enhance their engineering flow for tangible business results.

Flowyzer is designed to deliver insights across multiple dimensions such as speed, productivity, quality, security, and team satisfaction. At present, it supports speed and productivity dimensions, with other dimensions planned in upcoming releases. Speed is measured through multiple metrics during software development based on the time taken for task pickup, coding, reviews, rework, and deployment. These metrics provide developers with a granular understanding of their product engineering process, facilitating the identification of bottlenecks and optimization opportunities. Productivity metrics include pull request (PR) throughput, PR loss rate, PR close rate, PR merge rate, commit size, code changes, and code churn. These metrics provide valuable insights into the pace and efficiency of software development workflows.

Suren Rodrigo, Chief Product Officer of 99x and Product Owner of Flowyzer said, “The platform enables the entire team to visualize how their engineering flow is working, setting the stage for continuous improvement. Information sharing is transparent and available to everyone equally.

Progress updates are based on data based on the work the team is doing, not on task-level time reporting. This reflects the real value addition provided by the team”. Suren also added, “Insights at both an individual level and team level are available. Individuals can see their performance and make necessary adjustments. For 99x, this allows us to add more value as a service provider as the insights are deeper, closer to the code itself”.
