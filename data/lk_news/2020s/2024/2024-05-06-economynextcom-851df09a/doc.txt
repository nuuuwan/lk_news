VFS Global issues statement on Sri Lanka visa deal

ECONOMNEXT – VFS Global, one of the companies involved in Sri Lanka’s high-priced visa deal, has issued statement saying its 18.50 dollar fee was approved by the cabinet of the island.

“Payment processing charges and applicable local taxes are in addition to the service fee,” the company said.

The shift of visa processing to the company has led to the doubling of Sri Lanka tourist visa to 100 dollars from 50, with the government charge going up to 75 dollars and company charging another 25 dollars plus in service fee and ‘convenience’ fees.

“The government benefits from increased efficiencies and transparency in managing the complete process and improved resource utilisation,” VFS said.

Sri Lanka’s Minister of Public Security said the deal was awarded without tendering and in any case nobody would have come forward to compete against VFS.
