Sri Lanka Planetarium to be closed to public

The Sri Lanka Planetarium will remain closed to the public from tomorrow (27) until March 12, the Education Ministry announced.

The decision to close the Planetarium stems from the necessity for urgent repairs. As such, access to the facility will be restricted during this period to facilitate the required maintenance work.
