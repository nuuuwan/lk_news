Fairly heavy showers expected in parts of the island

The Meteorology Department says several spells of showers will occur in Western, Sabaragamuwa and North-western provinces and in Kandy, Nuwara-Eliya, Galle and Matara districts.

Showers or thundershowers may occur at several places elsewhere of the island during the evening or night.

Fairly heavy showers above 50 mm are likely at some places in Eastern, Uva and Northern provinces, the department said.

The general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
