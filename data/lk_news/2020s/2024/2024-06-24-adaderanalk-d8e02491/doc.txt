Sri Lanka CERT issues warning over social media scams

The Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (SL CERT) urges the public to be cautious of fake messages purportedly sent by various banks, commercial institutions, and international organizations.

Issuing a statement, the Sri Lanka CERT stated that these scams promise donations, cash gifts, lucky draws, and job insurance, using the names of legitimate entities.

“Cyber criminals attempt to contact individuals through fake websites, social media platforms, SMS, and WhatsApp. By accessing the links provided in these messages, they can steal data from computers and mobile phones, leading to various forms of abuse and financial fraud”, it added.

The Sri Lanka CERT reports that these types of crimes have been increasing recently, with a growing number of victims. Fraudsters often operate around national and religious festivals, exploiting the public’s trust during these times, warned SL CERT.

In response, Sri Lanka CERT and other organizations have launched extensive awareness campaigns. Despite these efforts, the number of complaints from victims continues to rise due to ignorance and neglect, the statement mentioned.

Furthermore, Sri Lanka CERT advises the public to verify any suspicious messages by visiting the official websites of the respective institutions, contacting them through official phone numbers, or making inquiries before responding to such messages on the internet and social media.

Sri Lanka CERT further requests the public to refrain from opening or responding to unverifiable messages, emphasizing the importance of staying vigilant against these scams.
