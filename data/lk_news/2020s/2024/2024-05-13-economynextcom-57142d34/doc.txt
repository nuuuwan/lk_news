ECONOMYNEXT – Orion (Development) has signed an agreement with the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka for 1.78 million dollars to further develop its IT park with a ‘new ecosystem’.

“Signed an agreement with Board of Investment of Sri Lanka for U$ 1.78 Mn expanding Orion Colombo, and Orion Nest to the next level,” the BoI said on X (twitter).

Orion Development built Sri Lanka’s first IT Park in 2009 aiming to offer built-to-specification commercial and office infrastructure.

Orion City has said it plans to further strengthen its sustainable infrastructure by transitioning to renewable energy, particularly solar power, by installing solar panels to reduce reliance on traditional energy sources.

“Our goal for Phase II of Orion Tower is to achieve LEED Platinum certification setting a high standard in sustainable building practices,” Orion officials have said. (Colombo/May13/2024)
