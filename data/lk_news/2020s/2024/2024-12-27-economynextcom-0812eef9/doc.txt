African swine fever starts killing Sri Lanka’s wild boars

ECONOMYNEXT – African swine fever which devasted Sri Lanka’s pig farms especially in the Western province has now spread to the island’s wild boar population, with animals in forest reserves starting to die, a media report said.

Dead wild boars have been found in forested areas in Gampaha, Meerigma, Peradeniya and Moneragala as well as the Yala National Park, Sri Lanka’s Daily Mirror newspaper quoted Tharaka Prasad, Director, Wildlife Health at the Department of Wildlife Conservation.

“We found both swine flu and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome,” Prasad said.

“The last one is not that dangerous because its mortality rate is low. Swine fever is totally fatal for the animals of the porcine family. It is highly contagious.”

He said there was no accurate number of the dead but mortality rate was very high, posing a serious threat to the wild boar population.

The most virulent form of the disease has mortality rates as high as 100 percent.

Sri Lanka faces the risk of the entire wild boar population being wiped out, he said.

Feeding on garbage with infected meat is one of the ways the disease spreads, according to the World Health Organization.

Sri Lanka has seen an increase in the wild boar population over the past several decades and farmers now regard it as a key pest along with torque monkeys, peacocks and elephants. (Colombo/Dec27/2024)
