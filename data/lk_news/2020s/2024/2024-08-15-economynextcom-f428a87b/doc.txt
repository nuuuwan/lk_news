Sri Lanka SOE sale process was slow to avoid reversals

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s state enterprises privatization is slow due to the process that was followed to ensure that the transactions were transparent and there was no risk of being reversed, SOE restructuring unit chief Suresh Shah said.

“If it is reversed it would have damaged the investment environment in the country,” Shah told a forum organized by Advocata, a Colombo based think tank. “Particularly if the investor was a foreign investor.”

Courts reversed the privatization of Sri Lanka Insurance after a public interest petition alleged a flaw in the process.

“We were very conscious of that, and because of this we have put several controls and procedures in place to ensure the transparency, and credibility of the whole process. As a result, it has taken time.”

“You are taking these companies that are not necessarily the most efficient, not the most competitive and giving it to a new investor.”

The SOE unit began the process last year and was planning to finish them by August 2024.

The SOE unit first called public tenders to hire advisors to the sale which went through the tender committee and cabinet approval.

Requests for proposals were called by advisors after analyzing the companies. The responses were then evaluated and a pre-qualified short list was prepared.

The financial bids were then called. There was a project committee and cabinet appointed tender board involved.
