Colombo, April 14 (Daily Mirror)- A group of Sri Lankans enroute to Tel Aviv in Israel on board Fly Dubai flight FZ 1625 have been stranded in Dubai because air travel is disrupted due to tensions in the region between Iran and Israel.

Sri Lankan Ambassador in Israel Nimal Bandara told the Daily Mirror that the flight with some Sri Lankans among the passengers on board was diverted to Dubai following the information about the air strikes by Iran into Israeli territory.

He said there are flight delays in the region and requested Sri Lankans travelling to or via the region to contact their respective airlines for possible changes in flight schedules.
