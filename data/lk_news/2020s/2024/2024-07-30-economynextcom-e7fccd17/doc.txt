Sri Lanka cabinet clears more egg imports by state agency

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet has approved the import of eggs by State Trading (General) Corporation to stop spikes in egg prices, Spokesman Bandula Gunawardana said.

The import of eggs will prevent price spikes during the upcoming Ramazan and Christmas seasons, he said.

Sri Lanka has imported 224 million eggs after a cabinet decision allowed imports in March and 95 percent was sold through state-run Sathosa at 37 rupees an egg. The permission had run out in April 30.

Sri Lanka has slapped import licensing taxes on maize, pushing up feed costs, and making poultry more expensive, farmers have complained. The dairy sector also faces similar constraints.

Sri Lanka started importing eggs after the Consumer Affairs Authority imposed price controls on eggs and forced farmers to kill off flocks for meat, when feed prices went up during an economic crisis.

Nobody has been held accountable for the damage done to the poultry industry. (Colombo/July30/2024)
