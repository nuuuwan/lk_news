Imthiaz slams Govt. refusal to sign joint UN letter condemning Israel

Says letter reaffirms the crucial role of UN in mediating global conflicts and reflects growing call for justice and peace

Recalls SL’s consistent backing of Palestinian rights at the UN and says country has proud history of upholding international peace and justice

Stresses refusal to sign letter signals unfortunate shift away from such values when global instability demands SL remain committed to multilateral diplomacy

Requests SL to reconsider position and align foreign policy with efforts that uphold dialogue and fairness

Former Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Imthiaz Bakeer Markar expressed deep concern over Sri Lanka’s recent decision not to sign the joint letter issued by 105 countries condemning Israel’s ban on UN Secretary-General António Guterres from entering the country.

He said the letter reaffirms the crucial role of the UN in mediating global conflicts and providing humanitarian assistance, particularly in the ongoing Middle East crisis, and reflects the growing international call for justice and peace.

In a statement released over the weekend, Bakeer Markar emphasised Sri Lanka’s longstanding tradition of supporting multilateralism, justice, and peace at the international level, particularly in its consistent backing of Palestinian rights at the UN. He noted that Sri Lanka’s refusal to sign this joint declaration represents a stark departure from its historical diplomatic stance.

“Sri Lanka has a proud history of upholding international peace and justice, especially in conflict resolution and standing up for the oppressed,” Bakeer Markar said. “Our decision not to sign this letter signals an unfortunate shift away from those values at a time when global instability demands that we remain committed to multilateral diplomacy,” he added.

He urged the Sri Lankan Government to reconsider its position and align the country’s foreign policy with efforts that uphold dialogue, fairness, and respect for international law. “Sri Lanka cannot afford to remain silent on matters of global importance, especially when it comes to supporting institutions like the UN, which play a critical role in safeguarding peace and human rights worldwide,” Bakeer Markar noted.

The former MP’s statement also called for Sri Lanka to reassert its place on the world stage as a consistent voice for peace, justice, and multilateral cooperation.
