Chevron Lubricants Lanka PLC (CLLP) announced yesterday its intention to donate

$ 35,000 to the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society (SLRCS) as flood relief, specifically towards the cleaning of 1,500 wells in the Colombo and Matara districts, considering the devastation caused by floods during the first week of June 2024.

The project aims to directly benefit 1,500 families (approximately 7,500 individuals) in the flood-affected districts. Priority will be given to the most vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and individuals with compromised health conditions in Colombo and Matara districts.

The main objective of the well-cleaning program, after the floods in Sri Lanka, is to restore access to safe and clean drinking water for flood-affected communities, thereby preventing waterborne diseases and promoting public health.

“We are deeply saddened by the loss of lives and livelihoods caused by the floods in Sri Lanka. As a responsible corporate citizen, we are committed to supporting the relief and recovery efforts of the SLRCS, which is doing a commendable job in providing humanitarian assistance to the affected people,” said CLLP Managing Director and CEO Bertram Paul.

“We are grateful to Chevron for their generous donation and partnership in this well-cleaning program. This will enable us to reach out to more families who are in urgent need of clean water and sanitation facilities. We hope that this initiative will help them to rebuild their lives and restore their dignity,” said Sri Lanka Red Cross Society President K. Balakrishnan.

The well-cleaning program is expected to commence in July 2024 and be completed by September 2024. The SLRCS will mobilise its trained volunteers and staff to carry out the well-cleaning activities, in coordination with the relevant Government authorities and local communities. The program will also include awareness-raising sessions on hygiene and sanitation practices, as well as the distribution of hygiene kits and water purification tablets to the beneficiaries.

Chevron has been operating in Sri Lanka since 1992 and is the market leader in lubricants. CLLP is a subsidiary of Chevron Corporation, one of the world’s leading integrated energy companies. Chevron is committed to social responsibility and supports various community development projects in the areas of health, education, environment, and economic empowerment.
