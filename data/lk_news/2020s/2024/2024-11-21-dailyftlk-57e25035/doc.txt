Sri Lankan winners shine at 14th Top50 Global Awards 2024

The Top50 Professional and Career Women Global Awards 2024, organised by Women in Management (WIM), took centre stage in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on 7 November, celebrating the extraordinary achievements of women leaders from 23 countries.

This landmark event recognised the contributions of women across industries, showcasing the impact of their work on both society and the global economy.

As a Sri Lankan-born initiative, the Top50 Awards has grown into a global brand over the past 14 years, with this year’s event marking the launch of its first global edition in Malaysia. The awards drew 298 nominations from 29 countries, highlighting the widespread trust and recognition the Top50 brand enjoys.

Speaking at the event, WIM Founder and Chairperson Dr. Sulochana Segera expressed her pride in the program’s evolution: “As a Sri Lankan-born initiative, the trust placed in the Top50 brand by global professionals is truly humbling. It fills me with pride to see nominations from 29 countries and to celebrate the remarkable achievements of women leaders, including 12 exceptional Sri Lankans whose contributions to their industries and communities make our nation proud.”

The celebrations were preceded by the WIM Global Leadership Conference, held from 4-5 November in Kuala Lumpur. Attended by 175 participants from 19 countries, the conference featured 48 speakers and was graced by His Highness Tunku Zain Al-’Abidin ibni Tuanku Muhriz. The discussions emphasised collaboration, equity, and women’s leadership across borders.

Highlighting the significance of hosting the awards in Malaysia, WIM Malaysian Chapter Chairman Prof. Dr. Selvaraj Oyyan Pillay remarked: “When I witnessed the Top50 Global Awards in Sri Lanka, I knew this platform deserved to be in Malaysia—a nation that stands as an icon for Asia and has a global reach. Many questioned how a man could chair a women’s organisation, but WIM is about equity and collaboration. I am honoured to champion this inspiring brand here in Malaysia.”

The judging panel for the 2024 awards included an esteemed group of professionals from around the world. Reflecting on the judging process, Shehara De Silva, representing the panel, shared: “It was awe-inspiring to read the stories of so many impactful women beyond borders. Their contributions to society and the economy are incredible. As one of my fellow judges from Norway said during the ceremony, ‘This feels like attending an Oscars for inspiring women!’ The calibre of nominees was truly phenomenal.”

The WIM Top50 Awards started as a local initiative in Sri Lanka and has since expanded to Maldives, Canada, UAE, Africa, and the UK. With the successful launch of its Malaysian chapter, the awards continue to shine a spotlight on women breaking barriers and redefining success across the globe.

The winners of the Top50 Global Awards 2024 represent the pinnacle of professional excellence, resilience, and leadership. This event not only celebrated their individual achievements but also underscored the collective power of women to drive positive change worldwide.
