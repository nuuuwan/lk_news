Policy framework sent to Parliament for transformational change in education sector: Minister

Colombo, Feb 17 (Daily Mirror) - A policy framework has been sent to Parliament for a transformational change in the education sector in the country, which has been discussed for many years, Education Minister Susil Premajayantha said.

While attending a meeting held at the National Institute of Education to discuss the current problems and challenges in the education sector as well as future education reforms, the Minister said that actions taken for a transformational change in the education sector should be implemented step by step and there should be a strong foundation for that.

The Minister further stated that if any change is made, the structure should be prepared to withstand the change and that the necessary steps are being taken to prepare the structure correctly.

There are about 1,000 vacancies in the Education Administration Service and a large number of vacancies in the Teacher Counselling Service. Accordingly, steps have been taken to recruit 22,000 graduates for the Sri Lankan Teaching Service, but those recruitments have been stopped until the court case is over.

Moreover, the Minister pointed out that the recruitment of 13,500 teachers at the provincial level has to wait until the final supervisory decision is received, and even the Public Service Commission's decisions change from time to time, and as a result, solutions to these professional problems are further delayed.
