Sri Lanka hikes fertilizer subsidy to small paddy farmers ahead of polls

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet has approved raising a fertilizer subsidy to small paddy farmers to 25,000 rupees an acre from an earlier planned 15,000 rupees, Minister Bandula Gunawardana said.

Agricultural Minister Mahinda Amaraweera had requested that a higher amount be paid to help start the upcoming Maha (main) cultivation season, he said.

The money will be credited directly to bank accounts of farmers, he said.

The cabinet earlier this month decided to pay 15,000 rupees per acre for up to two acres for small paddy farmers for the current cultivation season. (Colombo/Aug27/2024)
