Sri Lanka’s Nation Lanka Finance delays private placement

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Nation Lanka Finance Plc said it was delaying a sale of its shares to pre-selected individuals due to various circumstances; and that the postponement was leading to an erosion of capital.

“The continuous erosion of capital resulting from the delay has required further negotiations for additional capital to meet the minimum capital requirement from a strategic investor with the concurrence the Central Bank of Sri Lanka,” the company said in a stock exchange filing.

There was no finality or certainty on the conclusion of these discussions, the finance company said.

“We are unable to make a further definitive statement in relation to the way forward with regard to the private placement of shares.”

The company said a disclosure will be made when discussions result in ‘some form of definitive arrangement’.

The company proposed it would offer a private placement last October, subject to several conditions which included the submission of audited financial statements for 2022/2023, and obtaining regulatory and shareholder approvals.

The share was trading flat at 0.40 on Monday. (Colombo/June24/2024)
