Deadline for submission of bids for SriLankan extended

The deadline for submission of bids for SriLankan Airlines has been extended by 45 days, says Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva.

A live auction was scheduled to take place today (March 05) to choose an investor for the divestment of SriLankan Airlines, as per a comment made by the lawmaker during Ada Derana’s ‘GET REAL’ segment last week.

However, convening a media briefing today, the minister revealed that bids would be called for another 45 days before choosing an investor for the national carrier.

Further, the Cabinet of Ministers has green-lighted a proposal for the government to absorb SriLankan Airlines’ outstanding debt to the tune of USD 510 million, the minister added.

In addition, the Cabinet approval has been given to allocate funds to maintain services of the national carrier for another six months.
