2023 A/L exam’s rescheduled Agri. Science test held today

Students are facing the 2023 G.C.E. Advanced Level examination’s Agricultural Science question papers I and II once again today (Feb.01) after the earlier test papers were cancelled and rescheduled.

The test held in January was annulled after it was revealed that several questions of both Paper I and II had been leaked.

On 12 January, Paper II of the Agricultural Science subject was cancelled, followed by the annulment of Paper I on January 17.

This prompted the Department of Examination to announce a fresh date for the Agricultural Science test.

Accordingly, the test was rescheduled for today, with Paper II being held from 8.30 a.m. to 11.40 a.m., and Paper I from 1 p.m. - 3 p.m.

The admission cards for school applicants for this exam were sent to the respective school principals, while admission cards for private applicants were mailed to them via post.
