HRCSL makes strong recommendations over prefectsâ€™ appointments at Royal College

The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) has issued a set of recommendations to Royal College, Colombo 7, pertaining to alleged irregularities in the appointments of the Prefects Council for the year 2023/2024.

In its recommendations, the HRCSL insists that Royal College appoint one of the complainant students, M.G. Jayawardena as a prefect as he has achieved a mark exceeding the cut-off of 27.

The Commission also recommends that the Principal of Royal College investigates a complaint filed by one of the complainants, M. Pathberiya alleging mistreatment by members of the Prefects Council.

Furthermore, the HRCSL suggests that the Royal College Principal discusses with the tutorial staff on the appointment of two prefects who do not meet the relevant criteria.

The Commission is also awaiting the outcome of an investigation by the Education Ministry into the submission of false documents by Royal College to the Commission inquiry regarding the appointment of two prefects.

The HRCSL highlights that Royal College did not conduct the relevant appointments in an effective and transparent manner, thereby violating the pertinent guidelines. Therefore, it urges Royal College to adhere to the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Education for the appointment of prefects to prevent such incidents in the future. This action follows seven complaints filed by students of Royal College, alleging rights violations in the 2023/2024 prefect appointment process.
