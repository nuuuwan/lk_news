IDB kicks off new initiative to boost exports tomorrow

Under the national program aimed at constructing an export-oriented manufacturing economy, the Industrial Development Board of Ceylon has initiated the “Arambamu Jayagamu” program to facilitate the global market entry of products.

The promotional and awareness campaign for this program in the Gampaha district is scheduled to take place at the Kurunegala Town Hall premises on Tuesday, 20 February, from 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.

IDB said all government, non-government organisations, financial institutions, and business service organisations supporting business development and exports will collectively provide information and services on that day.

Attendees will have the opportunity to gain insights into initiating a business, obtain information for business commencement, receive support for developing existing businesses, start or enhance export endeavours, and find solutions and related services for challenges encountered in business operations.

A meeting with export buyers is also planned for the program, and industrialists are urged to bring samples of the products intended for export. Additionally, a lecture series on the export process, certification, and digital marketing has been organised for the event.
