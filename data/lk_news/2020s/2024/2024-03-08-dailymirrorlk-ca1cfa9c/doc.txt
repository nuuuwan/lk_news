Vets dispute Pramitha Bandara’s stray dog population claim over data accuracy

Colombo, March 8 (Daily Mirror) - The declaration by Defense State Minister Pramitha Bandara Tennakoon in Parliament yesterday regarding the population of stray dogs in the country is baseless and it is asserted that the State Minister issued this statement without possessing accurate data on the subject, advisor to the Association of Veterinarians for Humane Management of Animal Population,  Dr. Chamith Nanayakkara said.

The State Minister said that some 6.2 million stray dogs are roaming in different parts of the country and that this situation has caused serious issues in tourist areas such as Sigiriya.

He mentioned that previously, inaccurate statements had been circulated about the monkey population in the country, citing incorrect figures and contributing to a false perception within the community that there are three million monkeys in the country.

"As veterinarians, we have been involved with this dog population for the past 24 years. There were three million dogs in the country by 2007. Later, dog population control sterilization surgery programmes were conducted by the government as well as animal welfare associations," he said.

As a result of these programms the current dog population in the country is less than 2.1 million, he said.

"But the Minister claimed that there are 6.2 million stray dogs in the country. However, there are fewer stray dogs in the country. Even though the dogs were considered stray dogs, most of them had owners though they were living freely. There are some dogs considered as community dogs that usually live near religious places of worship, three-wheeler parks and shops," Dr. Nanayakkara said.

"According to our calculations, there is 2.1 million dog populations in the country, and three percent of them can be considered stray dogs," he said.

Therefore, the State Minister has made a false statement, and it has become a threat to the lives of the existing dog population in the country, the doctor said.

"The State Minister also claimed that the huge dog population has become a situation that has caused serious issues in tourist areas such as Sigiriya. Sigiriya is a place where the dog population has been systematically controlled and vaccinated during the past six years. Without knowing anything about the dog-control programmes, it is unfit to make such statements in Parliament," Dr. Nanayakkara said.

"An amount of Rs. 200 million was allocated to control the dog population and to continue with the sterilization surgery programmes. But until now no funds have been received by the districts this year for equipment to continue with the sterilization surgery programmes," he said.

Many animal welfare organizations used to engage in sterilization surgeries on between 35,000 and 40,000 animals in the county annually. Dr. Nanayakkara claimed that certain officers attached to the Health Ministry did not even agree to join these organizations.
