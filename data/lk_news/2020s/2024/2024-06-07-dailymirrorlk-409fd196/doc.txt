Anura, Sajith debate becomes a non-event

Colombo, June 07 (Daily Mirror)- The public debate which was to be held between National Peoples Power (NPP) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake and Leader of Opposition Sajith Premadasa became a non-event last night as Premadasa did not turn up for it.

Dissanayake was present and was answering questions asked from him by the presenter who was doing the ‘ Thulawa’ talk show on ITN last night.

Commenting on the matter Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha who was coordinating affairs with regard to the debate told Daily Mirror that Premadasa never agreed for a debate which was to be aired by ITN. “We only agreed for a debate which was to be held on a public place with TV coverage,” he said.
