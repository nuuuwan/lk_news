Newcomers to SJB can be controlled through political tactics: Marikar

Colombo, March 12 (Daily Mirror) - In response to why the Samagi Jana Balwegaya (SJB) is depending on newcomers while neglecting its own members, its spokesman and Member of Parliament S.M. Marikar said the newcomers can be dealt with political tactics.

The MP was responding to a question raised by journalists at a media briefing as to why the party is depending on MPs such as Nalaka Godahewa when deciding on economic affairs.

Marikar responded to this question by recalling how President Ranasinghe Premadasa dealt with late SLMC leader A.H.M. Asroff in 1989. Asraff wanted President Premadasa not to give nominations to three UNP Muslim members in the East if he was to support the UNP in 1989. President Premadasa did not give the three UNPers nominations but appointed them to Parliament though the national list. He made one MP a member of the Cabinet and two others as State Ministers,” Marikar recalled.

“One can deal with outsiders who join a party through tactical moves the way late President Premadasa did,” he added.
