State Astrologers’ Committee refutes allegations of faulty auspicious times for New Year

Colombo, March 18 (Daily Mirror)- Refuting allegations of faulty auspicious times during the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, the State Astrologers’ Committee justified the designation of auspicious times for performing Sinhala New Year rituals at night, claiming that they wanted the most suitable time for the rituals despite practical difficulties.

Committee member astrologer G.M. Gunapala told a news conference at the Government Information Department that the sun's transit occurs at 9.05 pm on April 13 and that the New Year rituals must be designated during the auspicious time within six hours and twenty-four minutes from 9.05 pm when the sun's transit occurs.

He said the auspicious times were designated at night during the six hours and twenty-four minutes avoiding the Raahu Kalaya.

"We admit the practical issues in observing New Year rituals at night. But, the State Astrologers’ Committee wanted to designate best time for rituals more than practical difficulties in observing the rituals," he said.

Committee member Astrologer Ananda Seneviratne said auspicious times in this manner come once every four years and requested the people to follow the designated times.

Astrologer A.K.U. Sarath Chandra said the majority of the committee approved the designated times and added that only five members out of the 42 had objected and wanted the auspicious times designated during daytime.

"Four of these five members are new to the Committee. They have joined just three years ago. They also signed and approved the designated times even though they came out and objected," he said.

Some Astrologers raised objections to the auspicious times designated for performing the Sinhala New Year rituals, alleging inaccuracies in the schedule. They also took their concerns to the Anunayakas of the Malwatta and Asgiriya Chapters, seeking rectification of what they deem as flawed timings.
