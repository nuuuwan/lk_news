Jayasumana slams AKD over ‘misleading comments’ on chronic kidney disease

Prof. Channa Jayasumana says that the recent statement made by leader of the National People’s Power (NPP) Anura Kumara Dissanayake regarding the chronic kidney disease spreading associated with agricultural communities in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts is completely false.

The Parliamentarian, who was a researcher on epidemic kidney disease in agricultural communities in Sri Lanka, alleged that research has already confirmed the cause of kidney disease in these areas.

“There is nothing new to discover about this, nor any new treatment to be found. We have been conducting research on the matter for 15 years, and all the facts have been revealed”, he said.

“Two main causes have been identified for this kidney disease: one is the impact of certain types of agrochemicals, and the other is long-term dehydration.”

“The solution is to provide clean drinking water to the people in these areas. We have been supplying drinking water to these areas through water filtrations systems continuously since 2011. As a result, this agricultural kidney disease is being reduced”, Jayasumana expressed.

“This statement was made by Mr. Anura Kumara after seeing a large crowd”, he charged.

On Saturday (22), NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that the cause of the chronic kidney disease that is spreading in the agricultural communities associated with the North Central Province will be identified through research in near future under an NPP government.

He had made this remark while addressing a farmers’ rally of the National People’s Power held in Dehiattakandiya yesterday.
