Man who spoke out on visa issue at BIA summoned to record statement

Katunayake, May 06 (Daily Mirror)- The man who spoke out at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) recently against the takeover of the on-arrival visa issuance process by an Indian company has been summoned to the Katunayake Airport Police to record a statement.

The man, who identified himself as Sandaru Kumarasinghe,Â  told reporters that he had been summoned by the Airport Police to record a statement regarding the incident where he spoke out against the on-arrival visa issuance process being handed over to an Indian Company.

He said that the people must determine whether the statement should be recorded from him, who represented the people, or from those who decided to outsource the visa issuance to a foreign company.

He said people must have the right to raise their voices when national assets are sold out.

A video circulated on social media showing long queues at the airport and a Sri Lankan individual was blaming the Indian visa issuing officers, alleging that his wife's on-arrival visa was cancelled.

He shouted, questioning how an Indian person could decide his or his wife's visa status and asserting his rights as a Sri Lankan citizen. He claimed he had the right to decide his visa and emphasized his status as a taxpayer, stating he paid approximately Rs. 4 million rupees each year.

He insisted on his right to raise his voice in this matter and showed disgust as to why the Sri Lankan Government had to sell the visa-issuing system to an Indian company when several Sri Lankan companies could handle that.
