Health sector trade union action to resume; protest campaigns to be launched island-wide

The Convenor of the Health Trade Union Alliance Chanaka Dharmawickrama has revealed that the trade union action, which was launched by a collective of 72 health sector unions, will resume on 01 February.

The suspended action, which seeks ‘economic justice’ for healthcare employees will resume on 01 February, with protest campaigns planned in front of hospitals nation-wide starting January 23, Dharmawickrama said.

He further highlighted that while they are trying to minimize the burden imposed on patients as a result of their trade union action, these matters would resolve themselves if the state agreed to meet their demands, or promptly provide an alternate solution for their issues.
