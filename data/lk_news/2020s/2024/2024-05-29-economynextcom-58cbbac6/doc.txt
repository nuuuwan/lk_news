Defence Ministry clearance a must for Sri Lanka ex-servicemen applying for Russia visa

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka ex-servicemen applying for visit visas to Russia will now have to get Defence Ministry clearance, Minister of Foreign Affairs M U M Ali Sabry said.

Sabry met the Russian Ambassador in Colombo Levan S Dzhagaryan on Wednesday.

“We addressed the urgent situation of Sri Lankans being deployed in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and agreed on immediate steps to resolve these issues,” the minister said on social media platform X (twitter).

“Russia will now require Sri Lanka Defence Ministry clearance for visit visas of ex-servicemen.”

The upcoming visit to Russia will enable further discussions to find a solution to this matter, Sabry said.

A Sri Lankan delegation including State Foreign Minister Tharaka Balasuriya and Defence Secretary Kamal Gunaratne will leave to Moscow “soon” to have discussions over concerns over hundreds of the island nation’s ex-solders now joined Russia-Ukraine war, Sabry said earlier.

At least 16 Sri Lankans are reported to have been killed and around 600 likely to have joined as combatants mainly to Russian side, taking risk for higher salary.
