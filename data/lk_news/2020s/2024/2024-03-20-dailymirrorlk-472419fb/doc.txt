Diana wants swift action to stop tourists on visit visa doing business

Parliament, March 20 (Daily Mirror)- State Tourism Minister Diana Gamage today urged the Public Security Minister to take swift action to stop foreign tourists on visit visas engaging in business activities in Sri Lanka, claiming that it poses serious threats to local businessmen.

She told Parliament that the tourists on visit visas were engaged in business activities in Sri Lanka, specially in the Southern Province.

"This has created a great threat to the local people engaged in business activities especially, in the Southern Province. This matter should be addressed soon. We are not allowed to do any business or job in those countries on visit visa. We will be kicked out if we do so," she said.

The Minister said this issue should be resolved in a proper manner without creating issues with the countries concerned.

She urged Public Security Minister Tiran Alles, who is in charge of Immigration and Emigration, to look into the matter and take a decision regarding the matter as it could aggravate into a crisis in the near future.
