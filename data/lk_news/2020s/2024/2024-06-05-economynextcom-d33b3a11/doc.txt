Law students in Sri Lanka mostly female, but President’s Counsel male: Eran

ECONOMYNEXT – About 75 percent of students at the law faculty are female but there are hardly any female Presidents Counsel, opposition legislator Eran Wickremaratne said.

“Seventy five percent of students at law faculty are female but there are only two or three presidential counsel lawyers in the entire country,” Wickremaratne told parliament during the debate of the Women’s Empowerment Bill.

“So what is this problem? There seems to be an attitude problem. We have to accept this. We cannot run away from this.

“We did not choose to be a woman or man at birth. So we cannot be made to pay for things which are not of our choice.”

The Women’s Empowerment Bill was an admirable effort by the government and the Women’s Caucus in parliament he said.

The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women was adopted by the United Nations in 1979 but it has still not been made into law in Sri Lanka he said.

There were also other cultural practices which seemed to go against equal treatment of women, he said.

“When I looked student’s associations in mixed schools, I found that the President’s position was given to a boy and the position of Secretary was given to a girl. Why is that?”

There were cases where the parent’s had to make decision whether to leave the house to the male or female child or divide it.

Women were sometimes made to stay and at home and look after children and not allowed to work.

“It is good that children are looked after but we have to look at who makes the choice,” Wickramaratne said.

“These practical and cultural factors we have to look into.”

The Womens’ and Children’s Bureau was understaffed and lacked a training budget, he said.

There was no separate budget line for the Womens and children’s Buraux in police. (Colombo/June06/2024)
