President vows support for confectionery industry

Pledges Rs. 8 billion for R&D in product diversification and innovation

Ceylon chocolates should begin to be considered by the export market across the world on par with the renowned brand identities of Ceylon Tea and cinnamon, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Colombo on January 24, addressing the 30th Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Lanka Confectionery Manufacturers Association (LCMA) at Cinnamon Grand Hotel, Colombo.

Acknowledging the success of Ceylon Tea and cinnamon globally, the President asked how long locally produced chocolates would take to gain the same level of brand identity.

“Sri Lanka has the potential to become a global player in the confectionery industry it being a low-hanging fruit, therefore, I want you to expand your horizons and tap into international markets, the President told the leading Sri Lankan confectioners who were participating in the event.

“We have the knowhow and resources to position locally produced chocolates as a world-class product similar to our world renowned brands of tea and cinnamon. So the confectionary industry needs to embark on a journey towards global recognition and market presence,” he said.

Citing the success of the Kandos factory in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia in 1978, the President hailed the pioneers of the industry and urged the current players of the industry to look beyond borders and expand their footprint into new markets by exporting their products.

The President went on to pledge Rs. 8 billion for Research and Development (R&D) to foster a thriving confectionery industry with innovation and diversification to take the industry to the next level.

“We will collaborate with the governments of Ghana and Ivory Coast as well as small cocoa producers in those countries to facilitate cocoa producing in Sri Lanka,” he said.

“We are considering initiatives to lease out State-owned plantations to Sri Lankan companies for the development of the food industry including the confectionery sector,” he said.

Esteemed confectionery industry founders and manufacturers were honoured at the AGM of the LCMA; including Hinni Appuhamy, and Arthur Von. Possner, Junius Motha, Mineka Wickremesinghe, P.J.C. Perera, Sinnasamy Muttiah, Upali Wijewardene and Vidanage John Appuhami in recognition of their immense contribution to the sector.
