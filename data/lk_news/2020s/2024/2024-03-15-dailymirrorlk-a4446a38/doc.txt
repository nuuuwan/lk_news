Heat advisory issued for multiple provinces, districts

Colombo, March 15 (Daily Mirror) -Â  As temperatures soar in parts of Sri Lanka, authorities warn of an impending rise in the heat index, particularly in regions spanning the North-Eestern, North-Central and Eastern Provinces, as well as in the Colombo, Gampaha, Moneragala, Mannar, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya and Hambantota districts.

The heat index, a measure of how hot it feels to the human body when relative humidity is factored in with the actual air temperature, is anticipated to escalate to levels classified as 'Caution.'

This poses potential health risks, especially to vulnerable populations such as the elderly, children and individuals with pre-existing health conditions.

As such, people are advised to prioritize hydration and take frequent breaks in shaded areas to prevent heat-related illnesses.

People are also advised to wear lightweight, loose-fitting, and light-colored clothing to help stay cool in the sweltering conditions.

Furthermore, individuals engaging in outdoor activities are encouraged to limit strenuous exertion, seek shade whenever possible, and stay adequately hydrated.
