All South Asian countries have surpassed Sri Lanka: Imthiaz

Colombo, March 05 (Daily Mirror) - While saying that Sri Lanka is currently at an impasse, SJB MP Imthiaz BakeerÂ  Markar called upon leaders and citizens to transcend political differences and unite for the collective betterment of the island nation.

He made these sentiments in the thanksgiving address at the launch of his autobiography held at the Ananda College auditorium today (05).

The event saw the participation of a plethora of dignitaries including Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, former President Chandrika Kumaratunge, Ministers, MPs, academics and other distinguished guests.

In his address, Markar highlighted the urgent necessity to discard separatist tendencies to pave the way for a prosperous Sri Lanka.

He lamented the nation's current plight, contrasting it with the promising trajectory observed during its post-independence era when it paralleled Japan in development.

"The current state of Sri Lanka, marred by prolonged issues, is a matter of great concern as we are in dire straits. We cannot afford to pass on this turmoil to future generations," Markar stressed.

"It is incumbent upon us to work tirelessly towards creating a prosperous nation, free from the shackles of divisive agendas," he added.

He further urged leaders and citizens not to succumb to the agenda of unseen forces and emphasized the importance of collective action to propel the country to new heights.

"As responsible individuals, we must contribute to steering Sri Lanka towards a brighter future. Let us join hands and set a precedent for the generations to come," Markar concluded.
