Sri Lanka expects IMF visit in two weeks: President

ECONOMYNEXT- Sri Lanka is expecting mission from the International Monetary Fund in two weeks, President Ranil Wickremesinghe told a campaign rally.

“In two weeks when the IMF team comes, we have to say that we will implement the agreement and to give the next instalment,” President Wickremesinghe told a rally in Homagama Wednesday.

“If not, we will have to say that we will change it. Then the installment will not come. Then the rupee will fall to 500 to the dollar.

Sri Lanka’s interest rates have already started to move up amid political uncertainty. The rupee has also slightly weakened.

Currencies typically collapse when soft-pegged central banks resist market interest rate pressure and engages in reverse repo, outright purchases or overnight injections to keep short or long term rates down (prints money), or sterilizes interventions in the forex markets to enforce a policy rate.

President Wickremesinghe said earlier that Sri Lanka expected to reach an agreement with private creditors.
