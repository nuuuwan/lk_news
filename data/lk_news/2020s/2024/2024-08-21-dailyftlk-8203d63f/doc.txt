The Alliance for Sustainable Infrastructure (ASI) Sri Lanka held its inaugural Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 17 August at the Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Training and Research Institute (HARTI), Colombo.

The event was a significant milestone in Sri Lanka’s journey towards sustainable infrastructure development, bringing together key stakeholders from government, civil society, and the private sector.

The ceremonial session of the AGM commenced with the arrival of the special guest, US Embassy Economic Officer Bradley Gardner, and the keynote speaker, Emeritus Professor Chitra Weddikkara, from the University of Moratuwa. The session was highlighted by a keynote address delivered by Professor Weddikkara, who emphasised the critical role of civil society in driving the National Sustainable Infrastructure Plan (NSIP) for Sri Lanka. Her speech underscored the importance of integrating sustainability into infrastructure planning and execution to promote long-term environmental health, economic vitality, and social equity.

Professor Weddikkara’s address highlighted key objectives of the NSIP, including sustainable development, resilience to climate change, inclusive growth, and economic efficiency. She also discussed the significance of the NSIP in protecting Sri Lanka’s biodiversity, stimulating economic growth, and promoting social equity. The professor called for a collaborative approach involving government, civil society, and the private sector to ensure the successful implementation of the NSIP.

The AGM also featured addresses from ASI Convenor Samantha Abeywickrama, and COSMI – ASI Coordinating Body President Nawaz Rajabdeen who both echoed the need for sustainable infrastructure that benefits all segments of society.
