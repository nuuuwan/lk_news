SeaLead Shipping, Sri Lanka Ports Authority launch direct liner service

ECONOMYNEXT – Global shipping line SeaLead Shipping has launched a weekly direct liner service with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), which increases maritime connectivity between the Far East, India, and East Africa through its Far East India Djibouti (FID) service.

“By providing direct connections between China, India, and Djibouti, the service is set to reduce transit times and boost trade efficiency across major global trade routes, especially with the inclusion of Colombo as a key hub port,” SeaLead said in a statement outlining the advantages of the FID service.

The FID service, which commenced operations on September 5, provides weekly liner services, connecting vital ports in China, India, and Djibouti, SLPA said in a statement.

The westbound route starts in Shanghai and includes key stops at Ningbo, Nansha, Port Klang, Colombo, Nhava Sheva, and Mundra, culminating in Djibouti.

The return eastbound journey links Djibouti directly back to Shanghai, streamlining trade across these critical regions.

“This partnership with SeaLead aligns with our ongoing commitment to strengthen Colombo’s status as a premier maritime hub in the region,” SLPA Managing Director Prabath Malavige said.

“The FID service will not only enhance trade connectivity but also solidify the Port of Colombo’s strategic importance in facilitating efficient global shipping operations.” (Colombo/Oct2/2024)
