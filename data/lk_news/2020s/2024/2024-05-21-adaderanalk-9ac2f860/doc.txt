Former state minister Diana Gamage granted bail

Former State Minister Diana Gamage has been released on bail after appearing before the Colombo Magistrate’s Court over allegedly obtaining a passport by producing false information.

She was ordered released on a cash bail of Rs. 500,000 and two personal bails of Rs. 10 million each by Colombo Chief Magistrate Thilina Gamage.

The former parliamentarian had arrived at the Colombo Magistrate’s Court earlier today over accusations of obtaining a passport by submitting false information.

The Criminal Investigations Department (CID) had yesterday submitted a report to the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court, naming the former State Minister as a suspect in the case pertaining to the obtaining of a diplomatic passport after providing false information.

Accordingly, the Colombo Chief Magistrate Thilina Gamage had ordered the CID to take appropriate measures and report back to the court.
