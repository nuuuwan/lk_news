Presidential Election 2024: Over 10 million polling cards distributed

Deputy Postmaster General Rajitha Ranasinghe says that the distribution of over 10 million official polling cards for the 2024 presidential election has already been completed thus far.

He also assured that the remaining polling cards will be distributed to the voters in the coming days and the Postal Department expects to complete the distribution of official polling cards by September 14th.

If any voter has not received their official polling cards by that date, they can visit their local post office with their National Identity Card (NIC) to verify their identity and obtain their polling card, Ranasinghe said.

He stated that this opportunity will be available for the voters until the date of the presidential election, which will be held on September 21.

According to the Election Commission, there are 17.44 million registered voters for the upcoming election.
