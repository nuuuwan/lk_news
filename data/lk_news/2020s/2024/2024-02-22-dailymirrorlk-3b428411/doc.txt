Bus topples in Nanu Oya injuring eight

Nanu Oya, Feb 22 (Daily Mirror) - At least eight persons were injured after a bus carrying pilgrims to Sri Pada toppled at around 7.30 p.m. today at Nanu Oya on the Nuwara Eliya-Hatton Road, the Nanu Oya police said.

They said the injured were admitted to the Nuwara Eliya base hospital.

The accident happened when the bus was driving on a section of the road with a steep slope where vehicles were not allowed to enter.

The bus had arrived from Matara, carrying 34 pilgrims to Sri Pada.

The bus had tipped over since the driver could not control it. The Nanu Oya Police said it was fortunate that a serious accident was avoided because the bus had almost gone off the road but had not gone down the precipice.
