US expresses concerns over Sri Lanka’s Online Safety Bill, calls for transparency

The United States remains concerned about the potential impact of Sri Lanka’s newly passed Online Safety Bill, Ambassador Julie Chung said on Thursday (Jan.25).

Taking to X (formerly Twitter), the US envoy in Colombo expressed dismay at passing the legislation in the parliament by majority vote without incorporating important input from key stakeholders, including civil society and tech companies.

The new law has come under fire for the problematic aspects of several clauses of the Bill, which threaten the freedom of expression, innovation and privacy.

Chung emphasized that the ‘vague and overly restrictive’ Online Safety Bill can hinder investment and development of a digital economy, undermining Sri Lanka’s much-needed economic growth.

On that account, the United States has urged the Sri Lankan authorities to prioritize transparency and ensure any legislation does not stifle the voices of its people.

In her post on X, the US ambassador said: “The United States remains concerned about the potential impact of Sri Lanka’s Online Safety Bill, which passed yesterday without incorporating important input from key stakeholders, including civil society and tech companies who say that this legislation threatens freedom of expression, innovation, and privacy.

“In addition to jeopardizing democratic values, vague and overly restrictive legislation can hinder investment and the development of a digital economy, undermining the economic growth that Sri Lanka needs. The U.S. urges Sri Lanka to prioritize transparency and ensure any legislation does not stifle the voices of its people.”
