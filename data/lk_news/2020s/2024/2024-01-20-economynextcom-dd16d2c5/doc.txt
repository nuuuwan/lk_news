Sri Lanka, Nepal discuss MP exchange programme

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Prime Minister of Nepal Pushpa Kamal Dahal met on Saturday (20) in Kampala, Uganda, on the sidelines of the Non-Aligned Movement Summit.

The two leaders discussed promoting bilateral tourism and developing cultural and religious ties that have existed between the two countries historically.

“With the aim of expanding political relations, a proposal was made to facilitate an exchange program for Members of Parliament to study the parliamentary affairs of both countries,” a statement by Wickremesinghe’s media division said.

Late last year, Wickremesinghe told a group of school children that Parliament had become a place where a lot of MPs act. He said some MPs don’t know where to draw the line when acting in Parliament. (Colombo/Jan20/2024)
