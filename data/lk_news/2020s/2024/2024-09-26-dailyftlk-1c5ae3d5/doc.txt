President orders investigation into misuse of 253 Presidential Secretariat vehicles

National People’s Power (NPP) member Wasantha Samarasinghe yesterday disclosed that President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has ordered a thorough investigation into the misuse of 253 vehicles belonging to the Presidential Secretariat, which have now been left parked at Galle Face Green by various individuals without formal acknowledgement.

“The President has already directed officials to investigate the individuals who used these 253 vehicles and hold them accountable for leaving the vehicles unattained and irresponsibly after misusing the State property,” he told journalists near Galle Face Green yesterday.

Samarasinghe highlighted that this situation is a clear example of the misuse of State power and public resources by the previous regime.

“Such instances of misuse are a result of individuals taking advantage of properties that were never formally assigned to them,” he said, adding that those found guilty will be made public.

“The officials of the Presidential Secretariat have a duty to identify the culprits and bring them to justice. These are public properties and we are committed to returning them to the public,” Samarasinghe said.
