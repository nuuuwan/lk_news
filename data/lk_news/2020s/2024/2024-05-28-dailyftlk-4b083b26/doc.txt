Bringing vision to life: Implementing ‘Creative Sri Lanka 2030’ project

Exchanging the MoU and making a commitment to initiative discussed

EDB collaborates with Institute for Future Creations to launch ‘Creative Sri Lanka 2030’

The Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB), in collaboration with the Institute for Future Creations (TIFC) and other relevant stakeholders, including the London College of Fashion (UAL) and the Chamber of Ethical Lifestyle Enterprises (CELE), recently launched the ‘Creative Sri Lanka 2030’ project during a ceremony held at the EDB head office.

The event brought together key stakeholders from the Government, private sector and civil society to celebrate the beginning of the program and strategize its successful execution.

The objectives of this collaborative effort are promoting ethical, sustainable manufacturing and increasing the export of value-added, niche products, enabling the industry to make a maximum contribution to economic development. The global creative industry stands out as one of the fastest-growing economic sectors worldwide, with high engagement of SME entrepreneurs, duly acknowledged for its importance and substantial role as a contributor to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in numerous countries.

The event was attended by the presence of officials including EDB Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Kingsley Bernard, Investment Promotion Ministry Additional Secretary Anoja Herath, London College of Fashion Knowledge Exchange Lead Hannah Middleton, Institute for Future Creations Co-Founder and Partner Robert Meeder and Institute for Future Creations Co-Founder and Partner Sindu Holla.

The Sri Lankan creative industry also has significant potential to contribute to the economy, given Sri Lanka’s inherent craftsmanship, cultural diversity and rich natural resources. These provide the base for a wide range of creative industries such as art, crafts, design, fashion, filming, performing arts, heritage, architecture, Sri Lanka’s cuisines and more.

To realise this potential, Sri Lanka must continuously seek new and sustainable sources of growth. This is essential to revitalise our economy and create new job opportunities that align with the aspirations of our young people. TIFC and UAL have conducted research on ‘Sri Lanka’s Crafting Potential: Sustainable Trade and Development for Sri Lanka’s artisanal sector’ to gain an in-depth understanding of the Sri Lankan craft sector for future interventions, with the three key pillars —innovation, collaboration, and education—in mind, and a research report has been prepared.

As part of this ground-breaking initiative, the EDB, in collaboration with TIFC and UAL, will be selecting ten pioneering Sri Lankan brands. These brands are set to showcase the nation’s dedication to sustainability, ethical practices, and cultural heritage on a global scale, with support from CELE and Good Life X. Chosen for their commitment to ethical standards, sustainability, and social responsibility, these ten brands will undergo a comprehensive capacity-building program.

Further Creative Industry will be showcased at the Textile and Apparel fashion exhibition in London, backed by the Sri Lanka Apparel Sourcing Association (SLASA), Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF), and the Sri Lanka High Commission - UK.

The ‘Creative Sri Lanka 2030’ program not only seeks to promote Sri Lankan crafts internationally but also aims to make a significant impact on the local economy by fostering a sustainable business model that benefits artisans and their communities.

Creative Sri Lanka 2030 marks a visionary stride towards integrating Sri Lankan heritage into global markets, ensuring that the nation’s cultural exports remain competitive and culturally enriching. Through the support of these ten brands, Sri Lanka not only showcases its unique artistic talents but also sets a global standard for ethical and sustainable business practices.

As the apex organisation for the development and promotion of exports, the EDB is constantly seeking innovative approaches to meet the ever-changing needs of the international market. Therefore, it will provide full cooperation in developing and promoting this sector and providing opportunities to promote your products and services internationally.
