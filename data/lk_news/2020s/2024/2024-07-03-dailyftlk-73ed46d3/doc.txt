Next SL leader needs economic vision, not just debt management skills: Prof Charitha Herath

Freedom People’s Congress (FPC) member Prof. Charitha Herath has called for Sri Lanka to appoint a leader capable of managing the country’s economy, not merely its debt. Speaking at a press conference yesterday, Herath addressed the current economic situation and the forthcoming political changes.

Herath highlighted that the broad economic crisis has now evolved into a debt crisis. He criticised the prevailing focus on debt management, which he believes has led to a misconception that the ideal Presidential candidate is one who excels in debt management.

“This is wrong. No matter who is appointed, he must manage debt, but the reason for choosing a new President should not be his ability to manage debt. It should be someone with a broad vision to manage the economy,” Herath asserted.

He warned that economic management has been overshadowed by an excessive focus on debt management.

Herath also noted that July will be a pivotal month for Sri Lankan politics as from 17 July onwards, the Election Commission will be constitutionally empowered to call for a Presidential election. He declared that the President’s “Caucasian Chalk Circle” would end in another 100 days, leading to significant political change.

“In 100 days, a new President will be appointed. In other words, the Caucasian Chalk Circle being staged by the President will end in 100 days, and there will be political change,” Herath stated.

He referenced the President’s Parliamentary address yesterday, where the President described the new political situation in the country as “disaster IMF-ism.” Herath pointed out: “the main word in Sri Lankan politics today is IMF.”
