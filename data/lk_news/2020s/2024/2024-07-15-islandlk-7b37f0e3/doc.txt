Occidental Eden Beruwala’s Sippi: Serving up gastronomy with a slice of paradise

Set against the backdrop of the sun-kissed southern shores of Sri Lanka and vast expanse of turquoise ocean, Occidental Eden Beruwala recently launched its latest culinary innovation ‘Sippi,’ a refined A la carte restaurant. Deriving inspiration from the Sinhala words ‘sippi katu,’ meaning seashells, ‘Sippi’ combines the synergy of the sea with local gastronomic delights paired with the epitome of refined luxury.

The evening unfolded with tantalising offerings, where fragrant island spices mingled with hand-crafted premium cocktails and wines, accompanied by the lilting melody of jazz tunes under open skies. The unveiling of ‘Sippi’ was attended by an exclusive group of in-house guests, special invitees, well-wishers and staff from Occidental Eden. Every visitor had the choice of choosing a dish from the extensive menu, inviting each one to partake in a truly bespoke culinary journey.

While dining at ‘Sippi,’ guests are offered a choice of both outdoor or indoor options with all-encompassing views of Occidental Eden’s infinity pool and the shimmering sea, while choosing from an authentic collection of local specialities and international favourites. A modern take on dining culture, rooted in experimental dishes with a global flair and bursts of island flavour, patrons are invited to explore Sri Lanka through a variety of inspiring cuisines.

Shohan Chandiram, Director Sales & Marketing – Browns Hotels & Resorts, shared his vision of enhancing local food and beverage offerings for leisure travellers. He underscored the significance of highlighting ‘Sippi’ as the go-to choice for artfully curated dishes paired with a thematic ambience, reminiscent of Occidental Eden’s beachfront ethos.

Channa Ekanayake, General Manager of Occidental Eden Beruwala, noted that designed to be delicious and sustainable at the same time, the hotel takes a conscious approach by sourcing home-grown ingredients and working with local suppliers in the neighbouring areas.

Mastering regional flavours, while blending Sri Lankan tradition with Western techniques is the thinking behind Sippi’s Corporate Chef, Deepal De Alwis’ thought process. He described the dining space as a way for guests to travel through time with the power of taste and be inspired by a fusion of A la cart dishes curated to discover and inspire.
