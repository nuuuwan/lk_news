Court refuses injunction against Gazette on plantation workersâ€™ minimum wage

The Court of Appeal has refused to grant an interim injunction preventing the implementation of the gazette notification issued by the Minister of Labour, which stipulates a minimum daily wage for plantation workers.

This order was issued when a petition filed by plantation companies seeking a writ order invalidating the relevant gazette notification was taken up for consideration today (03).

However, the judge bench, which fixed the petition for hearing, ordered that notice be issued to Minister of Labor Manusha Nanayakkara and other respondents of the petition, notifying them to appear before the court on June 26.
