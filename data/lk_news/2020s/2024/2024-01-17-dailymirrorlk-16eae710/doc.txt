Sri Lanka under pressure in must-win game

Colombo, Jan. 17 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka will be under pressure when they take on the underdogs Zimbabwe in the third and deciding Twenty20 International at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo tomorrow.

The series is locked 1-1 after the visitors pulled off a last-over win in the second T20I on Tuesday at the same venue.

Sri Lanka will have to produce an improved batting performance as their top order struggled in the previous match before the experienced Angelo Mathews and Charith Asalanka came to their rescue.

Despite finishing with a challenging score of 173 they failed to keep up the momentum as Craig Ervineâ€™s top knock of 70 laid the foundation for a thrilling win.

Sri Lanka cannot afford to make the same mistakes and will be hoping that the top order comprising Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Mendis, Kusal Janith and Sadeera Samarawickrema will strike form.

The bowling is also much left to be desired as Skipper Wanindu Hasaranga was forced to utilise as many as seven bowlers to curtail the Zimbabwe batsmen.

Zimbabwe on the other hand can be satisfied with their performances and their sheer commitment was visible in the dying stages of the second T20 encounter.

They showed that they had the ammunition to swing the tide in their favour and when the sixth wicket fell they were left with the daunting task of making a further 34 runs from 14 balls and they did it in style.

The players to take note will be Ryan Burl, Luke Jongwe and Clive Madande who could put in another repeat of the previous encounter.

However, with the two teams in a must-win situation, another close contest is on the cards.
