Riyadh-bound Sri Lankan Airline returns after mid-air technical issue

ECONOMYNEXT – A Riyadh-bound Sri Lankan Airlines flight returned to Colombo after it encountered a technical issue after taking off, the state-owned carrier said.

“SriLankan Airlines confirms that Flight UL 265 from Colombo to Riyadh safely returned to Colombo as a precautionary measure after encountering a technical issue mid-flight,” the SriLankan Airlines said in a statement.

“The aircraft landed without incident at approximately 19:00 hrs Sri Lanka time this evening (10 October 2024). All passengers have been provided with hotel accommodation and rebooked for the next available flight.”

SriLankan Airlines’ restructuring process has been stopped after it failed to find an appropriate investor despite a tender process.

The Airline, which once was profitable under Dubai-based Emirates management, has witnessed a raft of technical issues in Colombo as well as foreign airports recently. (Colombo/October 10/2024)
