Uswatte Confectionery Works Pvt Ltd, Sri Lanka’s oldest confectionery manufacturer, has relaunched its potato chip brand, Chirpy Chips, after a hiatus since 1994. The chips, which are made from pure potato, are available in three flavors—Cheese & Onion, Salted, and Hot N Spicy—and come in sizes of 16g, 24g, 50g, and 73g.

The relaunch is led by Managing Director Shanura Perera, aiming to make Chirpy Chips a leading snack choice in Sri Lanka. The chips will be available at local grocery stores and leading supermarkets.
