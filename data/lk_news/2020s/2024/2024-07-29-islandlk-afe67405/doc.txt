Buddhism, AI and cremation of Covid dead grab attention

MPs are not strictly divided along party lines in the current parliament, except for the TNA and JVP/NPP. MPs from other parties sit on both the government and opposition sides of the House. This movement is frequently and expected to continue in the coming weeks as political maneuvering continues. However, MPs come together for moments of shared amusement, as seen last Wednesday in the lobbies during an adjournment debate on promoting Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Here, Colombo District MP Rear Admiral (Retd) Sarath Weerasekara, who is also known for his part in the films “Gamini” (2011) and “Deveni Yuddhaya” (2023), made a comment that drew laughter from both government and opposition MPs. He said that the Buddha had used AI many times. He claimed that while AI was discovered by modern Western scientists, the Buddha through meditation and spiritual attainment achieved as much.

Both government and opposition MPs made various remarks when Weerasekara began discussing the virtues of the Karaniya Metta Sutta. He expressed concern that some unscrupulous individuals have distorted the Sutta using AI, leading to a new version circulating on social media. He urged that legal action should be taken against those who have altered the original text of the Sutta. He even called for capital punishment for those who misuse AI to undermine Buddhism.

These remarks in the chamber elicited laughter in the lobbies as fellow MPs questioned whether Weerasekera had read all the books he was citing. One MP joked that Weerasekara must have been so overwhelmed by metta that it led him to help transport the underwear and other clothes of film actress/model Piyumi Hansamali when she was placed in COVID quarantine in 2021. This, despite complaints that he was misusing his powers as the then minister in charge of police to help render personal services.

Fellow MPs laughingly suggested in lobbies that it was a mistake for Gotabaya Rajapaksa to appoint Weerasekara as the Minister in charge of the police. Instead, they argued, he should have been appointed Minister of Buddhasasana, and joked that it might have prevented the Hansamali issue.

COVID-19 also became a topic of debate earlier that day when opposition MPs and SJB leader Sajith Premadasa demanded that the government compensate the families of Muslims who were cremated during the pandemic. Muslim MPs also called for penal action against those responsible for ordering the forced cremation of Muslims who died of COVID. They called for accountability and penal action against those responsible for this decision disregarding WHO guidelines and expert opinion. Welcoming the Cabinet decision to apologize for ordering the cremation of COVID dead, he said an apology alone was insufficient.

SLMC leader Rauff Hakim noted that such compulsory cremation despite objections from families led to much unhappiness. “The previous government ignored numerous calls and compelled cremation of the COVID dead. We have been requesting the government, particularly the Health Ministry, to provide the names and details of those who were cremated. The Health Ministry claims it does not have this information. Now the government is offering an apology after all this. Is an apology enough?” Hakim questioned. MPs ALM Athaullah, SM Marikkar, and Mujibur Rahuman also called for action against those responsible.

Rahuman declared: “This was done forcibly, so those who ordered the use of force should be held accountable. This action was against WHO guidelines. Following our protests, Gotabaya Rajapaksa appointed the Dr. Channa Perera Committee, which merely served to acknowledge the government’s high-handedness. When we continued to protest, another committee under Prof. Jennifer Perera was formed.

This committee stated that burying COVID victims would not spread the virus. The government sat on this report for six months while continuing the cremations. There were then calls from Islamic countries to halt the practice. During his visit, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan urged Gotabaya Rajapaksa to stop it.

Minister Ali Sabry promised to end the forced cremations. The decision to compel cremations was political, not based on scientific evidence. We demand action against those who made and implemented this decision despite opposition,” Rahuman said.

Marikkar noted that the opposition was not allowed to speak against the forced cremations in Parliament by Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena. “Now there is an apology. The ministers who presented the cabinet paper for this apology were also part of Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s cabinet when the decision to cremate the COVID dead was made. We demand action against everyone involved in this decision,” he said.

Leader of the House and Education Minister Susil Premajayantha noted that some cabinet members who participated in the decision to cremate the COVID dead are now in the opposition. He agreed that Marikkar and others have the right to question how the decision was made and implemented. “I will bring this request for reparation and accountability to the Cabinet and promise to inform the House of the Cabinet’s response,” he said.

SJB MP Dr. Harsha de Silva emphasized the urgent need for reconciliation, which involves four elements: truth, accountability, reparation, and ensuring that the conflict does not recur. “The first element, truth, has been addressed because the government has acknowledged the issue.

The remaining phases of the reconciliation process should follow. We need to uncover the truth behind the wrong decision to identify those responsible and determine accountability. Reconciliation can only be achieved if these steps are taken,” he said.

During the week Parliament passed the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill with amendments and Regulations under the Judicature Act published under the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2360/22 and 2371/13 without a vote on Tuesday (23). Similarly, Public Financial Management and Economic Transformation Bills passed on Thursday (25) with amendments and without a vote. Friday was allotted for Condolence Votes on former MPs AHM Alavi Moualna, MN Abdul Majeed, Palitha Thevarapperuma and Milroy Fernando. Parliament is scheduled to meet again on Aug 6.
