Sri Lanka’s Opposition like village gamblers who want funeral to go on: Min

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Opposition was like informal gambling den operators at village funerals, who want the funeral to continue so they can earn on gambling (bu-ru-wa), the State Minister of Finance said.

“In our villages when there is a funeral, there is a group that comes, cries and talks a bit and then get to their main business; which is running a gambling game (su-du-wa) on the side,” Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said in Parliament on Wednesday.

“They like it if the funeral goes on for many days because they can earn on the side. I’m asking our opposition to not be like that,” Siyambalapitiya said, “Don’t cry crocodile tears.”

In reply to the accusation Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa merely asked: “So who created the funeral house?”
