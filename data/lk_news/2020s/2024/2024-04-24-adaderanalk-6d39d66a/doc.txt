Heavy traffic in Colombo due to temporary road closure

Heavy traffic is reported in parts of Colombo as multiple roads remain closed due to the arrival of Iranian President Dr. Ebrahim Raisi.

Security was beefed up in Sri Lanka for the arrival of the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, with multiple roads including the Galle Road, Colombo-Katunayake expressway, and the main road from Mattala to Uma Oya being off-limits for traffic.

Vehicular movement around Colombo – Orugodawatta, Dematagoda, Borella, D.S. Senanayake Mawatha, Horton Place, Green Path, Ananda Coomaraswamy Mawatha, Liberty Junction, St. Anthony’s Road, Galle Road, Galle Face, and Lotus Road – was restricted this evening, causing traffic congestion amidst the downpours.

Earlier this evening, the Iranian leader was ceremonially welcomed by his Sri Lankan counterpart along with a guard of honour and other pageantry at Galle Face Green.

Subsequently, the two leaders held one-on-one discussions, followed by a bilateral meeting between representatives of both nations at the Presidential Secretariat.

Dr. Ebrahim Raisi arrived in Sri Lanka this morning (24) via Mattala International Airport at a special invitation extended by President Wickremasinghe, marking the first visit of an Iranian President to Sri Lanka since former President Dr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s visit in April 2008.

During his one-day official visit, President Raisi participated in a public ceremony to inaugurate the USD 514-million Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project (UOMDP).
