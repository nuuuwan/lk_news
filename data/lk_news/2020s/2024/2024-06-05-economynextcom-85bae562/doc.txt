Sri Lanka’s COPF ends probe into controversial IVS-VFS Global visa deal

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka parliament’s Committee on Public Finance has concluded its examination of a visa deal with IVS-GBS-VFS Global, a private company, its chairman Harsha de Silva said.

Officials of the Public Security Ministry who had not come to an earlier meeting was present on June 04, he said.

“IVS-GBS VFS visa matter was concluded,” de Silva said in an x.com message. “Our report will be presented at the earliest. As I have maintained throughout, I shall not discuss substantive issues until then.

The VFS Deal led to hikes if visa fees and additional charges, including undisclosed fees being charged from tourists.

The website is also complex and puts off some visitors, compared to the user-friendly website operated by the Department of Immigration earlier, the tourist industry has said.

Following protests by Tourism Minister Harin Fernando, a 50 dollar visa has been re-introduced. (Colombo/June05/2024)
