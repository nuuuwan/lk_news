Rajitha claims Sajith-Namal have made an alliance to be President and Opposition leader

Alleges Sajith has given his word to safeguard the Rajapaksas

Says regardless of any alliances, President Wickremesinghe is confident of securing victory

Kalutara District MP Dr. Rajitha Senaratne recently made a statement regarding a perceived alliance between Namal and Sajith.

According to Senaratne, Sajith Premadasa has allegedly assured Namal Rajapaksa the position of Opposition leader in exchange for support in the Presidential election. These claims were addressed during a press conference at President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s political office in Flower Road, Colombo.

Senaratne emphasised that despite any efforts to undermine President Wickremesinghe’s victory in the upcoming election, the President remains a formidable contender.

“It seems that many people believe that the main competition in the upcoming Presidential election is between the Janata Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and President Ranil Wickremesinghe. However, it should be noted that the JVP is currently in third place with the fewest number of votes. The JVP doesn’t have much influence in the villages, so it’s important to acknowledge the actual situation on the ground.

Even though SJB is in second place, it’s still in a relatively weak position. There’s a different narrative circulating on social media today, claiming that the JVP is like a bubble – It may seem inflated, but it’s just full of hot air, essentially an illusion. This illusion will likely dissipate by the morning of 22 September.

Some individuals accuse President Ranil Wickremesinghe of supporting the Rajapaksa family despite his efforts to build the country’s economy. There were even rumours at the time about “Ranil Rajapaksa.” If President Ranil Wickremesinghe had indeed shielded the Rajapaksas, would they be opposing the President now? It’s a fact that the Rajapaksas have joined forces with Sajith, forming an unlikely alliance. That’s the reality of the situation.

Some people have accused President Ranil Wickremesinghe of favouring the Rajapaksa family despite his contributions to the country’s economy. It has been suggested that Ranil has protected the Rajapaksas, raising questions about their current actions against the President.

The alliance between the Rajapaksas and Sajith is seen as opportunistic and aimed at securing Sajith’s victory in the presidential election, with the intention of appointing Namal as the opposition leader. Allegations have surfaced that Sajith has guaranteed no repercussions for the Rajapaksas in exchange for their support, leading to accusations of deception and dishonesty.

Recently, there have been discussions between Mahinda Rajapaksa, Namal Rajapaksa, and Sajith. It is reported that Sajith has pledged his support to help Namal become the Opposition leader with the ultimate goal of positioning him as the Opposition candidate in the next Presidential election within the next five years. The Rajapaksas are currently focused on opposing President Ranil Wickremesinghe and are striving to ensure Sajith’s victory in the Presidential election, as part of their political strategy.”
