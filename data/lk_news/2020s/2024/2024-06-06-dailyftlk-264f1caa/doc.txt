The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved to direct the Legal Draftsman to draft the Bill to revise the Value Added Tax Act No. 14 of 2002 including amendments recognised as per the recommendations furnished by the temporary VAT committee appointed.

This includes the revisions acknowledged in accordance with the recommendations made by the temporary VAT committee, which was appointed in accordance with the directives of the joint committee chaired by the Government accounting committee.
