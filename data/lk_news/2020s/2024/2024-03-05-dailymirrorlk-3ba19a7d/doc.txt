Sri Lanka aim for T20I series win over Bangladesh

Colombo, Mar. 5 (Daily Mirror) - After a splendid batting performance from Sri Lanka's top order, they will aim for a Twenty20 International (T20I) Series win against Bangladesh when the two teams clash in the second match at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium tomorrow.

Sri Lanka are likely to replace young fast bowler Matheesha Pathirana for the second T20I with either Dilshan Madushanka or Nuwan Thushara.

Pathirana showed signs of injury concern during the first T20I, bowling nine wides and three no-balls in a lengthy spell.

Despite Pathirana struggling, Sri Lanka's top and middle order performed well, with stand-in Captain Charith Asalanka providing a strong finish after impressive knocks from opener Kusal Mendis and middle-order batter Sadeera Samarawickrama.

Apart from Pathirana's struggle, Sri Lanka's overall performance was excellent and changes are unlikely, the Daily Mirror learns.

Meanwhile, after having suffered a close defeat in the first match, Bangladesh are determined to bounce back in the second match.

Captain Najmul Shanto said he remains optimistic, highlighting the positives from the previous game.
