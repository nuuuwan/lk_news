According to this tariff revision which will be effective from midnight today, tariffs have been reduced by 25 percent for consumers who consume less than 30 units of electricity in the domestic sector. The unit price they pay has been reduced from Rs 8 to Rs 6.

Meanwhile, the bills of electricity consumers with monthly consumption between 61 and 90 units will be reduced by 55 percent, and the unit price for that category has been reduced from 20 to 9 rupees.

The PUCSL has also decided to reduce the tariffs by over 30 percent for religious places, Prof.  Fernando added.

Furthermore, the PUCSL Chairman said that one of the main concerns that came from the stakeholders was regarding a reduction for minor industries and hotels.

“Therefore, we have approved a 33% reduction for the hotels and minor industries during daytime. It applies for both low voltage and 33kV systems”, he added.
