Parate execution law suspended to help one party: Mayantha

Colombo, March 1 (Daily Mirror) - The government has suspended the parate execution law to help a single party which has not been able to settle its debts, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Mayantha Dissanayake alleged.

MP Dissanayake told a media briefing that his party will reveal all the details on this move in Parliament soon.

Asked whether Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa did not lobby for the suspension  of the parate execution laws, the MP said Premadasa only requested to do it in a fair and transparent manner.

“No one requested the government to do it for the benefit of one party,” he said.
