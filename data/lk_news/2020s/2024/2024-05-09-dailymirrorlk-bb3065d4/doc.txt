37 liquor permits issued this year, 474 more can be given: Siyambalapitiya

Parliament, May 09 (Daily Mirror)- A total of 37 new liquor permits (FL4) were issued by the Excise Department during the first four months of this year, State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said today.

He told Parliament that 16 out of the 37 were issued to super markets.

Responding to a question by MP Jayantha Samaraweera, the Minister said 214 liquor permits were issued in 2023 and 147 out of that were given to the tourism sector and added that according to the population ratio, 474 more liquor permits can be issued.

"The number of FL4 liquor permits are decided according to the population. There should be some 1,578 liquor permits (FL4) in the country by 2024. So, 474 more permits can be given," he said.

MP Jayantha Samaraweera said there was a public outcry that liquor permits have been given to MPs including some opposition MPs, and urged the Minister to reveal the MPs who have obtained the permits.

He said it was reported that the Excise Department had issued 1,008 applications for liquor permits and that a permit is being sold for Rs. 30 million in the market.

"Permits issued to MPs are reportedly given to super markets. Steps must be taken to stop that to ensure that the government received the revenue," the MP said.

The Minister said liquor consumption in the country had reduced by 19 percent in 2023 when compared to 2022.
