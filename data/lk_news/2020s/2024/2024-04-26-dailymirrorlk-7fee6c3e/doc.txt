Sajith wants probe into distribution of low quality rice among people

Parliament, April 26 (Daily Mirror)- Claiming that poor quality rice is being distributed among people in some areas under the government's programme to distribute free rice for April and May, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa today urged the government to launch an investigation into this incident.

The Opposition Leader told Parliament that he appreciates the government's move to distribute rice free of charge among the low income families and said it is important to ensure that high quality rice is distributed.

He said Rajitha Keerthi Tennakoon who is employed at the Presidential Secretariat has revealed in his Facebook account with photos that rice distributed in Hali Ela is of low quality.

The MP requested the government to look into the matter and take steps to distribute high quality rice as this rice is for human consumption.

He also said there were issues in selecting people for this programme.
