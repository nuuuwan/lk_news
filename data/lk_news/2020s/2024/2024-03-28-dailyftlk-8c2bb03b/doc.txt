Daughter of former Health Minister files HRCSL complaint over arrest

Former Minister of Health Keheliya Rambuwella’s daughter Chamithri Rambukwella filed a complaint with the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) yesterday, alleging that her father’s fundamental rights were violated due to his recent arrest.

Rambukwella was arrested on 2 February over his alleged involvement in the importation of substandard human immunoglobulin IV vials to Sri Lanka.

Addressing the media outside the HRCSL, Chamithri Rambukwella stated that the petition is being filed based on the legal principle of presumption of innocence. She said according to this principle, any individual accused of a crime is considered innocent until proven guilty. However, she noted that this has not been the case for her father.

She remarked that typically, suspects are arrested only after investigations are concluded. “However, my father was arrested before the completion of an investigation, and the investigation is ongoing while he remains in remand custody,” she emphasised.

Expressing her hope for the HRCSL to thoroughly examine her complaint and administer justice, she conveyed her expectation for fair treatment in her father’s case.
