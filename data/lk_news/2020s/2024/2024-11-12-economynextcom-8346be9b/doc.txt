Fonterra says gets meaningful buyer interest for Sri Lanka unit, consumer division

ECONOMYNEXT – New Zealand-based Fonterra said it has received meaningful buyer interest in initial exploration to sell off its global consumer division and integrated units in Sri Lanka and Oceania.

Earlier this year Fonterra said that it was planning to exit consumer (retail) business and focus on ingredients and food service distribution channels.

“We have received meaningful buyer interest in the businesses in scope for divestment, which is testament to their strength and potential,” Chief Executive Miles Hurrell said in a statement.

“Through the scoping phase, we have assessed both a trade sale and IPO as attractive divestment options and will now prepare for a sale process which will pursue both options.”

“We will thoroughly test the terms and value of both a trade sale and IPO with the market before seeking support from farmer shareholders for a divestment option through a vote,” Hurrell said.

“A final decision on which divestment pathway to pursue will be based on several factors, including which option will result in optimal long-term value for the Co-op.”
