Three intervening petitions filed against FR seeking to delay presidential poll

Three petitions for intervention have been filed with regard to the Fundamental Rights (FR) petition recently filed by businessman C.D. Lenawa seeking to delay the announcement of the presidential election, until the Supreme Court delivers its interpretation on the date of the Presidential poll.

The petitions for intervention were filed by the National People’s Power (NPP), Wasantha Mudalige of the Inter-University Students’ Federation (IUSF) and the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), Ada Derana reporter said.

The NPP Parliamentarian Vijitha Herath, who is one of the petitioners, has sought a court order to dismiss the relevant petition without taking up for consideration.

A five-judge bench of the Supreme Court, headed by the Chief Justice, is set to hear the FR petition filed by businessman C.D. Lenawa, seeking to delay the announcement of the presidential election, on Monday (08).

The petition has requested that an interim order be issued to prevent the calling of the presidential election within the currently scheduled period, until the Supreme Court provides its interpretation on the date of the poll.
