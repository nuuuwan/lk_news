Police chief gives undertaking to Supreme Court

Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon on Friday (05) gave an undertaking to the Supreme Court pertaining to the transfer of five Officers-in-Charge (OICs).

The officers in question, filing a motion before the country’s apex court, had alleged that the transfers given to them after the houses of a number of politicians were torched during the widespread civil unrest in May 2022, were not based on their seniority.

Accordingly, a three-member judge bench led by Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya, on Thursday (04) issued summons directing IGP Tennakoon to appear before the court to present oral submissions regarding the matter. Complying with the order, the police chief arrived at the Supreme Court complex on Friday morning.

During today’s court proceedings, IGP Tennakoon, through Additional Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne, communicated to the judge bench that the five OICs would be assigned to police stations that are commensurate with their previous assignments.
