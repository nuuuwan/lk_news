State Minister defends pre-poll subsidies as election watchdog voices concern

The People’s Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) has expressed concerns over the government’s decisions to provide subsidies for the general public following the announcement of the presidential election.

Executive Director of PAFFREL Rohana Hettiarachchi stated that such actions are “unacceptable” during the pre-election period, and that the Election Commission has been formally notified of the issue.

In response, Minister of State for Finance, Ranjith Siambalapitiya, clarified that the concessions are not intended to secure votes. He emphasized that the subsidies were introduced to address economic challenges faced by the public.

However, Hettiarachchi pointed out that, if essential, such measures should be implemented after the election to ensure fairness in the electoral process.
