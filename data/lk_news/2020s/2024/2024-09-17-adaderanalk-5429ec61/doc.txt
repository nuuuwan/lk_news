Several spells of showers expected in parts of the island

The Meteorology Department says several spells of showers will occur in the Western, Sabaragamuwa and North-western provinces and in Kandy, Nuwara-Eliya, Galle and Matara districts.

Showers or thundershowers may occur at several places in Eastern and Uva provinces during the evening or night.

Strong winds of about 40-45 kmph can be expected at times over the western slopes of the central hills and in Northern, North-central, and North-western provinces and in Hambantota, Monaragala and Trincomalee districts, it added.

Thus, the general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
