Oatmeal…a mild exfoliant

This week I’ve decided to touch on oatmeal (or oats), which is available at supermarkets.

Oatmeal acts as a mild exfoliant, removing dead skin cells and promoting a smoother complexion.

The combination of oatmeal and milk provides hydration, leaving your skin feeling soft and moisturized.

The preparation is simple. All you have to do is to blend a small amount of oatmeal with enough milk to create a thick, spreadable paste.

Before applying this mixture, you need to cleanse your face: Start with a clean face to ensure optimal absorption of the face pack.

Using clean fingers, or a brush, apply the mixture evenly to your face, avoiding the eye area.

After application, gently massage the mixture onto your skin, in circular motions. This aids in exfoliation.

Allow the face pack to dry for about 15-20 minutes, or until it feels tight, but not uncomfortable.

Once dry, rinse off the mixture with lukewarm water, using gentle, circular motions to maximize the exfoliating effect.

Pat your face dry and follow up with your regular moisturizer to lock in the hydration.

It’s suitable for most skin types, especially those in need of a mild exfoliation and hydration boost.
