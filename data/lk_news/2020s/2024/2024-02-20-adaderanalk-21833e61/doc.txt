The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is expected to hand over the proposals pertaining to the revision of electricity tariffs to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) within the next two days, Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera said.

Wijesekera made this announcement while addressing the Parliament this morning (20 Feb.), opining that the Ministry anticipates a significant reduction in electricity tariffs.

The Minister clarified that the projected expenses of the CEB for the current year encompassed costs associated with maintenance projects initiated over the past four years, set to conclude within the year.
