Storm petrel pinioned

The law finally caught up with former MP Hirunika Premachandra on Friday. Having been found guilty of the abduction, wrongful detention and assault of a youth in December 2015, and sentenced to three-year RI, she is languishing behind bars. She is expected to appeal against her conviction. As a lawyer, Hirunika should have known better than to take the law into her own hands. What possessed her to commit the crime that has landed her in prison?

Hirunika and several others committed the aforesaid offences during the heyday of the UNP-led Yahapalana government. The UNP-led UNF was ensconced in power and President Maithripala Sirisena was going strong at the time. Hirunika, like the other young UNF MPs in the good books of the government leaders of the day may have thought she was above the law.

The problem with political power is that it goes to the heads of those who wield it, and have the same effect as intoxicants on them. Hence, the politicians of the party/coalition in power take leave of their senses and become oblivious to the consequences of their actions. One may recall how an otherwise amiable Ranjan Ramanayake behaved during the Yahapalana  government, telephoning and instructing even high-ranking police officers until he was humbled by the judiciary; he was imprisoned for contempt of court. The sobering reality dawned on him while he was serving time.

Hirunika has been a storm petrel of sorts. She was instrumental in exposing the defectus or vulnerability of the Rajapaksa fortress, as it were, and instilling anti-government protesters with confidence that it could be brought down like the Walls of Jericho. On 05 March 2022, she held a women’s protest near the then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s Mirihana residence, and emboldened others to do likewise. She also staged a protest near the President’s House, Fort, on 06 July 2022, about three days before thousands of anti-government activists stormed the place, making President Rajapaksa head for the hills. She also incurred the wrath of the leaders of the incumbent dispensation by launching scathing verbal attacks on them and their close friends.

The killers of The Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickremetunge, popular sportsman, Wasim Thajudeen, and several others have not been brought to justice. The tardiness of police investigations into those crimes reminds us of a popular Avurudu cycling contest, where the slowest rider is adjudged the winner, and the contestants do their darndest to move as slow as possible. New foreign exchange control laws were introduced in 2017, and about 30 fraudsters who would have faced incarceration got away with the criminal offences they had committed under the previous Act, which had more teeth. Politicians who make a vulgar display of their wealth, despite their humble beginnings, have the last laugh when legal action is taken against them after regime changes.

The taxman looks the other way, and the national anti-graft commission is not equal to the task of prosecuting them properly. Above all, those who plunged the country into a bloodbath in the late 1980s, snuffing out thousands of lives, destroying public property worth billions of rupees, robbing banks and the public, and the perpetrators of equally heinous crimes in the name of counterterror have got off scot-free. A man who trespassed on a former President’s estate, and stole a few coconuts was shot the other day, but the Presidents, who are accused of indulging in corrupt practices, abusing power, jeopardising national security and ruining the economy, are looked after the by the State until they go the way of all flesh.

There are many politicians who are ‘more equal than others’ before the law like the Pigs in Orwell’s dystopian novella, Animal Farm. If only the law applied equally to everyone in this country.

The judicial gavel blow that has shocked Hirunika into realising that she is not above the law is most welcome, and it is hoped that it will serve as a deterrent for others of her ilk. However, on witnessing the prevailing culture of impunity, the selective law enforcement, and the shameful impotence of the long arm of the law and the state prosecutors vis-à-vis powerful politicians and their kith and kin, we cannot but echo the words of Mr. Bumble in Oliver Twist— ‘The law is an ass’.
