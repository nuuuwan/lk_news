Two killed after car collides with 2 trains at Enderamulla

Two persons including a woman have been killed after their car collided with two trains at the Enderamulla railway crossing this morning (08), police said.

A Colombo-bound night mail train from Badulla had collided with the car, which was traveling from Enderamulla towards Wattala, when it had reportedly attempted to pass through the crossing despite the signal lights warning of the oncoming train.

Following the collision with the first train, the car had been dragged around 200 meters forward and residents in the area had rushed to rescue the occupants of the car.

However, as they were attempting to rescue the driver and passenger of the car, another train arriving from the opposite direction on the parallel track, and bound for Trincomalee, had also collided with the vehicle.

A 56-year-old man from Biyagama and a 44-year-old woman, who was employed as a security officer at a private company in Colombo, were killed on the spot, according to reports.
