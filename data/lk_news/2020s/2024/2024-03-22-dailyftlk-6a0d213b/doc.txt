Speaker breezes through NCM with Govt. support

Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena yesterday survived the No Confidence Motion brought against him by the Opposition after it was defeated by 42 votes in Parliament.

The vote on the No Confidence Motion, the first of its kind against a sitting Speaker of Parliament in Sri Lanka’s history was held following a three-day debate during which the Opposition accused him of partisan behaviour among many other allegations.

117 MPs had voted against the motion while 75 voted in favour. Accordingly, Abeywardena will now continue in his role as the Speaker of the Sri Lankan Parliament.

Opposition parties, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), National People’s Power (NPP), Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) and independent MPs including Wimal Weerawasa, Udaya Gammanpila, and Prof G.L. Peiris voted in favour of the motion.

Meanwhile, National Congress MP A.L.M. Athaullah, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MP Angajan Ramanathan and SJB MP Vadivel Suresh joined Government MPs to vote against it. MPs Jagath Samarawickrama, Nimal Lansa and Priyankara Jayaratne also voted against it.

Opposition parties under the leadership of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) commenced the signing of the no-confidence motion against Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena on 26 February following which it was handed over to the Deputy General Secretary of Parliament on 5 March.

The Opposition accused the Speaker of ignoring directives of the Supreme Court in relation to the Online Safety Bill and using his deciding vote unconstitutionally and illegally when appointing the Inspector General of Police.
