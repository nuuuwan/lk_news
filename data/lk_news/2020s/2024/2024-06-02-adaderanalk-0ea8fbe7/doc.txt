All schools closed tomorrow

The Ministry of Education has decided that all schools across the island will remain closed tomorrow, according to State Minister of Education Aravind Kumar.

He said the decision has been reached in consideration of the prevailing adverse weather conditions across Sri Lanka.

It was previously announced that the Provincial Education Secretaries and Directors have been authorised to make a decision on whether or not to hold schools tomorrow (June 03).

However, it has now been decided to close all government schools islandwide due to the prevailing inclement weather conditions.
