Hasaranga returns, Sri Lanka to bat in T20 series decider against Bangladesh

Sri Lanka were put into bat first in the third and final T20I against Bangladesh in Sylhet, as suspended captain Wanindu Hasaranga returned to the side after serving a two-match suspension.

Hasaranga replaced left-arm fast bowler Dilshan Madushanka, while Nuwan Thushara came in for the injured Matheesha Pathirana, who was ruled out of today's T20I with a grade 1 hamstring injury on his left leg.

Sri Lanka won the opening T20I between the two teams on Monday by three runs, before Bangladesh recorded a comfortable eight-wicket win in the second match of the series.
