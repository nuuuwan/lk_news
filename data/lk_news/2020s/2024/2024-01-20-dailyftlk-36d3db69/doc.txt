Two MRPs for one and the same product

How come a locally manufactured full cream milk powder is being marketed at two MRPs â€“ Rs. 850.00 and Rs 1080.00? The details of this milk powder are as follows:

a. The net weight printed on the obverse of the pack is the same i.e. 400 g.

b. The nutrient content of the milk powder is exactly the same as per the nutritional information printed on the reverse of the pack.

c. The manufacturer is the same viz Pelwatte Dairy Industries Ltd. Buttala

f. The date of manufacture and the expiry date are almost the same.

Hope the manufacturer will respond to this letter. Is the Consumer Affairs Authority of Sri Lanka aware of this locally produced milk powder being sold at two different prices and is it permissible according to the Consumer Affairs Authority Act No 09 of 2003?
