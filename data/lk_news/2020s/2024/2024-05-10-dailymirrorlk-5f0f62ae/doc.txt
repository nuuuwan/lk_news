Sri Lanka Cricket raises player fees across all formats

Colombo, May 10 -Â  Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has decided to enhance player welfare and incentivizing performance by announcing substantial increases in player fees across all formats, effective immediately.

The decision, aimed at recognizing the efforts and dedication of Sri Lanka's international cricketers, will see 41 players being offered new contracts under six categories: A1, A2, B2, C1, C2, and the 'A' Team.

One of the most notable changes comes in the Test format, where match fees have been doubled, marking a 100 percent increase. Moreover, payments for Test matches will now be determined on a merit basis, reflecting the player's performance and contribution to the team's success.

For One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is), match fees have been raised by a commendable 25 percent, acknowledging the challenges and intensity of these shorter formats.

In a move to further recognize excellence, Sri Lanka Cricket has decided to reward players who achieve top rankings in the ICC Player Rankings. Players attaining the title of 'Best Batsman,' 'Best Bowler,' or 'Best All-Rounder' across all formats will receive a special one-time payment.

In addition, players ranking between 2nd and 10th place in the ICC rankings will also be acknowledged with a one-time payment for their outstanding performances.
