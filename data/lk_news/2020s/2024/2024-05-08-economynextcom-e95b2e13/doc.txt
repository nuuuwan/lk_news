Diana Gamage becomes 12th MP to be out of 2020-elected parliament

ECONOMYNEXT – Diana Gamage became the 12th Member of Parliament to be out of the island nation’s legislature that was elected in the 2020 general elections either due to death or resignation or legal actions, official data showed.

A three-judge Supreme Court bench on Wednesday decided that State Tourism Minister Diana Gamage is not eligible to hold an MP post after a legal case challenging her eligibility over holding the MP post due to her citizenship.

Gamage was accused of breaching immigration laws and hiding credentials over her citizenship.

Gamage entered the parliament through the national list under the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB)

Sri Lanka constitution has barred duel citizens for foreign citizens holding MP post in its latest amendment.

With Gamage’s removal, the current parliament has witnessed seven MPs from ruling Sri Lanka Pudijana Party (SLPP), four from opposition SJB, and one from minority Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) have lost the seats from the parliament.

The details of the MPs are out of the current parliament elected in 2020:

K H Nandasena (SLPP, died) Amarakeerthi Athukorala (SLPP, murdered), Sanath Nishantha (SLPP, died), Ranjan Ramanayaka (SJB, lost the seat due to legal action), Ajith Nivard Cabraal (SLPP, resigned), Mahinda Samarasinghe (SLPP, resigned), Basil Rajapaksa (SLPP, resigned), Mujibur Rahuman (SJB, resigned), Chaminda Wijesiri (SJB, resigned), Uddika Premarathne (SLPP, resigned), and Naseer Ahamed (SLMC, lost due to court ruling.
