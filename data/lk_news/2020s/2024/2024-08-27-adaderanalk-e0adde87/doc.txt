Supreme Court slams IGP, Police Commission over ignoring directives on detainees

The Supreme Court has expressed its dissatisfaction with the lack of progress in preventing police brutality, despite the court’s repeated orders aimed at curbing the alleged torture of individuals in police custody.

Making a statement in the open court, the three-member Supreme Court judge bench, chaired by Justice S. Thurairaja, noted that neither the National Police Commission nor the Inspector General of Police (IGP) has taken necessary steps to implement the Supreme Court orders pertaining to the matter.

Justice Thurairaja further pointed out that no reports have been submitted by the aforesaid authorities in response to the court’s directives, which include various orders, warnings, and guidelines designed to prevent the mistreatment of detainees.

The Supreme Court judge bench made this statement during the hearing of a fundamental rights petition filed by two student activists, Ada Derana reporter said.

The activists allege that they were subjected to physical abuse and humiliation by police officers during a protest organized by students of the University of Kelaniya in 2009.
