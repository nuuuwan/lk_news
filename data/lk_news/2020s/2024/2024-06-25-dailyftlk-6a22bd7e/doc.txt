Uvindu Wijeweera criticises JVP’s deviation from founding principles

Criticises JVP for veering off course from its original anti-imperialist and socialist stance

Expresses disillusionment with JVP’s current trajectory and predicts potential electoral setbacks

Slams JVP’s current stance on 13A and its position on Indian influence in SL

Claims JVP has sacrificed its foundational principles in favour of gaining political advantage

Second Generation organisation leader Uvindu Wijeweera has accused the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) formed by his father Rohana Wijeweera of straying from its original principles and policies.

Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Wijeweera criticised the JVP for forsaking the foundational principles established by his father. Expressing disillusionment with the trajectory of the JVP, he remarked that the party has veered off course and will likely face defeat as a political movement.

The leftist JVP now heads the National People’s Power (NPP), which includes 27 other political parties, worker unions, women’s rights groups, and youth organisations. Recently, the JVP has somewhat moved away from its historically extreme leftist policies and has moderated its position on several contentious issues, including the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.

He accused the JVP of abandoning its founding principles, particularly in relation to the 13th Amendment of the Constitution and its stance on Indian influence in Sri Lanka.

Wijeweera also pointed out that the current stance of the JVP represents a significant departure from its original anti-imperialist position.

“The JVP’s inconsistency on the 13th Amendment and their failure to oppose ‘Indian imperialism’ demonstrate their divergence from the principles upheld by my father and the party’s founding members,” he said.  Wijeweera accused the JVP of abandoning its early ideals in pursuit of political advantage.

He alleged that the JVP was originally renowned for its staunch anti-imperialist and socialist stance, aiming to address socio-economic inequalities in Sri Lanka through radical change. According to him, these principles are no longer evident in the JVP today. Uvindu Wijeweera has previously stated his intention to run in the upcoming Parliamentary elections.
