Doing it in Sinhala, as well

JPal (Janaka Palapathwala), who is known for his Elvis/Jim Reeves style of singing, didn’t forget his fans on Valentine’s Day.

He wished music lovers, for Valentine’s Day, on YouTube with the song ‘And The Grass Won’t Pay No Mind.’

Although his song repertoire is generally made up of Elvis and Jim Reeves material, he says he is now seriously thinking of doing two Sinhala originals and, eventually, a Sinhala album.

In fact, Janaka indicated to us that the recording of the Sinhala songs will soon be completed, and then he will finalise the visuals for the two songs.

“Once that is completed, I will work on the material for the album.”

Janaka also went on to say that without Sinhala songs, it’s very difficult to make it big in Sri Lanka.

“The masses, and the electronic media, won’t accept anything other than Sinhala, so we need to give them what they want.”

Janaka decided to shorten his name to JPal because of his foreign assignments.

“Those abroad find it difficult to pronounce Janaka Palapathwala,” he said.
