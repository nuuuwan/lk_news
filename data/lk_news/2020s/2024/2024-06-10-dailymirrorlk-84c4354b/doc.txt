Train cancellations continue as strike enters fourth day

The Railway Department announced that 20 office trains were cancelled this morning (10) due to the ongoing strike by train drivers, which is now on its fourth day.

The strike began at midnight on Thursday, June 6 in protest of delays in second-class promotions for locomotive drivers, slow recruitment processes and several other issues.
