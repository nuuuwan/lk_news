Ehelepola Walawwa to be handed over to Dalada Maligawa

Colombo, April 2 (Daily Mirror) - In accordance with a decision at the Cabinet meeting held on February 19, approval was granted to hand over the Ehelepola Walawwa to the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa).

The decision was taken after the President and Secretary had been informed to discuss this matter with all the relevant parties and submit a report with recommendations for Cabinet approval.

Accordingly, the report has recommended that the Ehelepola Walawwa be transferred to the Temple of the Tooth Relic since a project has been prepared by the Temple, aiming to present information on history in a more attractive way to the present society by establishing a museum in this building to represent the great historical and environmental background of the Kingdom of Kandy that existed hundreds of years ago.

It has also been recommended that the Ehelepola Walawwa be converted into a wax museum that reflects the past historic culture and represents all historic facts with the target of attracting local and foreign tourists.

Accordingly, the Cabinet approved the proposal presented by the President to hand over the Ehelepola Walawwa and the grounds to the Temple of the Tooth Relic through a title deed of sacred premises.
