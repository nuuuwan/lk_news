Turncoats, sataka and coattails

SLPP founder Basil Rajapaksa once said in a television interview that the blame for the wrongs the SLPP was alleged to have committed should be apportioned to the people who had voted for the incumbent government. He came under an avalanche of criticism for saying so, but his argument is not without some merit. What reminded us of Basil’s aforesaid claim was a remark made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, at a meeting with media heads and news editors/directors, in Colombo, on Wednesday.

When it was pointed out by a journalist that there were very serious allegations against most of the SLPP MPs who had switched their allegiance to him, the President said he did not prevent legal action from being taken against anyone, and if the people rejected the MPs facing such allegations at a parliamentary election, the problem would be over.

True, the problem of rogues being elected to political institutions is best tackled at source; the people must not vote for them. But that is no reason why political party leaders should continue to nominate crooks of all sorts to contest polls and/or enlist their support to win elections. Political parties must also stop abusing the National List mechanism to catapult rejected candidates, including crooks, to Parliament.

The task of dealing with the corrupt in the garb of politicians must not be left entirely to the public, for the resentful people, instead of using the ballot for that purpose, tend to take the law into their own hands when they seek to mete out punishment to the crooks who enrich themselves at the expense of the country. What we witnessed in 2022 could be considered a case in point.

Going by some of the views expressed by President Wickremesinghe, on Wednesday, about the ruling party members supporting him, he seems to think they have decamped to help him secure the presidency. They have sided with him for their own sake. They are trying to make use of their involvement in his presidential election campaign to shore up their chances of being re-elected at the next general election. They are driven by self-interest. Otherwise, they would not have deserted Mahinda Rajapaksa, whom they used to call ‘appachchi’ (father). Most of the SLPP MPs who have chosen to back Namal Rajapaksa in the presidential fray are no better.

It is doubtful whether the SLPP MPs who clung on to the Rajapaksas’ sataka until recently before opting for a ride on the coattails of President Wickremesinghe are capable of mustering enough popular support for anyone to win an election. It may be recalled that they could not even help the SLPP win most samupakara or co-operative society elections. They were also scared of facing the local government polls, which were postponed, last year for a second time, on some flimsy pretext.

They are worried about their re-election more than anything else. Many of them cannot visit their electorates, much less conduct election campaigns. So, the question is whether they are equal to the task of ensuring anyone’s victory in a presidential election. Most of them entered Parliament in 2020 thanks to Mahinda, whom some of them were seen worshipping in public. They are now like the proverbial cobra which, in its wisdom, deserted its charmer and tried to dance on its own, only to be beaten up by onlookers.

One of the main reasons for the defeat of the Mahinda Rajapaksa government in 2015 was the so-called vroom mania of the members of the ruling family and their cronies. They held vehicle parades and car races much to the consternation of the public.

Old habits are said to die hard. SLPP MP and former Minister Rohitha Abeygunawardena made a grand show of his defection from the SLPP, in Kalutara, on Sunday. He held a motorcycle parade before announcing his support for President Wickremesinghe in the presidential race. He is alleged to have committed a punishable offence by riding an unregistered high-powered motorcycle. The SLPP politicians who have propped up the incumbent administration have not learnt from their past blunders. Many of them have now become President Wickremesinghe’s problem.
