Improvements in Govt.’s approval ratings exert positive impact on CSE

Yesterday’s CSE performance reflected a significant improvement on the share market front due to steady improvements in the approval ratings of the government in the area of economic decision making. This new survey was released by Verite Research last week, which indicated that the government’s approval rating on all economic activities increased to 24 percent from 10 percent.

Over three times as many people feel better about the economy and the country’s economic trajectory compared to four months ago, according to this latest round of the Gallup-style ‘Mood of the Nation’ poll by Verité Research.

The survey revealed that the approval rating of the government more than tripled to 24 percent in July, up from 7% in February 2024. Current economic conditions were rated as either “good” or “excellent” by 28 percent of respondents, marking a threefold increase from 9 percent in February 2024. The number of people who believe that the country’s economic conditions are “getting better” has tripled, with 30% of respondents holding this view, up from 9 percent in February 2024.

Amid those developments both indices moved upwards. The All Share Price Index went up by 48.16 points while S and P SL20 was up by 22.97 points. Turnover stood at Rs 1.56 billion with two crossings. Those crossings were reported in JKH, which crossed 3.2 million shares to the tune of Rs 620 million and its shares traded at Rs 194 and Hemas Holdings 1.5 million shares crossed for Rs 124 million; its shares traded at Rs 81.4 million.

In the retail market top seven companies that mainly contributed to the turnover were; JKH Rs 158 million (815,000 shares traded), Ceylinco Insurance Rs 151.9 million (61000 shares traded), Commercial Bank Rs 57.4 million (550,000 shares traded), Hayleys Fabrics Rs 45.1 million (84000 shares traded), Distilleries Rs 25.9 million (997,000 shares traded), Commercial Bank (Non- Voting) Rs 22.9 million (280,000 shares traded) and LOLC Finance Rs 23 million (3.7 million shares traded). During the day 29.1 million share volumes changed hands in 7500 transactions.
