Dilith urges to use votes to put an end to ‘politics of thieves’

The presidential candidate of ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ alliance Dilith Jayaweera emphasized that his national strategic plan is not about empty promises but rather a strategic program designed for real-world implementation.

Speaking during a public rally held in Akuressa, Jayaweera stated: “This is not just another document of promises. In the history of Sri Lankan politics, this is possibly the first time a strategic program like this has been presented in a presidential election since independence.”

He also mentioned that his proposal is a roadmap to realizing the dream of a developed Sri Lanka, aligning with the hopes and aspirations of the people.

Furthermore, Jayaweera invited voters to support his vision by marking the star symbol on their ballots, symbolizing their commitment to a future built on love and integrity.

He urged the public to use their valuable vote to put an end their anger and hate against the “politics of thieves” which is prevalent in the country.
