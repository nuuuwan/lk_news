RW’s “judicial cannibalism” stirs up a storm

The topics of the judiciary and its independence were a recurring theme during last week’s parliamentary sittings. Both government and opposition MPs took turns discussing various aspects of the judiciary, with some using their parliamentary privileges to criticize judges and the courts.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe led the baton charge on Tuesday morning, explaining his stance on the recent Supreme Court determination on the constitutionality of the Gender Equality Bill. Using the words “judicial cannibalism”, he found fault with the court for holding that the Bill violated the powers of Parliament under Article 4 of the Constitution and called for the appointment of a parliamentary select committee to study and make recommendations on this matter. But he did say he was not proposing summoning judges before the select committee.

His choice of words and focus on that judgment attracted both positive and negative reactions within and outside the House as well as in various forums beyond.

Shortly after the president’s statement, TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran suggested that it would be better to refer the Bill back to the Supreme Court for a re-evaluation rather than challenging its decision. He also expressed concern that appointing a select committee to review a Supreme Court decision could lead to unintended consequences.

These two positions formed the main thrust of discussion throughout the week’s sitting both in and out of the House. Many government and opposition MPs talking to each other in parliament’s lobbies and corridors were trying to figure out the president’s real intention in challenging the country’s apex court. Some argued that the attempt to appoint a select committee might lead to a clash between the judiciary and the legislature, which was considered the last thing the country needed at this time.

After his speech, the president visited the opposition lobby on the second floor of the Parliaemnt complex and chatted with opposition MPs on the emerging political picture. Maithripala Sirisena was also present and remarked that he was relieved his presidency was limited to five years, allowing him to avoid the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic repercussions. When an MP jokingly suggested that crises during Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s tenure might have been attributed to Sirisena, the president chuckled but made no comment.

When Gampaha District SJB MP Harshana Rajakaruna passed by, the president said he had heard about an incident involving the MP and a woman at the Kotte SJB office. Rajakaruna said the incident took place not at the SJB Kotte office but at the opposition leader’s office at No 30 Marcus Fernando Mawatha. He described it as a minor incident that was quickly resolved.

Some opposition MPs complained to the President that senior public servants had been granted duty-free vehicle permits but MPs permits have not yet been issued creating many problems for them. The president seeing Sajith Premadasa passing told them to make that request through the opposition leader and he would then discuss it with government MPs to find a solution.

“Here goes the opposition leader. Tell him your problems,” the president said.

Premadasa continued to walk away saying that he heard nothing, and his ears were sealed.

Sirisena quipped that silence could be termed as an ‘yes’ in a court case, and Premadasa’s silence too could be counted as an approval for the opposition MPs request.

Wickremesinghe stayed on in parliament participating in both the government group meeting and the cabinet meeting. By evening, many government MPs correctly anticipated that the comments on the judiciary would dominate discussions throughout the week. Some MPs met with the president and supported his proposal to appoint a select committee, citing instances where they felt the judiciary had hindered parliamentary processes and politics.

When the president met with government MPs, some raised the issue of the Constitutional Council rejecting his proposal to grant a service extension to the current Attorney General. Upon hearing MPs argue that the stance taken by three civil society members of the council was legally wrong, the president nodded but remained silent. A legal officer present noted that the law does not prohibit a president from resubmitting a nomination that had been previously rejected by the council. Sitting beside the president, Ashu Marasinghe asked whether the same nominee would be put forward again for consideration; the President smiled without responding.

The following day, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said that the phrase ‘judicial cannibalism,’ simply meant the judiciary was encroaching upon the province of the legislature which is responsible for lawmaking. “When the court attempts to make laws or usurp the duties of the legislature, it creates a crisis because it undermines the doctrine of separation of powers,” he said.

He didn’t stop there but continued to criticize judges and courts. He said that unethical conduct of a handful of judges has led to erosion of public faith in the judiciary. He cited examples of judges taking bribes, illegally tapping electricity and water lines, stealing whiskey from court record rooms etc etc.

“There was an instance where two investigations confirmed that a Magistrate living in a bungalow next to the Mount Lavinia court had tapped both electricity and water supply lines to the court and helped himself to a reduced bill. This was uncovered when another judge complained of this illegal act to the Judicial Service Commission. The Commission sent an electrician to investigate and he nearly got electrocuted. He had to be admitted to the ICU to save his life. People point out that tapping water and electricity supply lines were non-bailable offences and question what action has been taken against the errant judge,” the minister said.

In opposition circles, some suggested that Minister Rajapakshe was reacting to recent court rulings regarding his bid for the SLFP’s presidential candidacy leading to his criticism of judges. Another MP remarked that the judge in question appeared to be struggling financially, implying that if judges cannot live on their salaries and resort to theft, it reflects poorly on the judiciary. Yet another MP viewed the Justice Minister’s entire diatribe as a significant condemnation of the country’s judiciary.

Earlier on the same day, SLPP dissident MP Dayasiri Jayasekera passionately raised a privilege issue, criticizing courts and judges. He claimed that his privileges were violated due to court orders that prevented him from actively participating in politics. He emphasized the importance of courts maintaining political neutrality.

On Thursday, NPP MP Harini Amarasuriya remarked that the Gender Equality Bill was hastily drafted, leading to numerous errors and weak provisions. She criticized the lack of proper discussion in the media and other forums, which would have allowed stakeholders to express their views on the Bill’s objectives. She expressed concern that certain provisions in the Bill, instead of protecting vulnerable groups, could worsen the existing situation.

Participating in the second reading debate on the Women Empowerment Bill, Dr. Amarasuriya said that the Supreme Court acted appropriately when a draft Bill containing vague and conflicting provisions was referred to it. Therefore, she emphasized that blaming the court for mistakes in Bill’s drafting process was unjustified.

SJB MP Imthiaz Bakeer Markar expressed concerns about attempts to manipulate the judiciary and the processes of the Attorney General’s Department. He urged Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena not to allow Parliament to be used for such manipulations and to take steps to uphold its dignity and independence.

On Tuesday the House debated five Orders made under the Tourism Act, three Regulations made under the Registration of Title Act, Crown Lands Ordinance and Convention Against Doping in Sports Act. On Wednesday Regulations and an Order under the Casino Business (Regulation) Act, a Resolution under the Coconut Development Act and Regulations under the Colombo Port City Economic Commission Act were taken for debate. On Thursday the House passed the Women Empowerment Bill with amendments and the Sri Lanka National Commission for UNESCO Bill. The House meets again on July 09.
