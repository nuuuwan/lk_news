Ranil talks to the Sunday papers, fields wide-ranging questions

President Ranil Wickremesinghe met with journalists from Sunday newspapers at his Paget Road office complex on Thursday. During the meeting, he discussed his campaign strategy, his approach to ensuring long-term stability, and his views on other presidential candidates, while also addressing various allegations against him. He expressed confidence in his upcoming victory and indicated the programs proposed by his rivals were not feasible.

Q: Are you seeking a vote of gratitude or a mandate to advance the IMF bailout program?

A:I didn’t know there was gratitude in Sri Lanka’s politics, but what I am focused on is stabilizing the economy and moving beyond the crisis, which is only temporary. We need to consolidate the economy and ensure that the crisis does not recur. We must shift towards an export-oriented economy. First and foremost, I want to make the cost of living more affordable. While we have made progress, it’s still not enough. As we address the needs of the current generation, particularly Gen Z, I also want to secure a good future. Since we all came together to reach this point when no one else was available, I urge Sri Lankans to consider their future and vote with that future in mind.

A:We have successfully steered the country out of the crisis, but further stabilization is needed. Without this stabilization, there is a risk of sliding back into crisis. For instance, if we compare the promises in the NPP manifesto with the national budget for the coming year, we find a deficit of Rs 4,000 billion between income and expenditure, which is equivalent to 11.9 percent of GDP. Generally, we can only afford a deficit of up to 5 percent of GDP because that is the maximum amount we can borrow. If we exceed this limit, the value of the dollar could rise to Rs 400-425. If we were to propose a deficit of 11.9 percent of GDP to the IMF, along with the 18 other countries providing us with relief, they would likely withdraw their support. This would cause the dollar’s value to increase to around Rs 500. While borrowing more than five percent of GDP is possible from the market, it would come with an interest rate of 25 percent.

Q: NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake has stated that you call him ‘good friend’ with ulterior motives.

A: I used the term ‘good friend’ in accordance with parliamentary tradition, where opposition MPs are often addressed this way. He seemed to be upset by this, and I was informed that my choice of address caused significant trouble within their politburo. Consequently, I switched to referring to him as the former Agriculture Minister. However, I was then told that this also displeased him because it highlights his previous involvement in governance. I now need to find an appropriate way to address him.

A:Yes, I have read both manifestos. The SJB has two documents: one is the “Semata Jayak” (A Win for All) concept, and the other is the Economic Blueprint 3.0. Both contain numerous promises. Additionally, Sajith Premadasa makes further promises during his speeches, including lowering the prices of essential goods while simultaneously increasing expenditures. The contradictions in these promises, especially concerning the tourism industry and agriculture, raise questions about how they will be delivered.

The NPP manifesto, which is 232 pages long, took me one night to read. I found their economic policy unclear. They seem uncertain whether they are pursuing an export-oriented or import-oriented economy. For example, a recent rally by the former Agriculture Minister emphasized an export-oriented economy, yet their manifesto suggests otherwise by proposing the elimination of free trade agreements (FTAs). If they end FTAs, it’s unclear how they plan to promote an export-oriented economy.

Moreover, NPP members Sunil Handunnetti and Dr. Harshana Sooriyapperuma have spoken against the Economic Transformation Bill. The NPP manifesto appears to rely on printing more money, which could lead to economic collapse.

I challenged Anura Kumara Dissanayake to debate their economic policy with me. I suggested that Dissanayake, along with Handunnetti and Sooriyapperuma, first clarify their party’s economic stance in a separate debate. I proposed organizing a video discussion that would include myself, Dissanayake, and Kristalina Georgieva, the Managing Director of the IMF. If they respond by this weekend, we can arrange a debate with the IMF on Monday or Tuesday. I have not yet received a response.

Q: The best qualification you have is solving financial crisis. The opposition criticizes that you secured this qualification by not paying foreign loans.

A:The reality is that we have continued to make payments on many foreign loans and their associated interest. We have kept up with interest payments; what remains is the repayment of the principal. Debt sustainability involves two key elements: first, a government’s ability to sustain its current spending, and second, having sufficient funds to repay its debts. This requires effective management of tax and other policies over the long term to avoid threatening government solvency or defaulting on liabilities or promised expenditures. We are committed to achieving debt sustainability in our agreement with the IMF.

Q: Reconciliation is also an urgent need. How are you going to address reconciliation-related issues in the North and the East?

A:This is the first presidential election in recent history that has not been dominated by ethnic or religious issues. We have initiated discussions on the concerns of people in the North, including issues related to the 13th Amendment. It is crucial to advance these discussions. Provincial councils play a significant role in a massive development drive, as they are central to local development and should be empowered to lead these efforts.

We have made progress on land issues and are working towards implementing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Additionally, we are moving forward with the recommendations of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry for the Appraisal of the Findings of Previous Commissions and Committees, headed by Supreme Court Judge A. H. M. D. Nawaz. We have also introduced a bill addressing Muslim burial rights.

Q: It is often heard from your camp that no other presidential candidates could continue the crisis resolution program you have initiated, and if they tried, the system would collapse within six months. Does this mean you created this program to prevent anyone else from succeeding?

A:No, that is not the case. The program can be continued by anyone who is committed to its implementation. The issue is that some candidates, such as those from the NPP, are proposing to deviate from this path, which is not feasible. Even if I myself were to diverge from this route, the risk of collapse would be imminent. The path we are on is clear and necessary for maintaining stability.

Q: You have been accused of abusing public funds and state resources for your election campaigning. Is that true?

A:Please specify where and when I have used public money or resources inappropriately. The allegation often arises because I increased public sector salaries. Is it a crime to raise the salaries of public servants? These increased salaries do not benefit me personally, and some of those public servants may not even vote for me.

A:I am prepared to face either of them. There are also other candidates in the mix. However, the real issue is not the individuals themselves but their programs, which are not practical given our current situation. We have managed to achieve some stability, unlike the Maldives, which is edging towards a financial crisis, or Bangladesh, which is experiencing anarchy. The choice for the people is whether we want to return to crisis conditions or continue on the path we have charted. Neither Sajith nor Anura offers viable solutions for the challenges we face; they remain stuck in outdated approaches. I am committed to a new direction.
