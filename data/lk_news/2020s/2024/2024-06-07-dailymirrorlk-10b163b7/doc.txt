Most flood deaths caused by reckless behavior: DMC

June 07 (Daily Mirror) - The causes of most of the deaths reported during floods are due to careless bathing, attempting to cross submerged roads and unsafe boating practices, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) Director Pradeep Kodippli said.

A total of 24 individuals lost their lives due to incidents like trees or soil collapsing on them, drowning and being swept away by floodwaters, he said.

Additionally, 239,006 persons from 63,413 families were affected, with 16 sustaining injuries. There was only one person reported missing due to the floods.

A total of 118 boats were used by the Sri Lanka Army to rescue the affected people, while the Sri Lanka Navy had assigned 31 boats.

Kodippili urged people to refrain from visiting flood-affected areas or stepping into floodwaters.
