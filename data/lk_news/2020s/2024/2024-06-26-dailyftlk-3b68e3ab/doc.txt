The annual National Business Excellence Awards highlight excellence in various domains, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and sustainable growth within the business community. The NBEA’s rigorous three-stage evaluation process underscores the significance of these accolades. Applications were initially screened for conformity and then reviewed in detail by a technical panel. The shortlisted companies proceeded to the second stage, where interviews were conducted to allocate marks based on sector-specific criteria. The final stage involved a thorough review by the Panel of Judges, who selected the award recipients based on comprehensive evaluation reports and interview outcomes.

Criteria included excellence in corporate governance, strategy, capacity building, performance management, local and global market reach, corporate social responsibility, and environmental sustainability.

“This recognition is a testament to the hard work and commitment of our entire team. It inspires us to continue our pursuit of excellence and innovation. We extend our gratitude to the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka, our partners, and our customers for their continuous support,” Wegapitiya added.
