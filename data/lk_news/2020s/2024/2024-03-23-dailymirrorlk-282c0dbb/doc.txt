Colombo, March 23 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka has witnessed a surge in non-communicable diseases, prompting action from the Ministry of Health.

This was revealed by Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana today (23) at the launching event of the "Suva Udana" mobile health clinic programme in Yakkalamulla, Galle.

The programme, which marks the 14th such initiative this year, seeks to extend healthcare services to rural communities.

Speaking at the event, Minister Pathirana highlighted the increasing prevalence of non-communicable diseases across the country.

The mobile clinic offers a comprehensive range of services, including dental care, laboratory tests, eye clinics and screenings for blood sugar, fat levels, body mass index and blood pressure.
