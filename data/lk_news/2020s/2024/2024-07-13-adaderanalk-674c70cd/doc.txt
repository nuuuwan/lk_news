One person has reportedly died while 05 others have been wounded and hospitalised following a clash between two groups during a musical show held in the Morayaya area in Weeraketiya.

The murder was reportedly committed using a sharp weapon, police said.

The deceased is identified as a 30-year-old resident of Morayaya, Weeraketiya.

Five others were injured in the incident and have been admitted to Tangalle and Embilipitiya hospitals for treatment.

However, their condition is not serious, according to a hospital spokesperson.

However, the group had then proceeded to assault the organising committee member who had intervened. As a result of this, other members of the organising committee had then attacked the group of youths in question while one of them had used a sharp weapon.

Due to the attack by that group, six people were injured by the members of the organising committee, and one of them succumbed to injuries after being admitted to Weeraketiya Hospital.

The body has been placed in the Weeraketiya Hospital mortuary, and a suspect has been arrested in connection with the murder.
