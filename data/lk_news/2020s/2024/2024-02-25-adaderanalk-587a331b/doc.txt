Thorough investigation to be conducted on notice sent to Russian, Ukraine tourists – Public Security Ministry

The Ministry of Public Security has asserted that Government of Sri Lanka has not made any decision thus far pertaining to Russian and Ukrainian tourists despite recent reports, adding that the matter will be thoroughly investigated.

Accordingly, a thorough investigation is to be carried out into the recent notification issued to Russian and Ukrainian tourists by the Department of Immigration and Emigration, requiring them to leave the country within 14 days.

Meanwhile, earlier today (25 Feb.), President Ranil Wickremesinghe had also ordered an investigation into the matter.

According to the President’s Media Division (PMD), the relevant notice had been issued without approval from the Cabinet of Ministers.

The Department of Immigration and Emigration recently issued a notice, granting a period of 14 days from 23 February for all Russian and Ukrainian tourists residing long-term in Sri Lanka to leave the country.

The department had stated that it would no longer keep extending tourist visas free of charge for Russians and Ukrainians who had started staying back in Sri Lanka two years ago, owing to the war.

The decision had reportedly been taken owing to concerns over certain foreign tourists running illegal businesses in the country.
