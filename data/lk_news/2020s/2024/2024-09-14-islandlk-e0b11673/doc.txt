Cabinet approves implementing ‘Trade Facilitation Action Plan 2025-2028”’

In the year 2016, Cabinet approval was granted for the establishment of a National Trade Felicitation Committee for the empowerment of the Trade Felicitation Agreement (TFA) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the inter-coordination of institutions in respect of the implementation of 36 obligations included therein. Sri Lanka has committed to implement the plan for implementation of trade facilitation during the period 2017-2030 thereunder.

Even though countries in the region have fulfilled a higher percentage of the overall commitment, Sri Lanka has only fulfilled about 37.4% of

the total commitment. Taking into consideration the prevailing situation, technical assistance has been requested from the Japan International Coordination Agency with the technical expertise of the International Trade Center to provide independent recommendations enabling the implementation of priority activities on a speedy basis after completion of the assessment of the trade facilitation measures.

Accordingly, “Roadmap for trade facilitation in Sri Lanka” and “Trade Facilitation Action Plan 2025-2028” have been prepared with the participation of about 200 public and private stakeholders.

The Cabinet of Ministers has approved the proposal presented by  the

President to follow the said roadmap and implement the action plan.
