Govt. aiming to provide 100,000 additional foreign jobs this year: State Minister

Colombo, Jan. 30 (Daily Mirror)- Enhancing the access to foreign jobs and cater to a wider range of opportunities, the government was aiming to provide 100,000 additional foreign jobs for Sri Lankan citizens this year, State Minister of Social Empowerment Anupa Pasqual said today.

He said during a press briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on the theme 'Collective Path to a Stable Country' today that recognizing the potential of international opportunities, plans were afoot to send 10,000 individuals proficient in Japanese to secure jobs abroad.

This initiative leverages existing language skills to open doors to lucrative employment options in a new market.

"This ambitious target underscores the commitment to investing in skills development and training programmes, ensuring Sri Lanka's workforce is prepared for the demands of the global market," the State Minister explained.

"Empowering beneficiaries is our ultimate objective, and we're moving beyond simply providing financial assistance to achieve it. Our revamped system focuses on creating opportunities for foreign employment, with 10,000 Japanese Language Proficiency Test passers already placed abroad and a further 100,000 foreign jobs targeted.‚Äù

In addition to equipping beneficiaries with vital professional skills through targeted training programmes, we propose fostering the cultivation of high-value crops like tea, cinnamon, and pepper for export. This dual approach, combining skill development and export-oriented agriculture, promises a sustainable path towards economic empowerment," he added.
