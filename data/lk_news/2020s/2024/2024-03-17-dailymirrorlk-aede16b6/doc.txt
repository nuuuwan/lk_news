Private buses available for election campaigns, no stickers or posters allowed: Gemunu

Colombo, March 17 (Daily Mirror) - Private buses will be provided for election campaigns to any political party but pasting any stickers or posters on the bus will not be allowed, chairman of the Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) Gemunu Wijerathne said.

He told the media that buses will be provided on hire and the candidate or political party that hires the bus for their election campaigns must hold the responsibility of the bus or buses.

Pasting stickers and posters on the body of the bus will damge its paint and the metal, he said.

"Even during previous elections, our buses had been given on hire for election campaigns.

"However, the damages caused to private buses during the aragalaya period have still not been recovered. Many buses were damaged during the aragalaya days.

"Some buses were repaired by their owners, but there are a number of buses still in garages," he said.

Therefore, Wijeratne requested the the Central Bank Governor to look into the matter and take suitable measures to repair those buses and to bring them back to service.
