Sri Lanka Railways asks squatters to register online

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka Railways has asked people living on land own by the Department to register online before July 15, in a move to legitimize them.

“All unauthorized occupants who do not register by that date will be removed from railway premises.”

Users of land owned by the Department and new applicants should register online at http://pms.railway.gov.lk.

Squatters will be leased the land after an assessment, Minister of Transport and Highways and Mass Media Bandula Gunawardena said earlier this year.

The Railways Department owns the largest amount of land in the country.

“I have obtained cabinet approval to have the land and property occupied by squatters for over 10 years assessed, and then sign a lease agreement with them,” Gunawardena had said.

“All squatters who have been there less than 10 years will be prosecuted. Land grabbing now is useless.” Gunawardena was speaking at the inauguration of the Assistant Commercial Superintendent’s office in Nawalapitiya.

“Squatters have to come to this office immediately and file appeals and get the properties assessed; an appeal will be heard on what’s going on. Those who have been there for more than 10 years should verify their identity and pay taxes.”

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has funded a 120-unit apartment complex in Kottawa to relocate squatters living on Railways lands along its Kelani valley line at an estimated cost of 1.3 billion rupees, without taxes.

The relocation project is in line with railway efficiency improvements, which necessitated the removal of squatters residing along the lines from Maharagama to Padukka. (Colombo/Jun19/2024)
