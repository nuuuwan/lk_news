Sri Lanka agriculture minister asks for potato import tax as people skip meals

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has asked for import duties to push potato prices, and control imports despite reports that the poor are skipping meals and selling household goods, and eat less than one meal.

“We have discussed imposing a permanent tax on B-onions and potatoes. This will help stabilise the price. We can remove or reduce the tax in cases of shortage.”

Sri Lanka started to grow potatoes and big onion in Sri Lanka in the 1980s during the time of President J R Jayewardena./

Sri Lanka did the deepest reforms for an open economy in 1977-78, but macro-economists started to print money and the country went into an IMF program within two years as the economy recovered, and more later and the currency started to slide and inflation shot up.

Both potatoes and onions were grown as import substitutes and have received protection for decades.

The call for food taxes come despite large number of people being pushed into poverty after a currency crisis in 2022.

A 10,000 person survey by LirneAsia, a regional policy research organization, found that 33 percent of the respondents had skipped a meal and 47 percent reduced their meal sizes, after the currency crisis hit the country in 2023.

Sri Lanka’s poor surged by 4 million to 31 percent of the population in 2023, the survey found.

About 27 percent of adults restricted their meals to feed children. The survey was conducted from October 10, 2022 to May 12, 2023.

When India banned the export of B-onions the price went to over 700 rupees a kilogram, and farmers cultivated more onions. Now the price has come down to around 100 rupees, Amaraweera said.

“The prices are up because our production costs are high,” he claimed. “We can’t compete with imports. We have to import the seed potatoes too. We are trying to produce seed potatoes here. If we can do that we can become competitive.”

Though some Sri Lanka farmers produce food to feed the people and also export their products, others have for decades produced foods under state protective taxes and got used to high prices above global levels.
