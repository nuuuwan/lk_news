Sri Lanka to revise draft bill on stolen asset recovery

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will revise its draft Proceeds of Crime bill, Health and Media Minister Nalinda Jayatissa said.

The International Monetary Fund had made several observations on the draft bill, which was gazetted in August by the previous government, a cabinet statement said.

The then Justice Minister had appointed a committee headed by a supreme court judge to study these observations.

The committee recommended several provisions be incorporated into the draft bill.

“The bill will include provisions for prohibiting keeping assets earned through crime, profiting from illegal activities, and the seizure of assets earned through crime,” Jayatissa told reporters.

The legal draftsman will now amend the draft bill to include these provisions. (Colombo/Dec10/2024)
