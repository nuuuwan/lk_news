Funds for PC and LG polls to be allocated from 2025 Budget?

The expenditure of the upcoming Presidential Election and General Election must be managed using the Rs. 10 billion allocated in the 2024 Budget, the Cabinet of Ministers has noted.

At the Cabinet meeting on Monday (Feb.05), the ministers took into account the fact that the budgetary allocation made within the financial stamina of the government and the financial provisions have to be managed to cover the expenditures of the two elections.

Further, it was observed that the funds required for conducting Provincial Council and Local Government elections should be released from the 2025 Budget, due to the limited financial situation.

The lawmakers were of the view that, after conducting these two elections in 2025, revisions for the applicable laws should be introduced subject to amendments of the parliament, if required, based on the scheduled recommendations to be presented by the test commission to the parliament declared by the Extraordinary Gazette No.2354/06 dated 16 October 2023, as well as established under Test Commissions Act (Authority 393) No. 17 of 1948.

The Cabinet of Ministers also decided to grant their concurrence to take necessary measures based on the submissions made by the President.
