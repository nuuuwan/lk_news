Nimal prefers solo scene

The guy who created a sensation with the song ‘Ranpota Thelabuwa’ has decided to do his thing as a solo artiste…

Nimal Jayamanne says he quit the band scene in December last year.

“I told the boys to carry on while re-stepping into my solo career, due to personal reasons.”

The singer also worked on a new song, called ‘Mage Pana’, with a video to go with it, as well.

It was, in fact, the song ‘Ranpota Thelabuwa’ that made Nimal a star, literally, overnight.

I remember him performing this particular song at an Island Music Awards show, years ago, and the crowd response was terrific.

Probably we may see a few more big hits come our way from Nimal, now that he has decided to go solo.
