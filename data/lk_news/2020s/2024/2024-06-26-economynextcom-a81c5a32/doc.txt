Sri Lanka leader asks for mandate after bilateral debt deal signed

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s President Ranil Wickremesinghe asked for a mandate to continue his International Monetary Fund-backed economic reforms and questioned the citizens if they will align “with those grappling in the dark”.

President Wickremesinghe’s recorded speech televised all the electronic media comes soon after the island nation declared reaching agreement with $10 billion worth debt restructuring deal in Paris and Beijing.

He reminded the people of the country’s 2022 economic crisis through visuals of queues for fuel and gas as well as power cuts and lack of fertiliser.

He explained the difficult economic reforms done under him in the last two years and criticised his rivals.

Their actions reveal a culture of opportunism, driven solely by ambitions for personal gain and political positioning,” he told his address to the nation.

“While they vie for presidential positions, we remain steadfast in our commitment to the country’s development and progress. Their dreams revolve around titles and accolades; ours are anchored in advancing the nation.”

“The people must determine whether to move forward with me, as I truly comprehend the

challenges facing the country, provide practical solutions, and demonstrate tangible results, or align with groups that have yet to grasp the issues and are blindly seeking power,” the President stated.

He said his rivals and those who are trying to come into power without taking the challenge of facing economic crisis now is strategizing to divide while the government under him was atrategizing to advance the nation.

“They traverse Sri Lanka seeking power, visiting schools and traveling the world in relentless pursuit of authority. Meanwhile, I dedicate my days and nights to serving the country, addressing the needs of our people, and launching economic strengthening programs. I engage globally to garner international support for our nation’s development.”

“Given this context, I pose a crucial question: Will you move forward with me, who comprehended the problem from its inception, offered practical solutions, and delivered results? Or will you align with those grappling in the dark, still struggling to grasp the issues?” he questioned.

“Will you stay the course towards a brighter future for yourself and the nation? Or will you opt for a different path?”

“We are all aware of the perils of veering off course or choosing the wrong path. Therefore, make the right decision. You have the full right and freedom to make that choice.”

“The future does not merely belong to Ranil Wickremesinghe; it pertains to the country, to your future, and the future of our children.”  (Colombo/June 26/2024)
