Sri Lanka local body polls before April festival, provincial within 2025: President

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka plans to hold the once delayed elections for local bodies before the April New Year festival, after bringing a law to cancel nominations, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.

“Even some of the parties that existed at the time nominations were called no longer exists,” President Dissanayake told reporters.

“So we think the (old) nominations should be cancelled and new nominations should be called. We plan to bring the bill cancel nominations to parliament in January.

“There are some problems relating to provincial council elections. So we hope to hold them during next year.”

A so-called ‘delimitation committee’ must be appointed following an amendment to the Provincial Council law in 2017.

Either the amendment must be reversed or the delimitation committee must decide new redraw electoral boundaries.

President Dissanayake said there was no pressure from India to hold provincial elections.

Provncial councils were set up in Sri Lanka with Indian interventions as a way of devolving power to the North and East. (Colombo/Dec21/2024)
