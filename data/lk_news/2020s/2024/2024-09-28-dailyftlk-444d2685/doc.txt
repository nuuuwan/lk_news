Police protection of ex-MPs withdrawn

Sri Lanka Police have announced the withdrawal of security provided to Ministers, Deputy Ministers, State Ministers, and MPs of the 16th Parliament, following the dissolution of Parliament on 24 September.

In an official statement, the Police Media Unit confirmed that officers assigned to the protection of former Ministers, MPs, Governors, Provincial Council Ministers, and Councillors have also been withdrawn.

However, security will continue for Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, and Deputy Speaker Ajith Rajapaksa. This decision follows the standard protocol post-Parliamentary dissolution, ensuring only select officials retain protection during the transition period.
