Students can now enroll in Kotelawala University’s medical degree programme

Colombo, April 09 (Daily Mirror) -  The Cabinet has granted approval for local students to gain admission to the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University's medical degree programme.

Under the endorsed proposal, which received the nod from the Cabinet, aspiring medical students from Sri Lanka will have the opportunity to commence their studies at the renowned institution from the upcoming academic year.

The admission process will be primarily based on the applicants' 'Z score' obtained from the GCE Advanced Level Examination, alongside other pertinent qualifications. However, it's worth noting that admission will be facilitated on a fee-paying basis.
