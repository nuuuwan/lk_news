CEB Spent Over Rs. 130 Mn on Private Lawyers in 2022-2023

COLOMBO (News 1st); Â The Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers' Union has expressed concern over the CEB's rising legal expenses, attributing it to the use of private lawyers against the decisions reached by the country's Cabinet of Ministers.

The CEBEU raised their concerns with Dr. Sulakshana Jayawardena, Secretary of the Ministry overseeing the CEB, in a letter.

The Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union in a letter to the Energy Secretary noted that as per a decision reached by the cabinet, any official within a government institution found to have used public funds to secure the services of private lawyers will be personally responsible for reimbursing the expended amount.

They highlighted that despite the regulations, the board continued to utilize private legal services instead of seeking support from the Attorney General's Department in most cases last year.

According to the CEB Engineers' Union, the CEB spent over 130 million rupees on legal fees in 2022 and 2023 combined.

This figure reportedly exceeds the total legal costs incurred by the board over the six-year period between 2015 and 2021.

In response to these concerns, CEB Chairman N.S. Ilangakoon clarified that the board engaged private lawyers based on decisions made by the Cabinet of Ministers.

He further emphasized that the CEB followed the established procedures mandated for obtaining legal services through presidential directives.
