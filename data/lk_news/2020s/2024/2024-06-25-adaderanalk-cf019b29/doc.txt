Five-member judge bench appointed to hear ex-Navy chief’s writ

The Court of Appeal has decided for the writ petition filed by former Sri Lanka Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda over the alleged abduction of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009, to be taken up for hearing before a five-member judge bench.

The former Navy Chief has filed the relevant petition seeking an order preventing the hearing of a case filed before the Colombo High Court against him and several others, related to the alleged abduction of 11 youths in Colombo and its suburbs in the 2008 and 2009.

Accordingly, the petition will be taken up for hearing before a five-member judge bench comprising Justices Menaka Wijesundera, Sampath B. Abeykoon, Mayadunne Corea and Chamath Morais on September 25, 2024.

The petitioner’s attorney has alleged through this petition that despite the investigations into the case stretching out for 10 years and statements being recorded from over 150 persons, the police had failed to uncover evidence to prove his client guilty of abducting and killing the said 11 youths.
