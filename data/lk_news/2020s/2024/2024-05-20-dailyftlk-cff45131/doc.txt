Sri Lanka celebrates International Tea Day 2024 tomorrow

As the world commemorates International Tea Day on May 21, Ceylon Tea stands proudly at the forefront, celebrating its rich heritage, unparalleled quality, and global significance.

Renowned for its unique flavour profile and exquisite aroma, Ceylon Tea has captivated tea enthusiasts worldwide for generations. Originating from the lush hillsides of Sri Lanka, this beloved brew continues to enchant connoisseurs and novices alike, embodying a tradition of excellence that spans centuries.

International Tea Day serves as a poignant reminder of the profound cultural and economic impact of tea on societies across the globe. From cherished moments of relaxation to bustling tea auctions, tea plays an integral role in fostering connections and enriching lives.

Amidst the festivities, Ceylon Tea producers reaffirm their commitment to sustainability, community empowerment, and environmental stewardship. Through responsible cultivation practices and ethical sourcing initiatives, they strive to preserve the natural beauty of Sri Lanka’s tea-growing regions while empowering local communities and supporting livelihoods.

This year’s focus will shine a spotlight on women in the tea sector, highlighting their rich and diverse contributions across the supply chain from crop to cup.

Tea farming appeals to many smallholders, particularly women in developing countries, as it creates employment and generates year-round income. The event will also include tea tasting from different countries according to Sri Lanka Tea Board Chairman Niraj de Mel.
