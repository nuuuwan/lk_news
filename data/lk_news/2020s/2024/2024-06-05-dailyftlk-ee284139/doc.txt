Team Sweden celebrates 75 years of Sri Lanka-Sweden diplomatic relations by bringing a high-level delegation of Swedish companies to Sri Lanka from 5-7 June, in connection with Sweden’s National Day celebrations on 6 June and an Energy Seminar on 7 June.

With the Sri Lankan economy set to rebound this year, Team Sweden in Sri Lanka including the Embassy of Sweden, Honorary Consulate of Sweden in Sri Lanka and Business Sweden, in collaboration with Sweden-Sri Lanka Business Council (SSLBC) have set an ambition to define and launch Sweden-Sri Lanka Collaboration Program, which includes various initiatives and activities to promote economic and trade collaboration between the two countries.

Ambassador of Sweden to Sri Lanka Jan Thesleff said: “Sri Lanka is a high priority partner for Sweden, and Sweden remains committed towards supporting the local economy by sharing solutions, expertise and knowledge within targeted high-relevance sectors.”

“The participating companies in this delegation offer Swedish knowledge which will further strengthen Sri Lanka’s green and digital transition. I am certain this visit will present multiple co-operation opportunities,” he added.

The delegation will engage in workshops and meetings with key Ministers and ministries – the Ministry of Trade, Commerce and Food Security, the Ministry for Power and Energy, and the Ministry of Technology; meetings with leading industrial conglomerates – Aitken Spence and Hayleys; B2B workshops with key associations including Sri Lanka Associations of Software and Service Companies and European Chamber of Commerce in Sri Lanka and site visits, along with a seminar and a high- level networking reception to commemorate 75 years of diplomatic relations. There will be a seminar on “Nordic-Baltic Power Transmission Grid and Nordic experiences for Sri Lanka Power Transmission Link” on 7 June from 12 noon to 1:30 p.m. at Stables Park Street, Colombo 3.

The aim for the delegation is to identify relevant trade and economic opportunities; and to identify and initiate discussions with key stakeholders, fostering future collaboration opportunities.  “Sri Lanka, strategically located in the Indian Ocean and providing a gateway to South Asia, has a growing consumer market. Its trade agreement with the European Union (EU) and investment incentives including tax and duty exemptions make for fertile ground for Swedish companies to benefit from.  This, coupled with the investment by the government on developing infrastructure, puts the country in good stead,” said Trade and Invest Commissioner of Sweden to India and Head - Business Sweden, South Asia Cecilia Oskarsson.

The reported total trade between both countries was close to $ 150 million in 2022 and, the companies that form this delegation, engaged mainly in Information Technology, telecom, and energy, hold a promise of a bright, new future together.
