Bribery allegations filed against AKD

A complaint has been filed against the Presidential hopeful of the National People’s Power (NPP) Anura Kumara Dissanayake with the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption regarding the ownership of a house.

The complaint made by Civil Society Activist Darshana Thanthirige alleges that Dissanayake was allocated a house in the Madiwela Housing Scheme despite owning a residential property in Kadawatha.

Thanthirige claims that as per the established regulations, MPs should not be assigned a house from the Madiwela Housing Scheme if they own a residence within 25 kilometres of the Parliament.

He alleges that Dissanayake’s Kadawatha property is within the 25 kilometre limit and is calling for a thorough investigation into the issue.

According to the assets declaration filed with the Bribery Commission, the property in Ranmuthugala, Kadawatha, is registered under Dissanayake’s wife’s name.
