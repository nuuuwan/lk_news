Commission appointed to propose electoral reforms given more time

President Ranil Wickremesinghe has taken steps to extend the time given to the nine-member Commission of Inquiry appointed to prepare proposals for electoral reforms, to submit its final report.

The Commission of Inquiry headed by former Chief Justice Priyasad Dep was appointed by the President in October last year through a special gazette notification issued by the President.

The commission had been tasked with making recommendations to amend election laws to suit current societal needs by conforming with principles of good governance and strengthening representative democracy and also to restore trust and accountability by strengthening the legal framework for registration and operation of political parties.

The relevant commission had been instructed to make recommendations on many related matters including increasing the representation of women and youth, reducing the time period from the day the election is announced to the day the election is held and the results are released, providing the opportunity to vote by using modern technology in voting and making the necessary arrangements for Sri Lankans living abroad to cast their votes.

The commission had previously been instructed to submit the relevant recommendations before 15th of April 2024, however steps have been taken to extend the period by another 02 months.

Accordingly, it is reported that President Ranil Wickramasinghe has taken steps to give the commission time until June 15 to submit the relevant final report.
