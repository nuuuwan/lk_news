COPF summons Public Security Secretary and Immigration CG

The Committee on Public Finance (COPF) has summoned the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security and the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration for an inquiry tomorrow (08), says the Chairman of COPF MP Harsha de Silva.

In a post on ‘X’ (formerly Twitter), he said the COPF summoned the Secretary to Ministry of Public Security along with the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration tomorrow for a “balanced inquiry into the ongoing visa fiasco”.

“While it is customary for all public finance-related legislation be routed through COPF, this strangely was not,” the committee chairman further said.
