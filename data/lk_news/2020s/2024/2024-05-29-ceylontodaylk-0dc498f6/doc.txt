Onmax DT directors ordered to submit depositor details to FCID

Colombo Chief Magistrate Thilina Gamage ordered the five accused directors involved in the Onmax DT financial fraud case to immediately submit a comprehensive report detailing all the depositors and their respective deposits, to the Financial Crimes Investigation Division of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).

The Magistrate also directed the CID to provide a report to the Court on the number of depositors and the amount each has invested in the institution. Additionally, the Court instructed the CID to collaborate with the Central Bank to develop a plan for repaying the affected depositors and submit this plan to the Court.

Warrants have been issued for the arrest of three defendants who are currently absconding. During the proceedings, the Court considered the arguments presented by the lawyers for both the aggrieved parties and the suspects.

Anuja Premaratne, PC, representing the Respondents, informed the Court that 244,689 individuals had deposited money with the institution, and USD 83 million had already been repaid to them. However, there are still 61,206 depositors awaiting payments totalling USD 18 million. He requested the Court to lift the Prohibitory Order on the institution’s assets, as the current restrictions hinder the repayment process.

Premaratne, PC further suggested that if the institution could operate under Central Bank supervision, it would be able to repay all the depositors within the next two years. However, the Magistrate rejected this request.

The CID submitted an additional report on the case, and Senior State Counsel Oswald Perera, representing the aggrieved parties, stated that further investigations are ongoing. He noted that despite the Central Bank’s ban on the institution, they continued to accept deposits from the public. The investigation is focused on identifying all the depositors and assessing the institution’s assets, including 31 lands.

A group of lawyers, including Namal Rajapaksa, Deshan Wimalaratne and R.A.D. Ranawaka, made representations on behalf of the aggrieved parties. The five defendants, Indika Sampath, Gayeshan Abeyratne, Samith Sandaruwan, Indika Jayasekara and Dhananjaya Gayan, appeared in Court. A large number of defrauded depositors were also present both inside and outside the courtroom.
