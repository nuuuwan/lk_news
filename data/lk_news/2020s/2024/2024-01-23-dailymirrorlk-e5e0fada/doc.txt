Circular revoked; doctors call off planned strike

Colombo, Jan 23 (Daily Mirror) - The strike action by government doctors scheduled for tomorrow morning over the suspension of the increment to the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance has been called off.

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) in a statement said the Director General of Health Services has issued a written notification, revoking the recent suspension of the DAT allowance for doctors, which was included in the January salary.

This decision, effective immediately, comes after the initial directive to temporarily halt the payment.

In addition, health institution heads have been instructed to disburse the relevant allowance for January through a special voucher for doctors not covered by the regular payroll.

The DAT allowance, which was raised from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000 was suspended this morning in accordance with the Treasury's directive.
