Maldives overtakes UK as second largest tourist source amid VFS Global visa controversy

ECONOMYNEXT – The Maldives became the second largest source of tourists to Sri Lanka in May amid concerns that a bilateral visa exemption deal may be in violated after VFS Global, a private outsourcing contractor started charging fees.

In the first 30 days of May Sri Lanka has welcomed 108,656 tourists up 30 percent from 83,309 a year earlier but down from 148,867 in April.

A controversial deal with VFS Global which led foreigners and outsourced workers manning immigration point at the main airport, also resulted in a user-unfriendly website, as well as visas rising to 107 dollars from 51.

Though a fight back by Tourism Minister Harin Fernando against the deal led to a 50-dollar visa being re-introduced, the problems with a user-unfriendly website compared to the earlier easy-to-us one remain, with complaints continuing in online forums.

A controversy has also blown up between Sri Lanka and Maldives after VFS Global started charging fees from Maldives visitors.

Sri Lanka has a reciprocal visa exemption arrangement with the Maldives and there are fears that VFS style fees may be slapped on Sri Lankans who may also face the hassle of getting VFS-style visa.

At the moment Maldives only requires online disembarkation information to be filled when a Sri Lankan visits.

“Following the announcement of a new e-visa system in Sri Lanka, the Ministry has been engaged in discussions with Sri Lankan counterparts to ensure a smooth transition for Maldivian travellers,” Maldives’ Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

“For those Maldivians who are already in Sri Lanka and require a visa extension may contact the Maldives High Commission in Colombo.”

“The Ministry is committed to establishing a visa process that reflects the current visa agreement between the Maldives and Sri Lanka and ensures reciprocity for Maldivian travellers.

“Discussions with Sri Lankan authorities are ongoing to address any remaining concerns.”

Amid the controversy over VFS charges, Maldives was listed as the second largest source of tourists to Sri Lanka in the first 30 days of May with 7,984 tourists, overtaking British visitors at 7,844.

Sri Lanka’s tourism promotion authorities also revised up April numbers saying it was to reflect new visa categories introduced within the month, without giving details.
