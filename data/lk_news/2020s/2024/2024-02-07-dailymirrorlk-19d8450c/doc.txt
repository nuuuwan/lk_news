Motion filed challenging registration of NPP as political party

Colombo, Feb 07 (Daily Mirror) -Â  A motion has been filed at the Supreme Court challenging the registration of the National People's Power (NPP) as a political party by the National Election Commission.

The motion, submitted by activist and Secretary of the Vinivida Foundation, Attorney-at-Law Nagananda Kodituwakku, targets the recent registration of the NPP, led by MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

Kodituwakku's motion comes amid ongoing controversy surrounding the registration process and the NPP's status as an independent political entity. The motion was filed during the consideration of a writ petition lodged against the Election Commission's decision to reject the registration of the Vinivida Foundation as a political party.

In his petition, Kodituwakku argues that the registration of the NPP violates Sri Lankan law, as the party was formerly part of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), which is already a registered political entity. He contends that the NPP's registration as a separate party constitutes a breach of legal statutes governing political party registration.

Kodituwakku asserts that granting separate political party status to the NPP, which was previously a component of the JVP, contravenes existing laws regulating political party registration. He calls upon the Supreme Court to grant him an opportunity to present compelling evidence supporting his motion.
