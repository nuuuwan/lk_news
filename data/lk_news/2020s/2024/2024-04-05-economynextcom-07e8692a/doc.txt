ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Jeevan Thondaman has been chosen as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum, a ministry statement said.

“He worked relentlessly to create a conducive environment for plantation workers, ensuring fair wages, safe working conditions and adequate benefits,” the World Economic Forum said on its website.

“As Minister for Water Supply, he has been spearheading ambitious reforms in the water sector to increase access to safe and affordable drinking water, create a climate resilience roadmap for water services and a transparent pricing formula that protects the most vulnerable in society.”
