Pan Asia Bank and Odiliya forge strategic partnership to revolutionize real estate financing

Pan Asia Bank, ‘The Truly Sri Lankan Bank,’ has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Odiliya, a prominent name in real estate and property development. This strategic partnership is designed to redefine real estate financing in Sri Lanka by offering customers innovative and flexible financing solutions for property investments.

A standout feature of this partnership is the value proposition tied to Odiliya Group’s latest housing project in Kadawatha. Customers can secure their dream homes with a 25% down payment and benefit from a one-year grace period during which no payments are required. This unique offering provides homebuyers with the opportunity to not make any payments till they move into their new homes, making the dream of homeownership more attainable. In addition to this exciting project in Kadawatha, Odiliya has several other developments across the country offering similar attractive financing options through Pan Asia Housing loans, further expanding opportunities for prospective homeowners.
