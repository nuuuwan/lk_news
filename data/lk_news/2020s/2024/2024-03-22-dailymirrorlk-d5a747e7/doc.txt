Ugandaâ€™s president appoints son as military chief

KAMPALA, March 22 (Reuters) - Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni has appointed his son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, as head of the military, the defence ministry said on Friday.

Muhoozi Kainerugaba, 48, a general in the military, is widely seen as his father's successor in waiting and once stirred controversy by threatening to invade neighbouring Kenya. The ministry said in a statement he replaces Wilson Mbasu Mbadi, who was removed and appointed as a junior minister.

In 2022, Museveni removed his son as commander of Uganda's land forces after he made threats to invade neighbouring Kenya in posts on social media platform X.

In the posts, Kainerugaba also expressed support for Russia's President Vladimir Putin saying: "The majority of mankind (that are non-white) support Russia's stand in Ukraine."

Kainerugaba has long been viewed as being prepared to take over the presidency from his father, 79, who has ruled the east African country for nearly 40 years.
