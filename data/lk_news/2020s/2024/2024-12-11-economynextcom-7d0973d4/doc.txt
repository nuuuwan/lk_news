Sri Lanka’s SEC renews Jaffna University partnership to create market professionals

ECONOMYNEXT – The Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka has renewed its agreement with the University of Jaffna to develop the next generation of capital market professionals.

The partnership with the university began in 2009, bridging academia and the capital markets industry, and ensuring undergraduates benefit from a platform for academic and professional growth.

The latest renewal reinforces this collaboration, “ensuring undergraduates continue to benefit from a robust platform for academic and professional growth,” the SEC said in a statement.

“Through initiatives like these, the SEC aims to inspire a new generation of forward-thinking professionals, fostering academic excellence and driving innovation in Sri Lanka’s capital market.”

The new MoU offers several benefits to undergraduates, including academic recognitions such as gold medals and cash awards for excellence in capital market-related subjects, opportunities for research grants in the field, and enhanced industry exposure through internships and hands-on learning experiences facilitated by the SEC.

The revised MoU was formally signed with the participation of key representatives from the University and the SEC.

The SEC said it was expanding partnerships with other national universities, and is dedicated to creating professional opportunities for students across the country. (Colombo/Dec11/2024)
