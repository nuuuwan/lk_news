31 Sri Lanka firms get AEO Tier 1 for fast customs clearance

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka Customs has included 31 companies into a ‘Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) Tier I status, qualifying them for faster goods clearance with reduced documentation, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce said.

The firms were awarded the status at a ceremony on July 30 by State Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya.

The AEO Tier I status is aligned with World Customs Organization (WCO) SAFE Framework of Standards and the World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement.

Companies elevated to the category are entitled to “enhanced trade facilitation measures, such as rapid release of goods, reduced documentation and data requirements, and fewer physical inspections,” helping cross-border trade, the CCC said.

To qualify for AEO status, operators must meet the eligibility criteria set by Sri Lanka Customs. This includes demonstrating high legal and operational compliance and maintaining robust supply chain security.

The Chamber facilitated and coordinated the training programme which was conducted for selected private sector companies, funded by the United States Agency for International Development’s (USAID) Partnership for Accelerating Results in Trade, National Expenditure and Revenue (PARTNER) Activity.

Due to high private sector interest in pursuing AEO certification, the Ceylon Chamber plans to facilitate additional training programmes, contributing to continually enhancing trade processes and facilitation. (Colombo/Aug1/2024)
