ILT20 slaps one-year ban on Noor Ahmad

Feb. 20 (cricbuzz) - Afghanistan leg-spinner Noor Ahmad has been banned for 12 months by ILT20's disciplinary committee for breach of contract with his franchise Sharjah Warriors. Noor becomes the second player after fellow countryman Naveen-ul-Haq to be banned by the ILT20 for the same reason.

The 19-year-old, who was retained by the Warriors, opted against signing the retention notice and instead to ply his trade in the SA20 tournament where he represented Durban Supergiants. Noor's refusal to sign the player agreement contract forced the Warriors to approach the ILT20 for further action on the matter. The disciplinary committee held separate hearings for the player and the franchise before coming to a final decision.

Initially Noor was meted out a 20-month ban, like Naveen-ul-Haq, but given that the former was a minor ahead of the first ILT20 season, the punishment was trimmed down to 12 months.
