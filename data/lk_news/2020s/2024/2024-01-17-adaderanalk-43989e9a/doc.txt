Court approval required for transfer of ‘Harak Kata’, Appeals Court informs CID

The Court of Appeals on Wednesday (17 Jan.) informed the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) that if notorious underworld figure Nadun Chinthaka Wickramaratne, alias ‘Harak Kata’, is to be transferred from his current site of detention, it must be done with the approval of the courts.

Accordingly, the Court informed the CID that consent must first be obtained from both, the Appellate Court and the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court, prior to any such transfer.

The relevant order was issued by Appellate Court Judge D. N. Samarakoon, when a petition filed by the underworld kingpin’s father, Nelson Wickramaratne, was taken up in court.

The petition was filed seeking a court order preventing the further extension of the current detention order imposed against ‘Harak Kata’, and is due to be recalled in court on 30 January.
