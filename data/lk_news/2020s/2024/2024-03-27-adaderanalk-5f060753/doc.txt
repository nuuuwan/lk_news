President Ranil Wickremesinghe says Sri Lanka stands out as the sole nation in Asia where democracy is fully safeguarded, ensuring that governmental actions do not impede the operations of the opposition.

He also underscored the significance of safeguarding the democratic parliamentary system, ensuring that everyone’s viewpoints are allowed to be heard.

The president delivered these remarks while speaking at the opening session of Sri Lanka’s inaugural National Student Parliament, convened on Tuesday (26) at the Presidential Secretariat.

The book titled ‘Pibidunu Sisu Mathi Sabaya,’ which chronicles the program offering school students the chance to visit notable locations in Colombo, including the President’s Office, conceived under the initiative of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, was presented to the President by Major Nadika Dangolla, Assistant Director of the Presidential Secretariat. Additionally, to commemorate this event, Mrs. Wasantha Perera, Secretary of the Ministry of Education, presented a special gift to President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

The President extended an invitation to the National Student Parliamentarians to share their viewpoints and recommendations regarding the nation’s political landscape. Additionally, he granted them the chance to visit the Cabinet meeting venue at the Presidential Secretariat.
