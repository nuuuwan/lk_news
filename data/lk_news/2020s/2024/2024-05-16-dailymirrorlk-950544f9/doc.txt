RW declines, Sajith yet to respond, AKD says yes

Colombo, May 16 - President Ranil Wickremesinghe informed the Daily Mirror that he is not in a position to participate in the live political debate organized by Daily Mirror and Lankadeepa between the political party leaders when an invitation was extended to him today.

“I am engaged in debates in Parliament. If anyone wants to have debates with me they can join me in Parliament,” the President said.

The Daily Mirror extended invitations to main presidential candidates Ranil Wickremesinghe, National Peoples Power Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake and Leader of Opposition Sajith Premadasa for a live debate on their parties economic and political policies and their pledges in moving the country forward if they win the presidential election scheduled to be held this year.

SJB Leader Sajith Premadasa has still not responded to the invitation while NPP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake has accepted to debate.

The debate will be aired live on Daily Mirror, Lankadeepa, and Sunday Times digital platforms.
