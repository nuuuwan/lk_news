Govt. to recall politically appointed Ambassadors and High Commissioners

The Government yesterday announced plans to recall Ambassadors and High Commissioners who were appointed based on political allegiances.

Speaking at the post-Cabinet meeting press conference, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Vijitha Herath states that a detailed report is being prepared to review these appointments and that political appointees will be recalled accordingly.

“Many daughters and sons of Members of the Parliament have been given diplomatic appointments,” he said, highlighting the extent of political influence in recent diplomatic placements.

The move was seen as part of the new Government’s effort to address political favouritism in Foreign Service appointments, aiming for a more merit-based diplomatic corps moving forward.

However, Herath clarified that no Sri Lankan diplomats would be recalled immediately, as several key international conferences and summits including the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) are ongoing.

“Diplomatic changes will occur after these commitments have been fulfilled in a gradual manner,” the Cabinet Spokesman assured.
