Presidency; spending and elections; Harin’s proclamation

The ever-present topic since Ranasinghe Premadasa was assassinated has cropped up again: the abolition of the executive presidency.  JRJ and Premadasa Snr, sat comfortably and all powerful on the Seat of the President, created by the former and charmed with smoky incense by the latter. Sat they did, all powerfully and comfortingly, at least JRJ did.

Prez Premadasa was uncomfortable at times when likely contenders who seemed to be popular with the voting masses appeared within eyesight. Some were even not likely candidates in a presidential election and eyeing his seat. But he knew how to deal with them.  Then came CBK who promised to do away with the post and return power to the Prime Minister and Parliament. That was while campaigning. Once she was voted to occupy the seat, she enjoyed its comfort too much and savoured the power it gave her and she forgot her election promise.

About President Mahinda Rajapaksa I only remember he wanted to extend his sitting on that seat for a third round. Now that his and his heir’s hopes are dashed, he wants the post eliminated. Very much the case with Maithripala Sirisena. When the Most Ven Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera was alive and helped him to climb to that exalted seat and while getting used to it, he said he would definitely cancel out that post and he would gladly step down.

The Thera gone and his powers showing up, he changed his tune, rather, he did not touch on the presidency but changed his Prime Minister at his whim and fancy. Now he is again on the bandwagon shouting ‘No Executive President’ since he is completely out. Prez Gotabaya voiced the resolution, Cass believes, but his brilliant advisors, many of them Profs in academia and agriculture, got him to sit tight and advised him on other matters and decisions to be made, resulting in the downward crash of the country.

Ranil W was rather low key on the abolition of the presidency because after all his uncle brought it on and he, the nephew, thought it his family right to one day succeed him and enjoy the perks, mainly travel abroad in true VVIP style.  The JVP of course has now proved itself to be using doublespeak lingua. It almost brought the country to an ignominious standstill and now with the glimmer of hope for AKD gathering greater illumination like the increase of crowds congregating to listen to his pearls of wisdom falling from his mouth, he and his coalition of parties is silent on this, just as they are not even whimpering and stuttering protests against ECTA and more cooperation with India.

So many intellectuals, distinguished lawyers, sensible politicians, vast majority of the public very earnestly opine that for Sri Lanka to progress democratically this all-powerful post must be evaporated – Cass supposes by a change in the Constitution. Cass and the women she writes on behalf of, hope sincerely these sensible, loyal to the country people will succeed in bringing about this change.

Each sitting of Parliament; the 4th Feb parade; the President’s sojourns overseas, for necessary reasons and otherwise; the contingency he takes with him cost so very much. They could be severely pruned, much to the approval of all voters. But no, those and other expenses go on as if we are a rich, first world nation.  And now a news item that the amount allocated for elections has been halved and elections are in dire danger of being kaput – not held.

What on earth is the matter with those who rule us? We are a democratic nation, not an autocracy, so elections have to be held. Two were not held on time. Now, the all-important presidential and general election must be held. Just because some who tasted power and the open sesame to enrichment shiver like leaves in the wind of misfortune or apala kaala, they are striving hard to not have to face the votes of the public.

When Cass heard Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando spouting out that assets or assets made to be financial burdens by mismanagement of the likes of our airports, Katunayake included, and our ports or parts thereof, as managed by India and likely to belong to India, she wondered whether he said it as his brand of humour, tongue-in-cheek or with cynicism. He made the astounding announcement with a grin on his face. Cass just could not believe her ears. Then she surmised, since she heard it as a video clip, that there was one bit of evidence to be justifiably curbed by the On-line Safety Act now passed into law, as is reported, ignoring changes et al advocated by the ruling of the Supreme Court.

What she means is that false stories and garbled news posted on social media deceive people. Nothing said in that day’s news telecast on the TV Channel Cass listens to. The next day pronouncement of Harin’s was debated in Parliament. Harin’s friend-Minister who along with him absconded to the SLPP-UNP government deserting the SJB for ministerships, defended him, but weakly.

The public have risen in perturbation as is evidenced by just one letter to the Editor in The Island of Wednesday 21 February, titled Harin batting for India.  I quote “He (Harin) has added that Sri Lanka is part of India! Has he lost his senses?” Very apt, pertinent question. Apparently Harin Fernando, Minister of Tourism, has lost his sense of geography, geopolitics; marbles in short.

We need to be grateful to Guwan Seeya, the writer of the letter, for being so knowledgably and succinctly drawing the attention of readers of the said paper and others to the blasphemy that this Minister has proclaimed. At the end of his long letter Guwan Seeya comments: “Meanwhile, the silence of the Aviation Minister is deafening.” Either this Minister too has lost his wits or is standing for ‘our side’ whatever comes or is said.
