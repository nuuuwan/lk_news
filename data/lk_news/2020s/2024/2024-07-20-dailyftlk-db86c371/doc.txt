Coin Ceylon, in collaboration with Intersect MBO, has marked a significant milestone in the blockchain landscape by launching the first Intersect Community Hub in South Asia, here in Sri Lanka.

This landmark event, held at the Royal Colombo Golf Club, united blockchain enthusiasts, developers, diplomats, and industry leaders, all committed to promoting innovation, collaboration, and governance within the Cardano ecosystem.

Coin Ceylon has been a pioneering force in Sri Lanka’s blockchain sector. The company was instrumental in launching the nation’s first Cardano Stake Pool, establishing the first Blockchain Forum, creating Sri Lanka’s inaugural multi-purpose Cardano Yakka CNFT collection alongside many other blockchain events and meet-ups, and conducting education initiatives to promote how to use blockchain technologies in an effective an ethical manner. These initiatives highlight Coin Ceylon’s dedication to advancing blockchain technology and fostering a vibrant local community.

Intersect, a member-based organisation, is dedicated to ensuring the sustainability and future development of the Cardano ecosystem. By rallying members around a shared vision, Intersect promotes a more resilient, secure, transparent, and innovative Cardano network. Members are empowered to guide Cardano’s strategic direction through active participation in steering groups, committees, and advisory boards.

The newly established Coin Ceylon x Intersect Sri Lanka Hub aims to serve as a comprehensive platform for education, networking, and collaboration. The hub will regularly host meet-ups, workshops, town halls, and networking events, engaging the community and enhancing their understanding of blockchain technology. Local developers, entrepreneurs, and enthusiasts will have access to valuable resources, mentorship, and opportunities to participate in global blockchain initiatives.

A key role of the hub will be promoting on-chain governance and contributing to the Cardano Constitution. This involves organising workshops and facilitating community feedback to shape Cardano’s governance, ensuring a democratic and inclusive decision-making process within the blockchain community.

Hub members benefit from participating in decision-making processes that influence Cardano’s strategic direction, accessing grants and work packages for developing Cardano’s codebase, collaborating with a diverse network of professionals dedicated to advancing the ecosystem, and showcasing their contributions through member events, developer conferences, marketing initiatives, and periodic report highlights.

In addition to these benefits, joining the Coin Ceylon x Intersect Hub in Sri Lanka offers localised content and support, exclusive access to events and workshops, networking opportunities, discounted rates for conferences and seminars, community engagement and volunteering opportunities, mentorship and advisory services, business and start-up support, targeted marketing and promotion, academic and research collaboration, cultural and recreational activities, early access to resources and programs, and recognition for contributions to the local blockchain community.

This initiative has garnered significant interest from academics, business leaders, and university students, marking a new era for blockchain development in Sri Lanka.

Coin Ceylon and Intersect are excited to revolutionise the blockchain landscape in Sri Lanka and beyond, empowering communities and driving global change through innovative blockchain solutions.
