Sri Lanka central bank net foreign reserves negative by US$728mn in July

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank’s negative foreign reserve position had undergone a steep correction since 2022 as domestic credit slowed, but its net foreign assets were still a negative 728 million US dollars by July 2024, official data showed.

In mid 2022, after borrowing from swaps and running arrears to the Asian Clearing Union via the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank’s net foreign assets was a negative 4.6 billion US dollars.

Since then the central bank ran deflationary policy, collected reserves by selling its domestic securities portfolio to banks to pre-empt private credit and built reserves.

The reserves were used to settle swaps to Bangladesh, loans to the International Monetary Fund taken during previous flexible inflation targeting driven currency crises and from late 2023 to also settle the Reserve Bank of India.

By June 2022, negative foreign assets were down to a negative 774 million US dollar equivalent.

The 4.6 billion dollar negative position led to large losses for the central bank as the currency collapsed due to a surrender rule scuttling an attempt to float.

A reserve collecting central bank that maintains foreign reserves to match its domestic reserve money (100 percent of reserves), at an appropriate interest rate, fixes the exchange rate, maintains monetary stability, prevents depreciation and avoids social unrest.

Sri Lanka’s reserve money is now the equivalent of about 5 billion US dollars, but foreign assets backing the local money are still negative by 15 percent of the monetary base.

Before central bank swaps macro-economists hiked rates as reserves fell to low levels.

However central bank swaps have allowed macroeconomists to mis-target rates till reserves turn negative.

The greater the willingness of foreign central banks to give swaps (and use them) allows the greater the incentive for macroeconomists to cut rates disregarding the balance of payments, critics say.

Central banks can also create money, suppress the call money rate and get into more debt by getting into money generating swaps with local banks, and show foreign reserves which have not been bought outright, as Lebanon’s central bank borrowed from local banks through a different mechanism.

Fortunately, a swap from China, which helped show a higher gross reserve level, could not be used by macroeconomists to fund private imports by sterilizing interventions to keep a fixed policy rate.

In Sri Lanka and in other troubled countries, rates are now is-targeted based on a claim that inflation is low (data driven monetary policy) and money is printed to target the average weighted call money rate through open market operations.

Rates were also mis-targeted after the end of a war claiming that there was a ‘potential output gap that could be bridged by inflationary open market operations.

Rates were also mis-targeted under the claims that ‘fiscal policy is tight, therefore monetary policy must be loose’ when politicians hiked taxes to reduce the deficit and fuel was market priced.

In June the rupee came under pressure, after excess liquidity was allowed to build up from unsterilized dollar purchases. In order to collect reserves and balance domestic credit however dollar purchases have to be sterilized.

Sri Lanka’s private credit is now recovering. Since the end of a civil war in 2009, Sri Lanka has cut rates as private credit recovered and enforced them with inflationary open market operations, triggering balance of payments deficits.

Analysts have warned that ‘data driven monetary policy’ involving Anglophone statistical doctrines of historical 12 months inflation, rejects laws of nature and monetary rules for reserve collecting note issue banks discovered by classical economists which kept the age of inflation at bay.
