Sri Lanka tourist arrivals up 102-pct in Feb led by Russia

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s tourist arrivals grew 102.3 percent from a year ago to 218,350 in February 2024, led by Russia as the sector continued to recover from an economic crisis that scared away tourists in 2022.

Russian arrivals were 32,030 just overtaking India at 30,027.  UK was 20,614, Germany 16,259 and China came in fifth place at 14,836.

The high visitor numbers from Russia were seen as the Department of Immigration said it was cancelling extended visas of  Russians and Ukrainians following a criticism of a party on racist lines where only ‘white’ people were allowed.

There have been criticism that Russians were running businesses, but it is not known to what extent they were helping boost an eco-system of services or promotions that were helping bring visitors.

The February numbers are close to levels seen before the coronavirus pandemic.

Sri Lanka tourist arrivals were 252,000 in 2019, before the Coronavirus pandemic. Sri Lanka managed to host 207,000 just as the virus began to spread and travel restrictions and lockdowns began.

Sri Lanka was hit by a currency crisis as the country emerged from the pandemic.

In 2022, as other countries including the Maldives – which has a regime where macroeconomists have less room to destroy – recovered, Sri Lanka was hit by forex and energy shortages, after two years of money printed to target ‘potential output.’ (Colombo/Mar04/2024)
