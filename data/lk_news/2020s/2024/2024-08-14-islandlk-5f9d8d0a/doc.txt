NDB posts strong profitability in first half of 2024 – PBT crosses Rs. 6.5 Bn

National Development Bank PLC continued to demonstrate strategic agility and resilience amidst less than conducive operating conditions, as was reflected in financial performance for the six months ended 30 June 2024, released to the Colombo Stock Exchange recently. The Bank posted a pre-tax profit of Rs. 6.5 Bn for the period under review, an impressive growth of 58%, predominantly driven by healthy net interest income.

NDB’s Director/ Chief Executive Officer Kelum Edirisinghe attributed such performance to alignment to the Bank’s current mid-term strategy, delivered by the passionate and dedicated NDB team. ‘Our strategy is one which has been curated pivoting around three core focus areas viz. optimising cost of funds, enhancing fee based income through transaction banking and enhancing portfolio quality. This strategy will enable us to drive profitability and enhance shareholder value, helping the Bank reach and exceed its true potential. We are encouraged by the recent affirmation of the Bank’s credit rating at A-(lka) by Fitch Ratings Lanka Limited. As the operating environment continues to stabilise, we remain well-disposed in supporting our clientele and the wider economy with our full suite of financial and advisory solutions, he further commented.

The Bank recorded a total banking revenue of Rs. 22.9 Bn for the period under review, a solid growth of 24% over the comparative period in 2023 (YoY). Net interest income posted a healthy 10% growth to Rs. 16.5 Bn, commendable in the low interest rate environment that prevailed through the period. The decline in the Bank’s interest income was more than offset by the reduction in interest expenses, on account of faster repricing of the deposits book. Net interest margin (NIM) reached an all-time high of 4.26% a growth of 29 bps over the end 2023 position affirming the effectiveness of the Bank’s strategy.

Net fee and commission income for the period was Rs. 3.4 Bn which normalised over a relatively high base in 2023, as reflected in an 8% YoY decline. Other non-fund based income categories all performed well netting a gain of Rs. 3.9 Bn, save and except for those classified as Other Operating Income, which recorded a loss of Rs. 779 Mn on foreign revaluation reserves – attributable to the appreciation of the Sri Lankan Rupee.
