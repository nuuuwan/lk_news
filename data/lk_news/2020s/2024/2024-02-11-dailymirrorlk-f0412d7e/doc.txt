Sri Lanka cannot depend on other nations for ever: Ruwan

Gampaha, Feb 11 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka cannot depend on other countries every day and it is high time the nation stands up on its own with pride, UNP Deputy Leader Ruwan Wijewardene said over the weekend.

"Sri Lanka cannot borrow from other nations everyday and follow their instructions. It is high time the nation stands up by itself. President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the government are striving to see that Sri Lanka achieves this status," Wijewardene told the UNP Gampaha District convention.

"The time has come for the people of Sri Lanka to make the right decision on behalf of their nation," he added.

"This is an election year. We may have to face a Presidential election in October, and it will be followed by the general election while Provincial Council elections will also be held. It is the people who should decide the course of the nation. People should make the right decisions. The country has been put on the right track.Â  President Wickremesinghe had stabilized the nation. Imagine what concessions the people of this country could enjoy if he rules this country for five more years," he added.
