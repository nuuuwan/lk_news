‘Club Wasantha’ murder: Tattoo studio owner requests confidential statement, court orders enhanced prison security for suspects

The tattoo studio owner Surendra Wasantha Perera, who was arrested in connection with the shooting incident in Athurugiriya, which claimed the lives of businessman Surendra Wasantha Perera alias ‘Club Wasantha’ and another person, has requested permission to make a confidential statement to the Kaduwela Magistrate.

The suspect has made this request when the seven suspects arrested in relation to the incident were produced before the court on Wednesday (10).

However, the Kaduwela Magistrate has advised the suspect in question to rethink the decision and make the request again during an upcoming court date.

Meanwhile, the police requested the court for permission to detain the seven suspects for 48 hours for further interrogations.

The Kaduwela Magistrate, who rejected the request, ordered the suspects to be remanded in custody until July 22.

Furthermore, the magistrate ordered the prison officers to provide additional security to the suspects, since there are accomplices of the criminal figure infamously known as “Loku Patee,” who is suspected to be involved in the incident, detained in the prison.

On Tuesday (09), police arrested seven suspects including the owner of the tattoo studio in Athurugiriya where the shooting incident took place on Monday (08), resulting in the deaths of ‘Club Wasantha’ and another person and wounded four others.

The other arrested individuals are suspected to have aided and abetted in the shooting incident.

During the investigations carried out thus far, it has been revealed that the owner of the tattoo studio has received an amount of Rs. 1 million over a period of time.
