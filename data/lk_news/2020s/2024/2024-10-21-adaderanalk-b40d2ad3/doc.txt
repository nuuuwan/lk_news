Defamatory posters against Mannar HC Judge: Main suspect evading arrest

Police have informed the Colombo Magistrate’s Court today (21) that they are launching investigations to apprehend the primary suspect involved in the incident of pasting defamatory posters targeting the Mannar High Court Judge.

The relevant plaint was called before Colombo Chief Magistrate Thilina Gamage today.

The officers of the Colombo Crime Division (CCD) have presented facts to the court, stating that investigations are ongoing to apprehend the main suspect in the incident.

Police informed the court that the primary suspect has fled his home and is evading arrest and that investigations are being carried out to locate him.

President’s Counsel Maithree Gunaratne, who is representing several suspects who have been remanded related to this case, presented the facts before the court stating that the persons remanded in custody are only witnesses of this incident

He expressed concern that if witnesses are remanded in this manner, it may hinder the police department’s ability to prove a case.

The President’s Counsel also pointed out that many cases filed by the police fail for similar reasons.

After considering these facts, the Chief Magistrate granted bail to four of the detained suspects while the remaining four were remanded until November 04.
