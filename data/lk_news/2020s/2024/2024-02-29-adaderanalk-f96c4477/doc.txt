Semasinghe rubbishes reports claiming transfer of economic centers to foreign country

State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe has asserted that the Government of Sri Lanka has not made a decision to transfer the country’s economic centers to a foreign country through an economic cooperation agreement.

Taking to ‘X’ (formerly Twitter), the State Minister noted that despite recent media reports, no such decision has been taken nor discussed.

Thus, he urged for stakeholders to refrain from falling for such false misinformation.

“In the current economic and other reform agenda, no decision has been taken or discussed to transfer economic centers to a foreign country through an economic cooperation agreement. Urge stakeholders not fall for the activities of opposition political groups who don’t tolerate economic stabilization of the country based on such false information”, his statement on ’X’ read.
