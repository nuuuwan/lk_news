Pohottuwa sheds its shackles

The decision made on Monday by the Political bureau of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna to field a candidate of its own marks a turning point in the present presidential election and in Sri Lankan politics in general. For more than two years the SLPP as a political party had been in headlong retreat. It seemed as if the Pohottuwa was destined to die a natural death, with some of its best and brightest MPs looking for leadership from outside the party. As the presidential election drew near, there was a concerted attempt to get the Pohottuwa to refrain from fielding its own candidate and to back a candidate from a different party. The Pohottuwa was being bullied into submission from within and without. Stalwarts of the Pohottuwa were appearing on other political platforms and openly declaring their allegiance to other leaders.

Given that background, Monday’s decision had to come sooner or later. The choice was between ceasing to exist and making an attempt at continuing to exist. Now the Pohottuwa has reasserted itself by refusing to back any candidate but its own. This was obviously not a decision lightly taken. It could well cause a major split in the party. Some Pohottuwa MPs who may think they have gone too far to turn back, may still continue to back a candidate from outside the party even though they realise that an independent candidate has very little chance of winning. Even if the Pohottuwa is ‘howllowed out’ with a large number of MPs deciding to support a candidate from outside the party, still, that will be a case of individual politicians without a party backing an independent candidate without a party. It is difficult to see how that will translate into victory at a presidential election.

Hence, many Pohottuwa MPs who may have been toying with the idea of falling in behind another leader but played safe and hedged their bets without shooting their mouths off too much in public, will quietly melt back into the Pohottuwa fold. The prime consideration for all sitting Pohottuwa MPs is the parliamentary election which will follow the presidential election. If they are to get back into Parliament, they will need to have a political party to contest from. If they back a candidate from outside the party, that candidate will have to win or all those who follow him will see their political careers ending with the presidential election. Without the backing of the entire Pohottuwa, a candidate from outside the party has little chance of winning. Any Pohottuwa MP who backs a candidate from outside the party will in effect be jumping off a cliff for no purpose – his sacrifice will not make his presidential candidate win. It may take some days for this reality to sink into the minds of some, but one can expect saner counsel to prevail in the end in many cases.

The most important aspect of the decision made on Monday is that the Pohottuwa voter will have a party to vote for at this election. One of the reasons for the SLPP to face near collapse after the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was the absence of a visible leader in the party. GR had resigned from the presidency and gone into retirement. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, though still the leader of the party, could not contest the presidency as he had already done his two terms and he was no longer able to lead his party on the ground the way he did until 2019. Basil Rajapaksa, who can contest the Presidency and can lead the party, is hampered by his dual citizenship which disqualifies him from contesting elections. Thus, what we had after President Gotabaya’s resignation was essentially a political party without a visible leadership, which made it easy pickings for everyone.

Ironically, months of being picked on by all and sundry has solved the biggest problem that the SLPP had –– that of a future leadership. Namal Rajapaksa has now emerged as the future leader of the SLPP by standing up for the ideology and the policies of the SLPP against those trying to seek leadership from outside the party. In a situation where it seemed that the SLPP would simply get washed away from the pages of history, Namal and a group of SLPP Parliamentarians including the party’s General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam stood their ground. They remained unfazed by the fact that many MPs who were their friends and colleagues were now looking for leadership outside the party.

The role that Namal played in the past several months was reminiscent in many ways of the role played by Mahinda Rajapaksa in the SLFP from around 1985 after the break away of Vijaya and Chandrika Kumaratunga up to the early 1990s. It was Mahinda who kept the SLFP flag flying in the face of adversity during those years after some of the most dynamic members of the party had broken away with Chandrika and Vijaya. Likewise, when it seemed that the best and brightest in the SLPP were veering towards a different leadership from outside the party, Namal emerged as the standard bearer of the Pohottuwa ideology and Pohottuwa identity as a political party. Basil Rajapaksa will remain the de facto leader of the SLPP. But the emergence of Namal in the way he did has given the SLPP a publicly visible future leadership – a factor that was lacking for the past two years.

If one takes the case of Sajith Premadasa, the other politician who happens to be the son of a former President, it has to be said that he, too, earned his right to leadership of his political party. President D. B. Wijetunga and Gamini Dissanayake facilitated his entry into politics, but thereafter they left the stage and Sajith was very much on his own in the UNP. Premadasa senior was helped by figures like Dudley Senanayake and J. R. Jayewardene to come up in the UNP. But Premadasa junior got no such help from anyone. Sajith became deputy leader of the UNP entirely under his own steam and on his own merits and against stiff resistance from certain quarters within the party. If he is now leading a political party made up mostly of former UNP members, he has earned that right.

The Pohottuwa identity is now secure and the party rank and file will have a party to vote for. A visible leader for the future has also emerged. However, what we saw on Monday was a successful holding operation which prevented the party from being overrun and practically ceasing to exist even before the presidential election. For the Pohottuwa to be able to fully salvage itself as a political party, they will have to go on the offensive by fielding a very formidable presidential candidate.
