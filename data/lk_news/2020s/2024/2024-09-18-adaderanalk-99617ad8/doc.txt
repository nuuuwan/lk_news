Education Ministry announcement on distribution of school uniforms

The Ministry of Education (MoE) has announced that it will distribute the uniforms necessary for 4.3 million school students and all the needed robes (Sivuru) for 825 ‘Pirivens’ for the upcoming 2025 school term.

Accordingly, the school uniforms and robes are to be distributed before January 20, when the 2025 new school term begins.

The school uniforms have been donated by the Chinese government, following discussions between the Education Minister, the Chinese Ambassador, and other relevant officials of the Chinese government.

According to the announcement, all school uniforms are being provided free of charge and will result in the government saving around Rs. 7 billion.

The Chinese government has confirmed that Sri Lanka will receive the first consignment of uniforms on November 13, the second on November 21, and the third on December 20.
