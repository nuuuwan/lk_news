Deposits grew by 8.60% YoY to Rs 2.148 trillion at the end of the review period.

The Group, comprising of Sri Lanka’s biggest private sector bank, its subsidiaries and an associate, reported in a filing with the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) that total assets increased by Rs 156 billion or 6.24% YoY and by Rs 130 billion or 5.15% in the three months reviewed to reach Rs 2.656 trillion as at 31st December 2023.

We look forward to building upon this foundation of success and charting new heights of prosperity in the future.”

The Group reported a total operating income of Rs 122.070 billion for the 12 months ending 31st December 2023, a decline of 10.66% over the preceding year, but an improvement over the declines of 16.74% and 27.03% recorded at the end of the third and second quarters respectively. This improvement was attributed to total operating income for the fourth quarter growing by 8.60% to Rs 35.620 billion.

Net operating income for the 12 months, at Rs 83.175 billion reflected an improvement of 28.53%, with provisions for impairment charges and other losses for the year reducing by 45.92% to Rs 38.895 billion as a result of the previous year’s higher provisions on account of foreign currency denominated bonds and the impact of the depreciation of the Rupee on the value of those provisions. The Group’s impairment charges for the fourth quarter of 2023 amounted to Rs 13.113 billion, a reduction of 33.28% over the corresponding quarter of 2022.

Taxes on financial services increased by 26.52% to Rs 4.961 billion due to the introduction of Social Security Contribution Levy of 2.5% with effect from October 1, 2022, and the increase in value addition attributable to the supply of financial services in 2022. The Group posted an operating profit of Rs 33.924 billion after taxes on financial services, recording a growth of 38.41% over the preceding year.
