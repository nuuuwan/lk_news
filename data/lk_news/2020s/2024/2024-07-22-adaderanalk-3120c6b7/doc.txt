Court orders arrest of Minister Jeevan Thondaman

The Nuwara-Eliya Magistrate’s Court has ordered the police to arrest the General Secretary of Ceylon Workers’ Congress (CWC), Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development Jeevan Thondaman and to produce him before the court.

This order has been issued after Nuwara-Eliya Police reported facts to the court today (22), regarding the incident where the CWC General Secretary had allegedly stormed into the Pedro Tea Factory, controlled under Kelani Valley Plantations PLC, along with a group of his supporters on May 30, 2024.

Ada Derana reporter said that although the police had informed the accused involved in the incident including Minister Thondaman, in writing, to appear before the court today (22), they had failed to do so.

Therefore, the Nuwara-Eliya Acting Magistrate has ordered the police to arrest the suspects including the Minister and to produce them before the court.
