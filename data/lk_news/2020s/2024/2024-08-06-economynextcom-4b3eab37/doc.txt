Sri Lanka to seek PPPs for futsal courts, Pakistan help for two

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is looking for private investors to build futsal courts within government building premises, with a Pakistan grant to be used to install two courts in the Torrington and Sugathadasa complexes, Cabinet spokesman minister Bandula Gunawardena said.

“There are several futsal indoor stadiums in urban areas,” Gunawardena told reporters on Tuesday. And since there is a higher attraction for this sport, there was need to “expand the game”.

The government plans to establish more indoor futsal stadiums at a commercial level, he said, and is looking for private investors for constructing them in “identified government lands and sports complex premises”.

The state will provide the property on an 80-year-lease basis, to a private investor under a public-private partnership, the minister said.

A Pakistan Government grant will be used to install two courts in the Torrington and Sugathadasa sports complexes, Gunawardena said.

Futsal is a popular after-office game played on an indoor artificial pitch 40 x 20 meters wide, and 4 meters high.

The football-based game is similar to its five-a-side version, and is played indoors. (Colombo/Aug6/2024)
