Colombo among first 9  destinations to join  Emirates’ A350 network

Colombo will be among the first set of destinations to be served by Emirates’ A350 aircraft entering service in September 2024, the airline announced yesterday.

Emirates’ fourth daily service to Colombo, EK654/655, will be served by A350 from January 1, 2025.

With 10 new A350s expected to join the Emirates fleet by March 31, 2025, the airline plans to deploy its latest aircraft type to nine destinations in the coming months, offering the customers its latest signature cabin experiences.

These first 10 Emirates A350 aircraft will offer three cabin classes, with 32 next-generation Business Class seats, 21 seats in Premium Economy and 259 Economy Class seats. All of these aircraft are earmarked to serve short to medium-haul cities on the Emirates network, with Bahrain as its inaugural destination. As the first Emirates A350s begin entering the fleet, the airline will offer the customers more opportunities to experience its highly acclaimed Premium Economy product and sample its next-generation Business Class cabins for the first time, particularly on short and medium-haul routes in the Middle East and GCC, West Asia and Europe.

“The A350 will be a game changer for Emirates, enabling us to serve regional points with superior operating efficiency and flexibility across the Middle East and GCC, West Asia and Europe.

Flying A350 to nine cities in such a short span of time adds more premium cabin options and choice across geographies for our customers and ensures we maintain our competitive edge and industry-leading position,” said Emirates Airline Deputy President and Chief Commercial Officer Adnan Kazim.
