SAB Campus of CA Sri Lanka signs MOU with AATSL for BSc. in Applied Accounting Degree exemptions

The SAB Campus of The Chartered Institute of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) and the Association of Accounting Technicians Sri Lanka (AATSL) recently embarked on a new path in accounting by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) aimed at advancing and collaborating professional education. The MOU grants exemptions for members of AATSL by way of lateral entry to the BSc. in Applied Accounting (General) Degree Program.

The primary objective of this collaboration is to enhance the qualification process for students aiming to obtain an accounting degree from CA Sri Lanka. By providing these exemptions, the MoU opens up new avenues for AATSL members to pursue a globally recognised degree that is approved by the Ministry of Education and recognised by the University Grants Commission. This partnership not only reinforces the commitment of both institutions to academic excellence but also ensures that students have access to a world-class education that meets international standards.

CA Sri Lanka President Heshana Kuruppu and AAT Sri Lanka President Indraka Liyanage, signed the MOU on 16 July 2024 at the Hilton Colombo Residencies. CA Sri Lanka Vice President Tishan Subasinghe, AAT Sri Lanka Vice President Dr. Chamara Bandara, SAB Campus of CA Sri Lanka CEO Lakmali Priyangika, AAT Sri Lanka CEO Tishanga Kumarasinghe, and Council members of CA Sri Lanka and AAT Sri Lanka were present at the event.

CA Sri Lanka President Heshana Kuruppu said the MOU grants an efficient pathway for students. “This is a great opportunity for those seeking to pursue further studies in accounting. This MOU will facilitate seamless academic progression for AAT members, apart from resource sharing among the two institutes.”

“This collaboration brings together the expertise and resources of our professional bodies with the academic excellence of SAB campus. We are particularly excited about the opportunities and this partnership will create a pathway for AATSL members”, explained AAT Sri Lanka President Indraka Liyanage.

Founded in 1959, CA Sri Lanka is the national professional accounting body, dedicated to promoting and advancing the accounting profession both within the country and internationally. AATSL, meanwhile, is a premier higher education institution in Sri Lanka, specialising in accounting technician-level qualifications. Together, these two institutions have played a pivotal role in shaping the accounting landscape in Sri Lanka, and this new partnership is expected to further elevate the standards of accounting education in the country.
