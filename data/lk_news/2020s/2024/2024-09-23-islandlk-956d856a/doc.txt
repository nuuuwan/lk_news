Vision-impaired musicians

There is a group of extraordinary musicians who are blind and, over the past year, Melantha Perera has personally taken it upon himself to mentor these vision-impaired students through his music school Riversheen School of Music.

Melantha, who is a big name in the showbiz scene, both here and abroad, has named this group of musicians as ‘Bright Light’.

Says Melantha: “‘Bright Light’ is Sri Lanka’s first beat band made up of vision-impaired musicians and their passion for music is truly inspiring.”

He went on to say that he teaches them, online, and that they meet once a month for a practice session at MJF Centre, Katubadda, Moratuwa.

“I share my expertise with them, individually, to play as a band, and we are planning to have a show for them, early next year, to showcase the incredible talent of these young musicians.

“The event would give them the opportunity to share their gifts with the world and take a step closer to realizing their dreams.”
