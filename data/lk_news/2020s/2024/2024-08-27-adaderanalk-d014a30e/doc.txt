SLPP to unveil its election manifesto in Sept. first week

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is set to unveil its presidential election manifesto in the first week of September.

SLPP media spokesperson Sanjeeva Edirimanna said that the party is currently in the final phase of preparing the policy statement.

Meanwhile, the Presidential Candidate of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MP Namal Rajapaksa has emphasized the importance of strengthening the ‘Samurdhi’ programme.

Speaking at a rally in Nawalapitiya, Rajapaksa criticized the negative perception some leaders have about the programme, which he argues has been crucial in alleviating poverty in Sri Lanka.

The SLPP’s Presidential Candidate stated that certain leaders think that the ‘Samurdhi’ movement has failed and that however, it was the same movement that saved the people of this country from poverty.

Rajapaksa further proposed that efforts should be made to help beneficiaries’ children find suitable employment in various sectors, including technology and agriculture, to take them out of poverty.

He pledged to implement policies aimed at transforming Samurdhi recipients into entrepreneurs, beyond simply strengthening the ‘Samurdhi’ programme, if elected.
