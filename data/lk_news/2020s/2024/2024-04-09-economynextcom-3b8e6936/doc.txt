KKS Port acquires Sri Lanka Cement Corp land

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Port Authority owned Kankasanthurai Port has acquired 23 acres and 12 perches of land belonging to the Cement Corporation, Cabinet spokesman Minister Bandula Gunawardena said.

“After the Surveyor General’s assessment, the Port Authority has paid an advance of 52 million rupees to the Sri Lanka Cement Corporation,” Gunawardena told reporters on Tuesday announcing the week’s Cabinet decisions.

“Accordingly these identified lands will be transferred legally as per State Lands Ordinance 6 (1) to the Kankasanthurai Port for its development.”

India recently pledged 61.5 million dollars in grant aid to develop Kankasanthurai Port in the island’s Northern Jaffna peninsula.

As part of the project, a new breakwater will be constructed, and the port will be dredged up to a depth of 30 metres to accommodate deep-draft vessels

The KKS Port began operations as a commercial port coinciding with the establishment of the Cement Factory in Kankesanthurai in 1950.

The Sri Lanka Cement Corporation, with around 5,000 acres of mineral resource-rich land, is to be restructured, the State Minister of Primary Industries said earlier this year. (Colombo/Apr9/2024)
