Labour companionship program launched for expectant mothers

In celebration of Mother's Day today, the Professorial Obstetric Unit of Colombo South Teaching Hospital, Kalubowila, has announced the launch of its latest initiative, the "Maathru Saheli” Labour Companion" programme.

This program, conceptualized by the Sri Lanka College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists and executed under the guidance of the Ministry of Health, aims to provide emotional support and care for expectant mothers throughout the process of normal delivery. By allowing either the mother or a female relative/friend to serve as her "labour companion," the initiative offers expectant mothers the privilege of having a trusted female companion by their side. This companion can offer courage, comfort, and moral support, ensuring a positive childbirth experience.

Many expectant mothers have voiced concerns about the challenges of normal childbirth, citing hospital policies that are not always patient-friendly and a lack of moral support, leading to maternal anxiety, pain, and fear. Our programme seeks to address these concerns by providing expectant mothers with a dedicated supporter of their choice to accompany them every step of the way. Through this initiative, we aim to empower mothers to undergo normal vaginal delivery with confidence, better understanding, and peace of mind, promoting the concept of respectful maternal care. Pix by Kithsiri de Mel
