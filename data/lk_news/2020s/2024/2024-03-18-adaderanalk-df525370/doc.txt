School principals informed to postpone sports meets due to hot weather

School Principals have been informed in writing to postpone sports meets and other outdoor activities in view of the prevailing high temperatures, the Ministry of Education announced.

Accordingly, the Ministry of Education has advised school principals to postpone the relevant activities until April 24, 2024.

Furthermore, it is informed to postpone all outdoor activities including sports meets and other competitions until the third phase of the first school term which will commence on April 24 and to draw special attention to the health of the students, owing to the prevailing hot weather conditions.

On Sunday (17), Minister of Education Susil Premajayantha said school principals will be informed through a circular to organise the inter-house sports meets and sports events of their respective schools after the Sinhala and Tamil New Year holidays.

The minister pointed out that it had been observed that many schools have organised inter-house sports meets regardless of the prevailing hot weather conditions across the island.

Minister Susil Premajayantha said that since the first school term will continue even after the New Year holidays, it is possible to hold sports meets and other outdoor sporting events during that period.

Meanwhile, the Department of Meteorology stated that the heat index, the temperature felt on the human body, is expected to increase up to ‘Caution level’ at some places in North-western, North-central, Eastern, Western provinces and Monaragala, Mannar, Rathnapura and Vavuniya districts today (18).
