In a remarkable demonstration of innovation and sustainability, Sri Lanka’s largest textile manufacturer Hayleys Fabric PLC proudly announced its achievement at the prestigious ISPO Textrends Spring/Summer 2026, where three pioneering innovations were recognised.

Serving as a key global benchmark for innovation in the textile industry, the German platform showcases breakthrough advancements of the world’s most innovative and high-performance fabrics.

“We are delighted to have our relentless pursuit of sustainable innovation recognised again, as it underscores our dedication to ensuring we break new ground in textiles that benefit both the industry and the planet. We firmly believe sustainability and innovation are key drivers for Sri Lanka’s export sector and we are committed to continuously developing solutions that meet the evolving needs of the global apparel industry while minimising our environmental footprint,” Hayleys Fabric Managing Director Rohan Goonetilleke said.

Hayleys Fabric’s Eco Stretch was recognised as the Best Product in the Base Layer category consolidating its commitment to recyclable technology. The pioneering material breaks new ground as it melds remarkable stretch ability with environmental sustainability, presenting a recyclable solution that ensures neither performance nor comfort is compromised.

The manufacturer’s Moisture Osmosis technology was ranked among the Top 10 Chemical Finishes. The material was celebrated for its exceptional one-way moisture transference quality and outstanding durability, which guarantees the wearers remain dry and comfortable, heralding a new era for performance apparel with its superior technology.

Similarly, Aqua Soft, Hayleys Fabric’s response to the global trend on longevity, was ranked among the Top 30 fabrics globally. The high-performance fabric challenges the conventions of outdoor apparel, marrying technological advancement with the natural comfort of cotton while offering unparalleled UV protection. The material prioritises user comfort and environmental sustainability while ensuring maximum comfort during wear.

Notably, the achievement builds upon the manufacturer’s impressive track record with its natural mahogany dye, which previously secured a spot on ISPO Textrends’ Top 10 Innovations list for 2024.

The recognition follows multiple initiatives driven by the manufacturer, including a ground-breaking collaboration with Pro Green Laboratories of the University of Moratuwa to upcycle industrial waste and convert it into sustainable, environmentally friendly construction materials.
