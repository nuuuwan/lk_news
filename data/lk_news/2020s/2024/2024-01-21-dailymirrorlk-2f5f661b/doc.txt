Controversial monk ’Vishwa Buddha’ arrested again by CID

Gampaha, Jan 21 (Daily Mirror) - The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) once again arrested the saffron-robed monk who identifies himself as ‘Vishwa Buddha,’ in Kalagedihena.

In December of last year, the CID's cybercrimes unit arrested the monk for allegedly insulting Buddhism on social media and he was remanded after being produced before court. Later he was released on bail by Colombo Chief Magistrate Prasanna Alwis on January 9.

Known for his controversial online presence, 'Vishwa Buddha' had posted videos on various social media platforms containing content deemed offensive to Buddhism.  Police said he was arrested in response to numerous complaints.

Earlier, a court order had been issued to produce him before court after it was discovered that he had allegedly continued his usual behavior despite court warnings.

The arrested monk will be produced in the Gangodawila Magistrat'es Court.
