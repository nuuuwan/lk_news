Bakery owners to announce decision on price of bread

The All Ceylon Bakery Ownersâ€™ Association (ACBOA) says it will make a announcement tomorrow (26) regarding a potential reduction in the price of bread.

The president of the association, N.K. Jayawardena indicated that a special discussion was held yesterday (24) with regard to reducing the price of bread, but no final agreement was reached.

The consideration of a price reduction follows the recent comments made by Minister of Trade Nalin Fernando, who warned that a control price for bread would be imposed if bakery owners do not take steps to lower prices.

This has prompted bakery owners to direct attention on reducing the prices of bakery products, including bread.

However, Jayawardena atates that a final decision on whether the bread price will be reduced is expected to be made tomorrow (25).
