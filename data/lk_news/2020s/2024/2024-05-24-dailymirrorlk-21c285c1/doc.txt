Over 300,000 power disruptions due to bad weather

Colombo, May 24 (Daily Mirror) - Over 300,000 power disruption incidents were reported during the past few days with more than 30,000 occurring within a single hour on some days, the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers' Union (CEBEU) said.

While issuing a media release they said they had experienced significant delays in restoring power outages caused by recent severe weather conditions.

The CEBEU has expressed regret over these delays, attributing them to the limited number of technical staff available to address the issues.

Additionally, the high volume of calls has overwhelmed CEB telephone operators, leading to many calls from consumers going unanswered.

The union has urged the public to exercise patience and caution, advising them not to touch any live wires during outages, while the technical teams work to restore power as quickly as possible.
