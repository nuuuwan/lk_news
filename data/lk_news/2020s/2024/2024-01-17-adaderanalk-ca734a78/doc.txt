Special notice on commencement of second phase of third school term

The Education Ministry has announced the dates to commence the second phase of the third term of government and government-approved private schools.

Accordingly, the second phase of the third school term is scheduled to begin on February 05 (Monday).

However, commencement of the second phase of the third term has been pushed back after Paper I and Paper II of the 2023 Advanced Level examination’s Agricultural Science subject was annulled and a new date was set for the test.

The Examinations Department said the new exam date and time would be as follows:

Time: Paper II (from 08:30 a.m. to 11:40 a.m.) / Paper I (from 01:00 p.m. to 03:00 p.m.)

On January 12, the Examinations Department decided to cancel the A/L exam’s Agricultural Science I & II question papers, due to reports that several questions of the paper had been leaked prior to the exam.

Two days later, the Agricultural Science teacher, 52, of a popular government school in Ampara was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in connection with the incident. Subsequently, a 38-year-old man who had served as the peon of the chief of the exam centre at the Moratuwa Maha Vidyalaya was also arrested over his suspected complicity.
