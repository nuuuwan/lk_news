NPP most suitable camp for women – Harini tells diaspora meeting in London

Claims other parties have followed NPP’s lead to focus on increasing women’s involvement in politics

Stresses women must actively participate in politics to reform existing system

Notes NPP women’s summits serve a greater purpose than merely bringing NPP into power

Urges women abroad to support these efforts by informing and educating their friends and family in SL

National People’s Power (NPP) MP Dr. Harini Amarasuriya recently declared that the NPP dedicated to fostering significant social change in Sri Lanka, stands out as the most appropriate political platform for women.

Speaking at the NPP’s inaugural international women’s summit in London on 16 March, Amarasuriya reminisced about how NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake had assented to the party’s women’s wing’s plea for 50% representation in the forthcoming General Election as early as 2019.

“Though we initially requested 50% representation, we soon recognised the formidable challenge for women to actively participate in politics. Even those of us already engaged in political spheres hesitated to step forward as candidates, highlighting the immense obstacles ahead,” she remarked. Amarasuriya remarked that alongside the NPP, other political parties have also started to focus on increasing women’s involvement in politics.

“Women must actively participate in politics to reform the existing system. We have stepped forward to challenge the violent and reprehensible nature of politics that we find unacceptable. There’s a pressing need to transform the political culture and infuse it with new purpose. It’s increasingly clear that the NPP provides the most conducive environment for women to drive political progress and instigate social change. We don’t seek a politics that merely shuffles parliamentary seats during elections. The NPP has demonstrated that it is the ideal platform for women to lead and enact meaningful transformations,” she maintained.

She highlighted that since 2021, the NPP has established electorate committees in 11,000 Grama Seva Divisions, with a stipulation that 30% of the membership should comprise women. “Nevertheless, we encountered challenges in encouraging women to participate in these committees initially. Subsequently, we decided to establish women’s committees, and remarkably, women began to join these committees in significant numbers,” she explained.

The NPP MP observed that the responsibilities of women in their workplaces, homes, and society have become increasingly burdensome and complex, prompting many to take to the streets in protest.

She said that the women’s summits, which commenced on 30 December, required months of grassroots efforts to ensure their success. “The women’s committees persist in their efforts and are growing stronger,” she said, adding that the process is one far greater than merely one put in place to bring the NPP to power.

“This journey is about achieving significant social change,” she emphasised. The MP urged Sri Lankan women living abroad to lend their support to these efforts, even though they may not currently reside in Sri Lanka.

“Take the initiative to inform and educate those closest to you, whether through a phone call or a social media message. Let us make sure that this year marks the beginning of a significant change in the country,” she urged.
