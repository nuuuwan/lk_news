Sri Lanka travel advisory still at level 2, same as France and Italy: US Ambassador

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s overall travel advisory has not been raised after the Arugam Bay related threats, and remains at levels of many other countries, US Ambassador Julie Chung said.

“Our overall travel advisory for Sri Lanka remains exactly the same, at Level 2, which has been so for many years,” she told reporters in Colombo Monday.

“And this is similar to advisories of many other popular destinations including the Maldives, France and Italy. All the same at Level 2; Sri Lanka remains at Level 2,” she said.

A Level 2 travel advisory means travelers should exercise increased caution.

Common risk indicators for countries that have a Level 2 advisory include crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and kidnapping.

“I want to also correct some misinformation out there. There is no travel ban on Sri Lanka. Our security alert last week was for Americans to avoid Arugam Bay until further notice.”

Hard travel advisories usually advise citizens to defer non-essential travel.

Israel, however, issued a broad advisory asking citizens to defer non-essential travel and said the threat level has been raised.

“The travel alert for Arugam Bay and the coastal areas in south and west Sri Lanka (including for the cities Ahangame, Galle, Hikkaduwa and Weligama) has been raised to level 4,” the Israel’s National Security Council said in a statement. (Colombo/Oct28/2024)
