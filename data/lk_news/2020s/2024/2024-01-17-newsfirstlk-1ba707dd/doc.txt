CEB Hotline Aims to Halt Elephant Electrocutions

COLOMBO (News 1st); In a bid to curb the rising toll of elephant deaths caused by unauthorized electricity connections, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has launched a dedicated hotline for reporting such infringements.

As part of its efforts to protect Sri Lanka's wild elephant population, the CEB is urging the public to report any instances of illegal connections to fences or wires by dialing 1987.

This initiative highlights the growing concern over the threat posed by such practices to the country's iconic wildlife.

The CEB acknowledged a decrease in elephant deaths from electrocution compared to previous years, with only 50 reported fatalities in 2023.
