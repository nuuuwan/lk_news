Cabraal, four others released from Treasury Bill case

Colombo, May 31 (Daily Mirror) - The Colombo High Court today ordered to release former Governor of the Central Bank Ajith Nivard Cabraal and four others from a corruption case filed by the Bribery Commission.

The Colombo High Court made this order taking into account the preliminary objections raised by the defence challenging the maintainability of the case.

The Bribery Commission had filed indictments against five accused for causing a loss of Rs. 1,843.3 million to the government through the purchase of Treasury Bills in 2012.
