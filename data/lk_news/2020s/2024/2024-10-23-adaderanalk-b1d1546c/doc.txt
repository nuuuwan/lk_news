Former minister Johnston Fernando arrives at CID

Former Minister Johnston Fernando has arrived at the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to provide a statement regarding the unregistered luxury car allegedly belonging to him, which was found parked at a star-class hotel in Colombo.

A petition filed by Fernando, seeking an order to prevent his arrest over the incident, was taken up for consideration yesterday (22).

During the hearing, his attorneys informed the court that Fernando was prepared to appear before the CID today to give a statement on the matter.

The court has scheduled the petition to be called again on October 25.

Meanwhile, speaking to the media, Fernando remarked, “Let’s see what happens. Time will answer the questions. Truth will prevail.”
