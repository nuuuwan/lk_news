Inmate at Galle Prison currently receiving treatment for meningitis

Another case of meningitis has been reported within the Galle Prison, nearly a month after a series of such cases were reported from several prisons across the country.

Accordingly, an inmate who had been imprisoned on February is currently receiving treatment at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital after displaying symptoms of meningitis.

Director of the Prison Health Services Dr. Hemantha Ranasinghe stated, however, that the inmate is not in critical condition, and has been the only one to displays such symptoms thus far.

Earlier this year, and in latter stage of 2023, several inmates of the Galle and Matara Prisons contracted meningitis, of whom three died.
