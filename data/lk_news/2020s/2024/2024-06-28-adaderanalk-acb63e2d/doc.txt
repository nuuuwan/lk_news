Cocaine and Kush cannabis worth over Rs. 190M inside ‘whey protein’ containers

Officers of the Sri Lanka Customs Narcotics Control Unit have seized cocaine and ‘Kush’ cannabis estimated to be worth nearly Rs. 160 million found inside 6 parcels during inspections carried out at a courier clearance station in Seeduwa.

A total of 2,030 grams of cocaine and 2,177 grams of ‘Kush’ cannabis were found inside several whey protein powder containers packed in the parcels, which had been sent from Canada and America to addresses in Colombo and Kadawatha.

However, following investigations conducted regarding the respective addresses, it has been revealed that those addresses are fake.

The parcels were opened due to suspicion as no one had come forward to collect them even after one month had passed since their arrival, a spokesman said.

The Sri Lanka Customs said that the estimated street value of drugs is almost Rs. 190 million.

The confiscated drugs are to be handed over to the Police Narcotics Bureau for further investigations.
