Sri Lanka beat India by 32 runs to take lead in ODI series

Sri Lanka registered a memorable comeback 32-run win in the second ODI against India in Colombo on Sunday, August 4.

The hosts also claimed their first ODI win against the world no.1 India after 1,108 days with a 1-0 lead in three three-match series.

Kamindu Mendis and Avishka Fernando helped Sri Lanka post a challenging total of 240 while batting first and then the experienced spinner Jeffrey Vandersy picked six wickets to bowl out India to 28 in 42.2 overs.

Rohit Sharma scored another quick fifty to give India a stunning start while chasing a manageable target at R Premadasa Stadium. But the Men in Blues witnessed an embarrassing collapse from 97/0 to 147/6 with Vandersay claiming all first six wickets in one of the best ODI spells in Sri Lanka cricket history.

Sri Lanka last defeated India in an ODI game in July 2021 at the same venue and last won a bilateral series in August 1997. The Indian cricket team is waiting on their historic 100th ODI win against Sri Lanka to become the first team to achieve such a milestone and will look to claim it in the third ODI on Wednesday.
