Natural Body Scrubs…

Readers have inquired about body scrubs, so this week my Beauty Tips are connected with body scrubs.

You will need ½ cup of ground coffee, 1/4th cup of sugar and 02 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil.

Mix the three items well and then use the mixture on clean skin for exfoliation

Coffee has strong antioxidant properties. It accelerates the blood flow and fights premature signs of ageing. It also helps with cellulite and stretch marks. It gets rid of your tan without being harsh on your skin.

You will need 01 tablespoon of plain yoghurt, 1/4th cup of olive oil, 03 tablespoons of sugar and 01 tablespoon of honey.

Yoghurt has brightening, moisturising and toning properties. It is packed with B Vitamins which act as a natural lotion for the body. Overall, it’s a great ingredient for those with dry skin.

You will need ½ cup of brown sugar, 1/4th cup of olive oil, and 02 tablespoons of honey.

Honey helps in soothing, moisturising and repairing your skin. It also protects your skin from any UV damage. Brown sugar is packed with essential minerals and acts as a great natural scrub when used for exfoliation.

You will need ½ cup uncooked oatmeal, ½ cup of brown sugar, ½ cup of honey and 1/4th cup of jojoba oil.

Mix well the oatmeal and sugar and then add the honey and jojoba oil.

Oatmeal is one of the best natural exfoliating ingredients, especially for dry and dehydrated skin that lacks nourishment.

4. Leave it on for a few minutes then rinse with lukewarm water.

6. Also make sure you apply a broad spectrum sunscreen to avoid any sun damage as the skin becomes more photosensitive after exfoliation.
