Minister outlines reforms to streamline university admissions

Minister of Education, Susil Premajayantha, announced that the G.C.E. Ordinary Level (O/L) and Advanced Level (A/L) examinations will be expedited to facilitate faster university enrollment for students.

The goal is to enable students to complete their schooling by the age of 18 and seamlessly transition into higher education.

Speaking at a ceremony recognizing the top achievers of the G.C.E. Advanced Level Examination, Minister Premajayantha highlighted the reforms aimed at minimizing delays in the educational timeline.

He emphasized that A/L studies will now begin before the release of O/L results, allowing for continuous academic progress without the previous 4-5 month gap traditionally experienced between the two examination stages.

Starting this year, the A/L examination, which has typically been held in November, will be rescheduled to September by 2025. This change aims to streamline the process and reduce the waiting period for university admissions.

Minister Premajayantha also expressed his commitment to enhancing the infrastructure and resources necessary for the effective implementation of these academic activities within schools and universities.

The reforms are designed not only to accelerate the educational process but also to foster spaces for innovation and adaptability in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.

He underscored the importance of equipping students with knowledge and experience in emerging fields such as artificial intelligence and highlighted the need to develop a legal framework to govern the use of such technologies within the educational system.

The Minister stressed the need for preparing students for the future which requires both a solid educational foundation and an awareness of the legal and ethical implications of new technologies.
