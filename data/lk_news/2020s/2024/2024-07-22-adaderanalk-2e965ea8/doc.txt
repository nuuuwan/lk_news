Teachers and principals launch ‘work-to-rule’ campaign

The Teacher-Principal Trade Unions have decided to launch a ‘work-to-rule’ campaign for two weeks starting from today (22).

Accordingly, the unions say that they will not participate in the workshops, any external professional activities and training programmes prescribed by the provincial and zonal education offices from today.

The General Secretary of the National Association of Principals, Parakrama Weerasinghe said, that in the next two weeks they will only be involved in teaching activities in the classrooms and will withdraw from all external activities.

However, the Convenor of the National Collective Against Teachers’ & Principals’ Salary Disparities Ven. Ulapane Sumangala Thero said that they do not support the union action planned with the aim of strengthening political movements.
