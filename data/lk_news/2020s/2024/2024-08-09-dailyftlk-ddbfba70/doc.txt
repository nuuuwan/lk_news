People will vote RW out of gratitude – Ruwan Wijewardene

UNP Deputy leader Ruwan Wijewardene says party will fully back President

Assures Wickremesinghe’s victory is secure as people will support him as a gesture of gratitude

Expresses belief that Wickremesinghe should be allowed another five years to carry out his program to rebuild nation

United National Party (UNP) Deputy leader Ruwan Wijewardene has expressed strong confidence that Sri Lankan voters will support President Ranil Wickremesinghe in the upcoming 21 September election out of gratitude.

Addressing a press conference yesterday Wijewardene said, “Citizens are coming together to vote for President Wickremesinghe as a gesture of appreciation, regardless of which party or candidate emerges in the election.” He assured that Wickremesinghe’s victory is therefore secured. Wijewardene also took a jab at the newly formed Samagi Jana Sandhanaya (SJS), which is backing Sajith Premadasa’s candidacy. He argued that no matter which alliances form, or candidates enter the race, Wickremesinghe’s accomplishments speak for themselves.

“President Wickremesinghe has stabilised a bankrupt country and strengthened its economy.

To ensure the continuation of his successful program and to benefit the people, he should be given another five years,” he emphasised. He affirmed the UNP’s full support for Wickremesinghe’s decision to run as an independent candidate rather than under a UNP ticket, pledging to fully back his campaign and work towards his victory.

Wijewardene also revealed that many parties are continuing to engage in discussions with Wickremesinghe ahead of the elections.
