ATIRE, a fast-emerging leader in industrial tires, has announced a global first: the launch of its certified carbon-neutral solid tire range.

This groundbreaking achievement positions ATIRE as the world’s first company to offer carbon-neutral industrial tires, reflecting a significant leap forward in sustainable manufacturing.

The certification, issued by Control Union under rigorous ISO standards, applies to ATIRE’s premium range of solid tires, including products for forklifts, telehandlers, skid-steer loaders, scissor lifts, and port applications. These tires are not just durable and high-performing; they are also carbon-neutral, covering emissions from raw materials, manufacturing processes, and the product’s journey up to the factory gate.

ATIRE’s journey toward carbon neutrality began in November of last year when it was certified as a carbon-neutral organization by the Sri Lanka Climate Fund. Since then, the company has continuously evolved its manufacturing processes, embedding sustainability at the core of its operations. Key initiatives include using renewable energy, advanced nanotechnology for lower energy consumption, and 100% biomass-generated steam to eliminate fossil fuel reliance.

ATIRE General Manager Ajith Dharmasiri said: “At ATIRE, our dedication to fighting climate change extends throughout the entire organization. From our factory teams to executive leadership, we are united in our mission to reduce emissions and drive meaningful environmental change.” The company’s sustainability efforts go beyond carbon-neutral products. By producing longer-lasting tires, ATIRE reduces waste and landfill impact. Its commitment to recycling is evident, with over 80% of factory waste being reprocessed. Additionally, ATIRE’s innovative greener commute initiative encourages employees to reduce transportation emissions through a free shuttle service.

Founded in 2019 by Anurath Abeyratne, a veteran entrepreneur in the industrial tire sector, ATIRE has grown rapidly, now serving customers in over 40 countries. Its global expansion includes a mobile tire service in the UK and a distribution center in Charleston, South Carolina, providing faster lead times for North American clients. ATIRE’s certified carbon-neutral industrial tire range is more than a technological breakthrough; it represents a new benchmark in sustainable business practices, demonstrating that industry can advance without compromising the planet.
