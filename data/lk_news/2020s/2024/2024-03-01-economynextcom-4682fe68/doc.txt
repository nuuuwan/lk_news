ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has published an action plan to combat corruption, which includes reforms to a bribery commission, public tendering, state enterprise governance and an asset recovery law, following a governance diagnostic report published as part of an International Monetary Fund program

“At the request of Sri Lanka, a Governance Diagnostic Assessment (GDA) was concluded by the IMF and based on recommendations the Ministry of Finance has published the Government Action Plan on the 29th Feb 2024,” State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe said on x (twitter).

“This further demonstrates the government’s commitment to building a sustainable economy and good governance in the country,” Semasinghe said.
