Girl guides, youth organizations contribute to drug prevention programs: Sri Lanka president

ECONOMYNEXT – Youth organisations like the girl guides can play a role in drug prevention programs, Sri Lanka’s President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said.

“These organizations can achieve great things. Discussions with the anti-narcotics committee highlighted the need for more scouting and guiding associations and cadet corps in schools, which can greatly contribute to the anti-narcotics program,” Wickremesinghe told a gathering of Guides.

“Education should not be limited to textbooks. Children need new opportunities to advance and we will invest in those opportunities.”

Wickremesinghe was speaking at the President’s Guide Award Ceremony 2022/2023 held today (31) at the Bandaranaike International Conference Hall (BMICH) in Colombo.

“We aim to develop the Girl Guide Association in all aspects, increasing its membership from 75,000 to 150,000. The government is committed to providing the necessary support.”

The government is prepared to provide support to establish scout and Guides camps at the district and national levels, the president said. (Colombo/Jul31/2024)
