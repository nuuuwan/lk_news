Banana and Olive Oil Mask

This week I have for you a mask that contains only two items – banana and olive oil. And this is what you have to do…

Mash one ripe banana, until it becomes a smooth paste, and then add a tablespoon of olive oil into the mashed banana. Blend well to create an even mixture.

Using clean fingers, or a brush, apply the mask evenly to your face, avoiding the eye area.

After 20 minutes, rinse off the mask thoroughly with lukewarm water and then pat your face dry with a soft towel.

Follow up with your favourite moisturizer to lock in the benefits of the mask.

The combination of banana and olive oil provides intense hydration to dry skin. And dry skin is what most of us are experiencing these days because of the awful heat. Bananas are packed with moisture, helping to hydrate and soften the skin.

This mask helps in smoothening out rough patches, and uneven texture, leaving your skin feeling soft and supple.

Yes, olive oil contains vitamins E and K, which are known for their nourishing properties. Vitamin E helps in repairing and protecting the skin from damage, while vitamin K aids in reducing inflammation and promoting healthy skin. Olive oil is also rich in essential fatty acids that nourish and revitalize the skin, leaving it with a healthy glow.

Both banana and olive oil are rich in antioxidants, which help in fighting free radicals and maintaining youthful-looking skin.

(You don’t need to do this on a daily basis but as often as possible)
