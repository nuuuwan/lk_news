Flexible work shifts for Muslim public sector officers during Ramadan season

Special changes are to be made to the public sector work shifts to facilitate the Muslim officers who are taking part in prayers and religious activities in view of the Ramadan season this year.

This was communicated by way of a circular issued by the Ministry of Public Administration, addressed to the Ministerial Secretaries, Provincial Chief Secretaries, Heads of Departments and Heads of State Corporations and Statutory Boards earlier last week.

The Ramadan season is set to begin on 12 March and end on 11 April.

As such, the ministry has given instructions to make necessary arrangements to enable Muslim officers to take part in the prayers and religious activities during this period.

The communiqué notes that the work shifts should be arranged whenever possible to allow Muslim officers to participate in religious activities.

Special leave may be approved only in case of unavoidable circumstances, it reads further.

Additionally, directives were given to grant the ‘festival advance’ to eligible Muslim officers in the public service, public corporations and statutory boards 14 days before the end of Ramadan season.
