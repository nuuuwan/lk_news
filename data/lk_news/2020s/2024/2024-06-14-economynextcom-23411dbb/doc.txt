Sri Lanka to tax housing in IMF deal, VAT on digital services, services export exemption to go

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will impose tax on owner occupied houses, charge value added tax on digital services, and remove exemptions on services exports, under a revised deal agreed with the International Monetary Fund.

The IMF in particular has been pushing a wealth tax claiming it was ‘critical’.

A tax will be imposed on owner-occupied houses on an imputed rent calculation, according to a program agreed with the IMF and approved by its Board on June 12.

The money will be given to Municipal Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas,

Concerns have been raised about wealth-style taxes which are imposed on assets without any cashflows to pay, in a country where existing and past measures have discouraged house building and costs are prohibitive and unaffordable in part due to currency depreciation.

Valued added tax will be imposed on digital services, as part of a slew of new tax measures.

Some Sri Lanka businesses have started to set up office in the UAE which has an currency board like regime and low taxes due to long term stability and reduced economic crises.

Stamp duty on leases will be increased to 0.2 percent from 0.1 percent.

Income tax on alcohol, gaming and alcohol businesses  will be raised to 45 percent from 40 percent.

“The package of new tax policy measures is expected to be submitted to Parliament by end-June 2024 and approved by end-July 2024 to take effect in January 2025,” the IMF report said.

Sri Lanka is raising taxes under ‘revenue based fiscal consolidation’ without cutting spending (spending based consolidation), in a strategy that pre-dated a sovereign default and led to a rise in spending to GDP.

In December 2019 some of the new taxes were reversed after currency crises from flexible inflation targeting/potential output gap targeting reduced growth, ratcheted up external debt, led to trade controls and turfed out a reformist administration.

Sri Lanka is now raising taxes after extreme macro-economic policy involving both tax cuts and further money printing drove the country into an external default and negative growth. (Colombo/June12/2024)
