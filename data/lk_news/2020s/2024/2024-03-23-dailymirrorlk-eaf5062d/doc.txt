Prices of imported goods to be announced on a daily basis

Colombo, March 23 (Daily Mirror) - In response to mounting concerns over rising prices of essential goods and the devaluation of the Sri Lankan Rupee against the US Dollar, State Minister for Finance Dr. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya has unveiled a new strategy aimed at stabilising the market ahead of the upcoming festive season.

Addressing the media, Siyambalapitiya announced that the prices of imported goods and the Value Added Tax (VAT) will now be disclosed on a daily basis.

This initiative, scheduled to commence next Monday, will be executed by the Consumer Affairs Authority.

The move is intended to provide consumers with real-time information and better control over their spending amidst inflationary pressures.

Furthermore, Dr. Siyambalapitiya affirmed that all necessary arrangements have been made to guarantee an uninterrupted flow of goods, averting any potential shortages that could disrupt during the festive season.
