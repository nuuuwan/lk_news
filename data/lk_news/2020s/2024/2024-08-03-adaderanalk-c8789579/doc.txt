Govt’s decision to import eggs criticized

The Sri Lanka Association of Animal Production (SLAAP) has criticized the government’s decision to import eggs, attributing it to the government’s failure to establish a system to regulate the price of agricultural products.

President of the association, Ajith Gunasekara stated that importing eggs without such a system in place will harm the local industry.

However, he assured that there is a possibility of providing eggs and chicken without shortages for the upcoming festival season.
