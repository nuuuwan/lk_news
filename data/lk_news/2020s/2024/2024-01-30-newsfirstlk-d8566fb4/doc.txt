Imran Khan sentenced to 10 years in jail for leaking state secrets

Colombo (News 1st) â€“ A Pakistani court handed former Prime Minister Imran Khan a 10-year jail term on Tuesday (30th) for leaking state secrets, Pakistani media reported.

It is his second conviction in recent months and comes just 10 days before the country's general election. Former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi was also sentenced to 10 years.

The case pertains to allegations that Khan had made public the contents of a secret cable sent by the country's ambassador in Washington to the government in Islamabad.

Khan was previously sentenced to three years in a corruption case. While his jail term was suspended as he challenged the corruption conviction, it has already ruled him out of the country's general elections which are scheduled for next week.

Khan has been fighting dozens of cases since he was ousted from power in a parliamentary vote of no confidence in 2022.
