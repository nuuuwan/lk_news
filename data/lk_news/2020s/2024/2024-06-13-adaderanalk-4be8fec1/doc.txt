Overseas travel ban on Perpetual Treasuries Chairman temporarily lifted

The Colombo High Court has temporarily lifted the overseas travel ban imposed on the Chairman of Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) Geoffrey Aloysius, said Ada Derana reporter.

This order was issued when the relevant case was taken up before a three-member judge panel comprising Justices Amal Perera, Naml Balalle and Adithya Patabendige today (13).

Geoffrey Aloysius, the sixth defendant of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka bond scam case, was allowed to travel overseas for his medical treatments in Malaysia accordingly. The travel ban suspension is effective from June 1 to September 12.

Meanwhile, the court has also ordered to communicate the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration that the relevant overseas travel ban has been temporarily lifted.
