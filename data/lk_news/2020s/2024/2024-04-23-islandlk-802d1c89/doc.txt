Thaala Bentota spearheads sustainable efforts in conserving endangered Ratha Milla mangrove species

Thaala Bentota Resort by Browns Hotels & Resorts, in collaboration with the Department of Wildlife Conservation, recently unveiled a unique conservation initiative aimed at safeguarding Bentota’s vital mangrove ecosystem. The program aims to focus on the Ratha Milla plant (Lumnitzera littorea), a critically endangered true mangrove species native to Sri Lanka.

The Ratha Milla mangrove, previously thought to be limited to the Madu River Ramsar until recently, has now been rediscovered in the Bentota estuary and the Dedduwa lagoon area, with over 100 young plants aged between 10 to 20 years, where it was last recorded a century ago.

A series of informative signs were unveiled at the Bentota mangrove site on the 4th of April to raise awareness amongst visitors on the significance of this distinct ecosystem. The Thaala Bentota team, led by Channa Ekanayake, General Manager of the property, hosted an education and awareness session at the Bentota Dewapriya Rama Temple, bringing together tourists, officials from the Department of Wildlife Conservation and the local community. The discussion highlighted the importance of mangroves around the coastal areas and the need to preserve the critically endangered Ratha Milla plant while mitigating numerous threats to its survival. The program additionally emphasised the need to foster a deeper appreciation for local biodiversity and its ecological importance.

“We are optimistic that this initiative will provide crucial support for the regeneration of the Ratha Milla mangrove species. Through our collaboration with the Department of Wildlife Conservation, we are committed to making a tangible difference in securing the long-term viability of these invaluable ecosystems. Through continued efforts and community involvement, we can work towards a sustainable future where mangroves thrive for generations to come” said Eksath Wijeratne, CEO of Browns Hotels & Resorts.

“The mangroves in Bentota serve as the backbone of our coastal ecosystem, essential for preserving biodiversity and shielding coastal communities from the ravages of climate change. The recent discovery of the Ratha Milla mangrove population presents an invaluable opportunity for seed propagation and advancing conservation endeavors. Through our partnership with Thaala Bentota Resort, our primary objective is to mitigate human-induced threats through educational initiatives” stated Asanka Gunawardane – Head of Marine Division, Hikkaduwa, Department of Wildlife Conservation.
