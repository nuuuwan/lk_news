Freight container transport charges reduced

The All-Island United Container Transport Owners’ Association says container transportation charges have been decreased by 4 percent, with effect from midnight yesterday (01 Oct).

The president of the Association, Sanath Manjula stated that the decision comes in response to the government’s recent reduction in Auto Diesel prices by Rs. 24, following an earlier reduction of Rs. 10.

The association has decided to decrease the import and export freight container transport charges by 4 percent, in line with the fuel prices, he said.

“Currently, the government is working to provide relief to the entire public. Accordingly, our executive committee decided to lower the container transport charges,” said the president of the association.
