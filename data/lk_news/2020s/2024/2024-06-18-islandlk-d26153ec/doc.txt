The Gift of Life this Vesak: AIA Insurance brings clean water to Kimbulpatiyawa

This Vesak, AIA Insurance, presented the greatest gift of life to the villagers of Kimbulpatiyawa, Anuradhapura which is clean and safe drinking water. Recognizing that clean water is the essence of life and a fundamental human necessity, AIA Insurance implemented a water purification system in this rural community. This significant initiative is part of their enduring commitment to help all Sri Lankans live healthier, longer, better lives.

Water is more than a natural resource; it is the foundation of health, wellbeing and prosperity. For the 300 families, approximately 1500 individuals and a primary school with 75 students in Kimbulpatiyawa, access to clean water has been a long-awaited dream. The lack of this vital resource had not only impacted their daily lives but also hindered their ability to celebrate Vesak, one of Sri Lanka’s most important religious festivals. Vesak holds profound spiritual significance for the people of Kimbulpatiyawa. However, without clean water, traditional celebrations, including organizing ‘dansal’ for spiritual blessings, had been difficult to conduct. This year, AIA Insurance changed that narrative by installing a water purification system, enabling the villagers to celebrate Vesak to its fullest and ensuring clean water for everyday use.

“We believe that clean water is the gift of life and a basic human right,” said Sasith Bambaradeniya, Chief Marketing Officer at AIA Insurance. “Our goal is to enhance the quality of life for the residents of Kimbulpatiyawa, which allowed them to celebrate Vesak with dignity and joy, and to support their overall health and wellbeing long into the future. This initiative is a part of AIA Insurance’s ongoing mission to help all Sri Lankans live healthier, longer, better lives. The newly installed water purification system is a testament to our commitment to the communities we serve, providing a sustainable solution that will benefit current and future generations in Kimbulpatiyawa.”
