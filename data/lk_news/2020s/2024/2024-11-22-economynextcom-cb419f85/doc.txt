Sri Lanka’s Dipped Products buys Thailand-based rubber glove factory

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Dipped Products Plc said it had acquired 100 percent of the equity of Hi Care Thai Gloves Company Ltd in Thailand for 11 million US dollars.

“This strategic acquisition aligns with the Company’s objectives to expand its global footprint in the rubber glove manufacturing industry and strengthen its presence in international markets,” Dipped Products said in a stock exchange filing.
