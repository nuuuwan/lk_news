Elpitiya PS Election: Voter’s thumb to be marked instead of little finger

The Election Commission has announced a key measure for the upcoming Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha election scheduled for October 26, 2024.

In accordance with Section 53a(3) of the Local Government Elections Ordinance (262nd Authority), voters will have their left thumb marked with an appropriate sign to prevent double voting and ensure transparency, the election regulatory body said today (17).

This decision comes in light of concerns about possible confusion during the polling process for the Presidential Election 2024, which took place recently.

Meanwhile, if a voter’s left thumb is unavailable, the mark will be applied to the thumb of the right hand, or if necessary, another finger, as suitable, according to the Election Commission.
