Sri Lanka president to implement subsidy schemes of predecessor halted by election commission

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s new president Anura Dissanayake has instructed the treasury to provide an allowance of 25,000 rupees per hectare to paddy farmers for the Maha season of 2024/25.

The subsidy will be deposited to farmers bank accounts starting October 1, the president’s media division said.

Dissanayake  also directed the treasury to implement a fuel subsidy for the fishing community, effective October 1.

This will be available on a monthly basis for both multi-day and one-day fishing vessels, and also be deposited into fishermen’s bank accounts.

Former minister Kanchana Wijesekera said “It’s good to see that schemes approved, allocated funds through the treasury and initiated by President @RW_SRILANKA that was stopped by the election commission during the Presidential election recommencing under President @anuradisanayake.”

The subsidy schemes were introduced as the previous government’s policy decisions in August 2024 with the allocation of funds through the treasury.

All programs were put on hold by the Election Commission ahead of the Presidential Election, but are now allowed to proceed ahead of Sri Lanka’s General Election scheduled to be held on November 14.

Dissanayake’s National People’s Power is seeking a two-thirds majority in parliament after he was elected with only 42.31 percent of the vote. (Colombo/Sep27/2024)
