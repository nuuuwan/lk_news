GMOA raises concerns over establishment of medicine faculty at NSBM

Colombo, March 13 (Daily Mirror) -Â  On the heels of the cabinet nod to establish a medical faculty at the National School of Business Management (NSBM), the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has expressed reservations, questioning the necessity of the move as it appears unrealistic.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe emphasized the importance of conducting a proper feasibility study before making a final decision.

"As Sri Lanka is renowned for upholding competitive and high standards in medical education, it is imperative to consider the potential loopholes that could hinder local competitiveness when establishing new faculties of this nature," he pointed out.

As such, Dr. Wijesinghe stressed that health authorities must ensure that standards are not compromised with the establishment of the new faculty.

"Furthermore, the authorities must outline their plans regarding the number of doctors they intend to produce in the next ten years. However, the health ministry seems to lack such a strategic plan," he alleged.

According to the latest A/L intake, a total of 2084 students were enrolled in medical faculties in Sri Lanka, with the Colombo University having the highest enrollment, Dr. Wijesinghe raised questions about the necessity for new production.

"Failure to consider these factors could lead to the Medicine Faculty at NSBM becoming the next SAITM," Dr. Wijesinghe added.

Meanwhile, the GMOA urged the Health Ministry to prioritize addressing the issues faced by medical faculties at state universities before establishing new ones.

When inquired from the Health Ministry, a senior official stated that the move to establish a new medical faculty is still under discussion and the final decision will be reached following consultations with relevant stakeholders, including the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
