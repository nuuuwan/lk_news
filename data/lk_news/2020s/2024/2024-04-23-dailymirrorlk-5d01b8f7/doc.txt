Temperature rises to ’Caution’ level

Colombo, April 23 (Daily Mirror) -  The Meteorology Department issued a cautionary warning today about escalating temperatures that may be particularly intense for people across the country except in Matale, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya and Badulla.

They said the heat index, a measure of how hot it feels to the human body when relative humidity is factored in with the actual air temperature, is anticipated to escalate to levels classified as 'Caution'.

According to the heat advisory issued, the 'Caution Level' was expected in 22 districts, which include the Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Mannar, Trincomalee, Vavuniya, Anuradhapura, Puttalam, Polonnaruwa, Kurunegala, Gampaha, Kegalle, Ampara, Colombo, Kalutara, Ratnapura, Galle, Matara, Hambantota, Moneragala, Batticaloa and Ampara districts.

This poses potential health risks, especially to vulnerable populations such as the elderly, children and individuals with pre-existing health conditions.

As such, people are advised to prioritize hydration and take frequent breaks in shaded areas to prevent heat-related illnesses.

People are also advised to wear lightweight, loose-fitting and light-coloured clothing to help stay cool in the sweltering conditions.

Furthermore, individuals engaging in outdoor activities are encouraged to limit strenuous exertion, seek shade whenever possible and stay adequately hydrated.
