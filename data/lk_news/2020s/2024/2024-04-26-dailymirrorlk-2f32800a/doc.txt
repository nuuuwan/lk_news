Iranian Embassy refused appointment for Sajith to meet Iranian President: Nalin Bandara

Parliament, April 26 (Daily Mirror)-Â Refuting reports that Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa avoided meeting visiting Iranian President Dr. Ebrahim Raisi, SJB MP Nalin Bandara said today that Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa did not get an appointment from the Iranian Embassy to meet the Iranian President.

He told Parliament that Sajith Premadasa did not attend the dinner with the Iranian President hosted by President Ranil Wickremesinghe as he never attends dinners hosted by President Wickremesinghe.

"I must correct the incorrect reports claiming that the Samagi Jana Balawegaya did not meet the Iranian President. Our leader did not get the appointment from the Iranian Embassy to meet the Iranian President. We did not attend the dinner as Sajith Premadasa never attends dinners hosted by Ranil Wickremesinghe," he said.
