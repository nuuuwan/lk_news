New Book: After Assad: Is Syria the New Libya in the Mediterranean?

“After Assad: Is Syria the New Libya in the Mediterranean?” is a sharp and unflinching analysis of Syria’s descent into chaos. Journalist Nilantha Ilangamuwa examines the aftermath of Bashar al-Assad’s fall, highlighting the complex web of foreign interventions, regional ambitions, and internal fractures that have ravaged the country.

The author reflects on his personal experiences with Syrian journalists, politicians, and activists, noting the stark contrast between the prosperous cities and the war-torn regions of the Middle East. He writes, “If you travel at night from Tehran to Doha, one side sparkles with lights, the other is cloaked in darkness, a symbol of neglect and conflict.”

The book draws chilling parallels between post-Assad Syria and Libya after Gaddafi’s collapse, pointing to looting, territorial gains, and military interventions as signs of Syria’s uncertain future. The author critiques foreign powers, including Turkey’s ambitions to undermine Kurdish autonomy and Israel’s actions in the Golan Heights, framing Syria as the epicentre of competing geopolitical interests.

The book also examines internal struggles that exacerbate Syria’s plight. The rise of extremist factions like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the fracturing of opposition forces, and the manipulation of local conflicts by external actors are portrayed as symptoms of a deeper malaise. “What began as a cry for dignity and justice has now devolved into a battleground for dominance,” the author observes, driving home the tragic irony of Syria’s uprising. The 114-page book is available on Amazon (https://a.co/d/0CJlhDx). After Assad is an indispensable resource for anyone seeking to understand the complexities of post-Assad Syria. It is a masterfully written, deeply thought-provoking work that demands to be read and reckoned with.
