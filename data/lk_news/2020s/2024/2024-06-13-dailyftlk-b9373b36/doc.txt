Election delay would end UNP: MR

Emphasises polls cannot be postponed according to constitution and any such attempt would be foolish

Assures SLPP remains strong despite defections and people are supportive of an SLPP victory

Claims public is focused on ensuring an SLPP and has little interest in other parties

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has warned that attempting to postpone upcoming elections would only spell the end of the United National Party (UNP).

Responding to questions posed by the media in Badulla on Tuesday, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) leader said elections cannot be postponed according to the constitution. “Any attempt to delay polls will mark the end of the UNP,” he said.

Rajapaksa also asserted that the country’s people remain hopeful about the SLPP and that defections have not weakened the party.

“We are stronger today than we were before. The election cannot be postponed according to the constitution, and we cannot proceed without it. I don’t think the UNP will make such a foolish move,” he said. “At this moment, we have not announced anything about our Presidential candidate. We will reveal our candidate at the appropriate time,” Rajapaksa said.

According to him, the country’s people are eager to ensure the victory of the Pohottuwa (SLPP). “They are not interested in other parties,” he said.
