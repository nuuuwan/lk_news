Free Trade Zone Manufacturers’ congratulates AKD

The Executive Committee and members of the Free Trade Zone Manufacturers’ Association (FTZMA) have extended their heartfelt congratulations to the newly elected President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

They said his significant victory was a true reflection of the majority’s trust in him during the recent Presidential election and the historic win demonstrates the people’s urgent desire for democratic change and new leadership.

The FTZMA recalled the productive and fruitful interaction Dissanayake had with its Executive Members on 17 August 2023. “We eagerly anticipate close collaboration with you, as our new President, and with the Government to reinforce disciplined and effective work practices in all Government institutions, including the Board of Investment (BOI), through progressive fiscal policies aimed at attracting increased Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) into the country,” said FTZMA Chairman Dhammika Fernando and Hon. Secretary Tyronne Weckasinghe in their congratulatory letter to President Dissanayake.

“Your vision for creating a fair, just, and inclusive society, focused on eradicating corruption and improving living standards, aligns with our belief that your dedication to good governance and sustainable economic development will lead to gradual and systematic progress for the country in the coming years. We are fully committed to support your Government in achieving these goals at all times,” it added.
