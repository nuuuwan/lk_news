ITAK’s General Secretary nominated for National List seat

The Ilankai Thamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) has nominated its General Secretary Dr. P. Sathiyalingam to enter the Parliament as the party’s National List MP.

Dr. P. Sathiyalingam contested the 2024 General Election from the Vanni District representing the ITAK, however, was not able to secure a seat through the preference votes as ITAK managed to secure only one seat in the district.

Accordingly, Dr. P. Sathiyalingam will enter the Parliament through the only national list seat secured by ITAK.
