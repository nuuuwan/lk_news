Corporate and donor support propels HelpAge Sri Lanka Eye Hospital to 50,000 free cataract surgeries milestone

HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL) celebrated a significant milestone with the completion of 50,000 free cataract surgeries at the HelpAge Eye Hospital. This achievement underscores the extraordinary support from corporate sponsors, donors, and philanthropists, whose generous contributions made this lifesaving initiative possible.

To celebrate this achievement, a special event was held at the HelpAge Eye Hospital, located at Sinsapa Road, Wellawatte, Colombo 6, the only charitable facility in the country providing such vital services. The event featured the Minister of Health, Dr. Ramesh Pathirana, as the Chief Guest, alongside Ministry Secretary Dr. Palitha Mahipala, former Health Secretary Dr. Amal Harsha De Silva, HASL council members, donors, beneficiaries, and hospital staff.

Speaking at the milestone event, Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana emphasized the crucial role of collaborative efforts in supporting the healthcare needs of Sri Lanka’s aging population. “Sri Lanka has one of the highest proportions of elderly populations in the world, and addressing their health needs, particularly vision restoration, is crucial.”

Minister Pathirana further highlighted the broader context, stating, “Since 1990, Sri Lanka has faced significant challenges with its aging population, including high rates of mental and emotional distress, suicide, high blood pressure, diabetes, and cancer. It is truly commendable that organizations like HelpAge Sri Lanka have stepped in to elevate the lives of the elderly. The Government is making concerted efforts to address these healthcare needs, and Sri Lanka is one of the few countries in the world where healthcare is provided free of charge. Organizations like HelpAge Sri Lanka play a crucial role in these overall efforts, addressing critical needs in elderly care. Their work in health, mental, social, and economic well-being, particularly in vision impairments, deserves high appreciation.”

Minister Pathirana assured continued support from the Health Ministry for HelpAge Sri Lanka’s mission, emphasizing the importance of collaboration between the government and the private sector in enhancing healthcare services for the elderly.

The event, featured the unveiling of a commemorative plaque by Minister Pathirana and testimonials from several cataract beneficiaries who shared their emotional stories of regaining independence, dignity, and livelihood following their surgeries. A special citation was read at the ceremony to appreciate the donors, both past and present, for their invaluable contributions and for being instrumental in HelpAge’s transformative journey towards enhancing the vision and well-being of the elderly. Certificates of appreciation were also presented to both past and current doctors, as well as the entire hospital team, in recognition of their exceptional service. Additionally, certificates and cash awards were given to acknowledge their dedicated contributions.

HelpAge Sri Lanka Chairman, Deshabandu Tilak De Zoysa, said, “The completion of over 50,000 cataract surgeries is not just a numerical milestone; it signifies the restoration of independence and dignity to countless elderly individuals. Corporate philanthropy and the generosity of individual donors have been pivotal in achieving this milestone.”

He acknowledged with gratitude the late Damascene Perera for donating the land for the hospital, following an appeal made by him, and HelpAge International UK, represented by CEO Richard Blewitt, for their foundational support. Additionally, he expressed thanks to Counsel Member Dr. Champa Banagala for overseeing the hospital’s activities.

Dr. Banagala speaking on the occasion said that due to poverty, many Sri Lankans avoid seeking eye care. However, HelpAge Sri Lanka’s mobile service program now reaches remote areas, screening patients and providing necessary cataract surgeries. “An MOU with the Ministry of Health, along with support from the College of Ophthalmologists, facilitates these operations in their hospitals. All of these initiatives are funded by HelpAge Sri Lanka,” she said.

Executive Director of HASL, Samantha Liyanawaduge, highlighted the critical role of donor contributions in reaching this milestone. “Your support has enabled us to make a profound impact on the lives of senior citizens in need,” he stated.

Since its establishment in 1986, HelpAge Sri Lanka has conducted 3,306 mobile medical and eye camps, served 388,416 beneficiaries, and donated 239,622 bifocal spectacles. The organization has also trained 45,000 youths under the HelpAge Home Care Assistant Training Programs and conducted Senior Citizens’ Capacity Building Training Programs with over 60,000 participants.
