LIOC begins retailing 100 octane petrol in Sri Lanka

ECONOMYNEXT – Lanka Indian Oil Company began selling a 100 octane premium petrol product in the Sri Lanka market on Tuesday, the island nation’s Minister of Power and Energy said.

Chairman of Lanka IOC and the senior management met the minister earlier this week.

“We discussed the development plans of the retail outlet network of LIOC, tank farm development, lubricant market, fuel pricing formula and the proposed oil pipeline between India and Sri Lanka,” Kanchana Wijesekera said on X (twitter).

After this month’s price revision, octane 92 petrol sells at 344 rupees a litre, and octane 95 petrol was at 379 rupees.

Higher octane fuel is mostly used in high-performance engines. (Colombo/Jul3/2024)
