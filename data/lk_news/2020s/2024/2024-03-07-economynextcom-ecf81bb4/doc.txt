Sri Lanka considering nuclear power as an energy option: Min

ECONOMYNEXT- Sri Lanka’s government is considering nuclear power as an option and has secured Cabinet approval, Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera said.

“We are in the process of calling EOIs, so we are evaluating certain things,” Wijesekara said at a press briefing on Thursday.

Wijesekera said that in order to develop nuclear power, a legal framework must be put in place as well as plans on dealing with an emergency.

“We have got the cabinet approval to call for EOIs from suitable investors to establish a nuclear power plant in Sri Lanka, but before you establish a nuclear power plant there are certain legal frameworks required by global agencies.

“There are certain criteria that we need to fulfil so we are in the process of doing that.”

In November 2023, Wijesekara told parliament that several countries including Russia, France and the United States had offered to collaborate with Sri Lanka on nuclear technology.

Wijesekara said Sri Lanka required international assistance to evaluate the technology that is best suited for the country.

“Nuclear power plant takes a minimum of 4 years to construct – some countries have taken 14-15 years to do it. If we start now we will have the power plant ready and the framework ready. What the government wants is to have nuclear power as an option,” Wijesekera said. (Colombo/Mar7/2024)
