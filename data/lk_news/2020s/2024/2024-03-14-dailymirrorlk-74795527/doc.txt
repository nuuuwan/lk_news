Water levels in Castlereagh, Maussakale dropping rapidly

Due to the extremely dry weather prevailing in the western slopes of the Central hills, the water level in Castlereagh and Maussakale reservoirs is dropping rapidly, Engineers in charge of these reservoirs said.

Reservoir engineers claimed that by 6 a.m., today the water level of the Castlereagh reservoir had dropped by 25 feet from the overflow level, and the water level of the Maussakale reservoir had dropped by 23 feet from the overflow level.

Although the water level of both the reservoirs has dropped rapidly, the hydroelectric power plant engineers said that there is currently no obstacle to the daily hydropower generation.
