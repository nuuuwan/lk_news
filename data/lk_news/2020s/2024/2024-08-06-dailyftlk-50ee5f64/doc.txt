Trade Minister Nalin Fernando met with New Zealand High Commissioner David Pine yesterday at the Trade Ministry premises.

In this regard, the High Commissioner actively engaged in creating connections between the relevant stakeholders in the two countries he further added.

During the meeting, the High Commissioner stated that Sri Lanka and New Zealand need further partnership not only in the tourism sector but also in the areas of Trade, Sports,Dairy Industry, Education, and Cultural sectors. The High Commissioner also said that among migrants to New Zealand from around the world, it is significant that all Sri Lankans are highly skilled people. Considering the ways to enhance Sri Lanka-New Zealand trade relations, the High Commissioner emphasised the need to develop identified Sri Lankan products to target sophisticated international markets, including small populations like New Zealand. Both sides discussed working towards further strengthening the existing relations.
