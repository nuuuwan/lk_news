Luminex gets cleaning project of Kankasanthurei cement factory

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved awarding the project for cleaning and collecting iron and other metal parts scattered in the Kankasanthurei cement factory complex to Luminex PLC.

The move follows a national competitive procurement methodology, with bids called under the direct supervision of the Ministry of Industries.

“Six bidders submitted their proposals for this procurement, but three were disqualified based on the bid documents. After thorough evaluation, the contract was awarded to Luminex PLC, the substantially responsive bidder deemed eligible according to the recommendations of the procurement committee appointed by the Cabinet of Ministers,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said yesterday.

Speaking at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday, he said the decision marks a significant step toward revitalising the factory complex and ensuring efficient cleanup operations.

The proposal to this effect submitted by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as the Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies Minister was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
