Women Parliamentarians’ Caucus expresses concern on reducing consent age for sex

Parliament, March 22 (Daily Mirror)- The Women Parliamentarians’ Caucus has requested Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe to take steps to withdraw the bill gazetted to amend Chapter 19 of the Penal Code which seeks to reduce the consent age for sex to 14.

"According to the amendments made to the Penal Code in 1995, even if a girl under 16 years of age has sexual relations of her own free will, it is considered rape and the proposed amendment to the Penal Code by the Minister of Justice will lower the age limit to 14 years," the Caucus said.

The Chair of the Women Parliamentarians' Caucus Sudarshini Fernandopulle said that she requested on behalf of the Women Parliamentarians’ Caucus to withdraw the proposed bill to amend Section 364 of the Penal Code.

She also requested to prioritise the protection of women and children and uphold the justice for vulnerable population in Sri Lanka.

Ms. Fernandopulle further informs in her letter that her Caucus is ready to discuss further information or alternative proposals in this regard at any time.
