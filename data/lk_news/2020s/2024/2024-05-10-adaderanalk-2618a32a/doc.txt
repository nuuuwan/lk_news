Mujibur Rahman to take oath as Member of Parliament today

Mujibur Rahman of the ‘Samagi Jana Balawegaya’ (SJB) is scheduled to be sworn in as a Member of Parliament today (10).

In response to an inquiry from Ada Derana, he confirmed that the swearing-in ceremony is slated to take place after the Parliament convenes at 9:30 am this morning.

The ‘Samagi Jana Balawegaya’ (SJB) party has decided to nominate former Member of Parliament Mujibur Rahman to fill the National List MP position left vacant by the disqualification of former State Minister Diana Gamage from holding a parliamentary seat.

However, the Sri Lanka Women Parliamentarians’ Caucus has called for the appointment of a suitable woman to fill Diana Gamage’s vacant seat.

The Parliamentary Communications Department reported that its Chairperson, Member of Parliament Dr. Sudarshani Fernandopulle, has sent a letter to the General Secretary of the SJB, Mr. Ranjith Madduma Bandara, in this regard.

A Gazette notification was issued last evening stating that Mujibur Rahman has been nominated by the SJB to fill the vacancy in Parliament created by the disqualification of Diana Gamage as Member of Parliament by a Supreme Court verdict.

Accordingly, the Election Commission, acting under section 64(5) of the Parliamentary Elections Act, No. 1 of 1981 read with provisions of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, has announced that Mohamad Mujibur Rahman was declared elected as a Member of Parliament to fill the vacancy created due to the determination of the Supreme Court cancelling the parliamentary membership of Diana Gamage aforesaid.

The Secretary-General of Parliament informed the Election Commission that a Parliamentary seat in the Ninth Parliament has become vacant from 08 May 2024, due to the cancellation of parliamentary seat of Member of Parliament Diana Gamage.

This was formally conveyed to the Chairman of the Election Commission in writing, pursuant to Section 64(1) of Parliamentary Elections Act No.01 of 1981.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday (May 08) declared that State Minister Diana Gamage is not legally qualified to hold a parliamentary seat.
