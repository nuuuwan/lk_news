Fund established to provide financial aid for police personnel facing legal issues related to duties

Inspector General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon has approved to provide financial aid to police personnel facing legal issues pertaining to actions taken while performing their duties.

Accordingly, Police Spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa stated that relevant funds will be provided by the ‘Police Legal Assistance Fund’.

A proposal in this regard was presented before the Cabinet of Ministers in July 2022 by the Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles, and was subsequently approved.

Accordingly, the newly-appointed IGP has approved to provide legal aid to said police officers from the Police Legal Assistance Fund.

The main objective of the fund is to provide some financial relief to police personnel facing economic hardships for obtaining private legal assistance and other legal services in cases where an officer is subject to any legal action related to the actions carried out within the scope of duty and when the Attorney General’s Department refuses to provide state legal assistance or does not provide legal assistance in relation to it.
