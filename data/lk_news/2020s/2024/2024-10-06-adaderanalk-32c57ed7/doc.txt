IRD collects over 70% of 2024 tax revenue target

The Inland Revenue Department has successfully collected Rs. 1,417 billion in taxes as of September 30, 2024, surpassing 70% of the annual revenue target of Rs. 2,024 billion.

In a statement, the Commissioner General of the Department of Inland Revenue Sepalika Chandrasekara noted that while the collection progress is commendable, there are still outstanding taxes owed by certain taxpayers under the self-assessment payment system.

She mentioned that beginning today (06), the department will conduct visits to the premises of these taxpayers to ensure prompt collection of dues.

“Moving forward, we will enforce the collection of unpaid self-assessment taxes through the appropriate legal procedures,” said Chandrasekara.
