Support for Sri Lanka president grew in May but remained far behind rivals: poll

ECONOMYNEXT — Support for President Ranil Wickremesinghe increased to 15 percent in May, though support for his two main rivals remained significantly higher at just under 40 percent for each in an independent voting-intent survey.

The Sri Lanka Opinion Tracker Survey (SLOTS) carried out by the Institute for Health Policy (IHP) found that 39 percent of the adults surveyed had expressed support for leftist National People’s Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake at the upcoming presidential election. This was a drop of two percentage points from April. Support for opposition leader Sajith Premadasa remained unchanged at 38 percent. President Wickremesinghe gained three percentage points, with support for him increasing to 15 percent. Meanwhile, support for a generic candidate from the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) was found to be 7 percent.

IHP said in a statement that these estimates use the IHP SLOTS Multilevel Regression and Poststratification (MRP) model (01/2024 revision).

“This update is for all adults and uses data from 17,751 interviews conducted from October 2021 to 24 June 2024, including 503 interviews in May 2024. One hundred bootstraps were run to capture model uncertainty. Margins of error are assessed as 1–4 percent for May,” the institute said in a statement on Thursday July 04.

According to IHP, its SLOTS MRP methodology first estimates the relationship between a wide variety of characteristics about respondents and their opinions – in this case, ‘If there was a Presidential Election today, who would you vote for?’– in a multilevel statistical model that also smooths month to month changes. It then uses a large data file that is calibrated to the national population to predict voting intent in each month since October 2021, according to what the multilevel model says about their probability of voting for various parties (‘post-stratification’) at each point in time.

The institute said that the multilevel model was estimated 100 times to reflect underlying uncertainties in the model and to obtain margins of error. The voting intent results for previous months have changed in this update as more data were collected after the last release and these changes are within the margin of error. (Colombo/Jul04/2024)
