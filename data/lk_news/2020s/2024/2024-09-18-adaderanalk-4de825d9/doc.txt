Namal ready to prove innocence of Rajapaksa govt

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) presidential candidate, MP Namal Rajapaksa stated that he is prepared to prove the innocence of the ‘Rajapaksa government’.

He made these comments while addressing a public rally held in the Kotikawatta area yesterday (17).

“We didn’t carelessly build roads or housing apartments. We also didn’t bring in investors carelessly. We had a plan and a vision to develop this nation. We accountable for every investment made”, he added.

Namal Rajapaksa further stated that if anyone claims that they stole or engaged in corruption, they are prepared to face any international court to prove their innocence. He also stated that in the past they were questioned about their inability to face the elections after the ‘Aragalaya’ movement.

“There may be a different understanding about us. There may be a wrong opinion, but we have the strength to come before the people and ask them to vote for us,” he said.

Rajapaksa said that they possess that self-confidence because they are innocent and due to the political environment they were raised in. “That’s why I’m saying that I love challenges. I also love the challenge of building this country and securing your child’s life. I will win that challenge, “he added.
