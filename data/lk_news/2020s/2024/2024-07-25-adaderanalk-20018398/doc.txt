Showery conditions expected to enhance in next few days

The Meteorology Department says showery conditions are expected to enhance to some extent in the south-western part of the Island from tomorrow (26) in the next few days.

Several spells of showers will occur in Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces and in Kandy, Nuwara-Eliya, Galle and Matara districts while a few showers may occur in the North-western province.

Strong winds of about 50 kmph can be expected at times over Western slopes of the central hills and in Northern, North-central and North-western provinces and in Trincomalee, Monaragala and Hambantota districts.

Fairly strong winds of about 30-40 kmph can be expected at times elsewhere of the island, it said.
