Sri Lanka sees foreign inflows into govt securities for fifth straight week

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka saw foreign inflows into its government securities for the fifth straight week ended on October 16, the Central Bank data showed.

However, foreign exchange analysts said the demand for rupee-denominated government securities has slowed after yields fell last week.

Sri Lanka witnessed 495 million rupees ($1,7 million at 1 US dollar = 295 LKR)  inflow into government securities in the week ended on October 16, but much lower than the previous week’s inflow of 6.9 billion rupees (($23.4 mln), the official data showed.

The value of government securities held by foreign investors and funds was at 51,142 million rupees last week.

“The yields were down and foreign investor appetite was low,” a currency dealer told EconomyNext.

Analysts say Sri Lanka’s deflationary policies have helped to see inflows amid lowering market lending rates and appreciation in the rupee currency with curtailed imports.

The island nation saw an inflow of 4.4 billion rupees ($14.9 mln) in the week ended on October 3.

The country, however, saw an inflow of only 14 million rupees in the two weeks ended on September 26 amid the presidential election.

The new inflows also come after Sri Lanka witnessed a peaceful presidential election that elected Marxists Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake as the island nation’s president for a five-year tenure.

Sri Lanka, however, has suffered a foreign outflow of 66 percent or 78.1 billion rupees worth government securities in the first nine months of the year. (Colombo/October 21/2024)
