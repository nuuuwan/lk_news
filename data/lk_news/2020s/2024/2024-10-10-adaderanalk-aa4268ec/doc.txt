Weather alert issued for heavy rainfall above 150mm

The Department of Meteorology has issued a ‘Color: Red’ warning for heavy rainfall in the Western, Sabaragamuwa and North-western provinces and in Galle and Matara districts, in the next 24 hours.

Showery conditions are expected to enhance to some extent in the south-western part of the Island in the next few days starting from today (10), due to the development of atmospheric disturbance in the vicinity of Sri Lanka.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern and North-western provinces, it said.

Very heavy showers above 150mm are likely at some places in Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces and in Galle and Matara districts.

Showers or thundershowers will occur elsewhere at several places in the island during the evening or night.

The general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
