CIPM Sri Lanka launches “Ten Leadership Virtues (Dasa Raja Dharma)”: Bridging ancient wisdom with modern leadership

On June 11th, 2024, the Chartered Institute of Personnel Management (CIPM) Sri Lanka unveiled a pioneering initiative, “Ten Leadership Virtues (Dasa Raja Dharma): Ancient Wisdom for Modern Leadership,” at the CIPM Auditorium. This project aims to rejuvenate leadership practices by integrating the ancient Buddhist principles of Dasaraja Dharma, known as the Ten Kingly Virtues.

The event was graced by the esteemed presence of the Chief Guest, Ken Vijayakumar, President of CIPM Sri Lanka, and Vice President, Priyantha Ranasinghe, Hony. Secretary Col. Saman Jayawickrama, CEO U A C Obeyesekere, Director of Professional and Academic Affairs G. Weerathunga, Dr Yashoda Bandara from Rajarata University, and Dr Rasika Priyankara from Sabaragamuwa University. These distinguished individuals highlighted the significance of integrating ethical leadership frameworks into contemporary management practices.

Dr Yashoda Bandara and Dr Rasika Priyankara, who conducted the research and contributed to the project, emphasised the importance of Dasaraja Dharma, which includes virtues such as generosity, morality, sacrifice, honesty, gentleness, austerity, non-anger, non-violence, patience, and non-opposition. These values form a robust foundation for cultivating leaders dedicated to integrity, accountability, and the common good.

CIPM’s President, Ken Vijayakumar, envisions this initiative as a transformative catalyst for positive change. By embedding the timeless principles of Dasaraja Dharma into modern leadership, CIPM aims to foster a new generation of ethical and effective leaders. This approach addresses contemporary leadership deficiencies and aligns management models with Sri Lankan cultural and ethical values.

The initiative holds immense potential for the Human Resource Management (HRM) field. CIPM is poised to elevate leaders’ ethical standards and effectiveness across various sectors by developing a comprehensive leadership model based on these principles. This initiative promises to provide invaluable resources and training programs for CIPM students and members, encouraging the integration of religious philosophies, including Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam, into modern management practices. This approach fosters social-religious harmony and contributes to national development.

CIPM requests that members, students, and researchers explore the ancient wisdom embedded in various religious philosophies to benefit both the country and the world. By doing so, we can uncover and apply timeless principles that enhance leadership and management practices in contemporary settings.

In an era of widespread corruption and ethical lapses, Dasaraja Dharma’s relevance is profound. By embracing this ancient wisdom, CIPM is paving the way for a more moral and prosperous future for Sri Lanka, ensuring that leaders at all levels are committed to serving the nation with integrity and compassion.
