Sri Lanka to make intervention soon to solve debt problems of industries: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s newly appointed industries minister Sunil Handunetthi said he intended to make an intervention soon to solve capital, debt and raw material problems faced by industries.

“From the Coronavirus crisis period industrialists fell into difficulties and got into a debt crisis,”  Minister Lal Kantha told reporters soon after assuming duties as the Minister of Industries and Enterprise Development.

“Many businesses and industries are now at the point of collapse. There has been parate executions and their property is about to be foreclosed or auctioned.

“Together with national and private banks, the capital, raw material and market problems we hope to make an intervention soon.”

There were attempts to sell institutions because they made losses, with the corruption, bribes and the cut to ministers, he said.

“We will end all that and see,” he said. “If profits cannot be made even after that we will see. Then there must be some other reason. We cannot see that because all this other messes are there.” (Colombo/Sept20/2024)
