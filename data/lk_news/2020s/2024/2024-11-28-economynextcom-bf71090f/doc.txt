Sri Lanka stocks close up, banking shares attract local interest

ECONOMYNEXT – The Colombo Stock Exchange closed up on Thursday, data on its site showed.

The broader ASPI closed up 0.88 percent, or 114.50 points, at 13,164; while the more liquid S&P SL20 Index closed up 1.06 percent, or 41.01 points, at 3,917.

“Now that the government has announced a deadline for the ISB exchange, the banking sector is getting more positive traction, mostly from local investors,” Softlogic Stockbrokers said.

Sampath Bank saw buying interest from local investors, they said.

“Foreign investors are selectively taking positions, they are not that active.

“With the IMF third tranche still pending the global audience is waiting to see the participation rate in the bond exchange.

“If a considerable number are exchanged then they will view it as a success. Once we conclude that we can expect higher foreign participation.”

Local investors, particularly institutions, were taking positions in anticipation of this foreign participation coming in later, they said. “When foreign activity enters prices are likely to improve.”
