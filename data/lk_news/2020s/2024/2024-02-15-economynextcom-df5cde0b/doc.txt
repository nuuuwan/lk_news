Sri Lanka’s Abans hopes to raise 2bn through debenture sale

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Abans Plc, a consumer goods retailer, has said the company is planning to raise up to 2 billion rupees through a debenture sale.

Subject to obtaining all necessary regulatory and shareholder approvals, the company will initially issue ten million rated, unsecured, senior, redeemable debentures of hundred (LKR 100.00) each.

“With the option to issue a further ten million of the said debentures in the event of an oversubscription,” their company secretaries said in a Colombo Stock Exchange filing.

“As such a maximum amount of Rupees Two Billion (LKR 2,000,000,000) would be raised by the issue of a maximum of Twenty Million (20,000,000) Debentures each with a Par Value of LKR 100/-.”

In 2022, amid the country’s foreign exchange shortage, Fitch Ratings cut the company’s rating outlook to ‘negative’ from ‘stable’ due to difficulties in importing. The rating agency confirmed Abans’ ‘AA-(lka)’ rating but said there were risks in next 12-18 months. “Demand for consumer durables is also weakening owing to falling disposable incomes amid high inflation and sharp product price rises impacting affordability.”

The company was founded by Aban Pestonjee as a small corner shop selling used home appliances, and over the last 50 years has emerged as a top electronics retailer. Abans Plc has diversified into financial services, engineering, logistics and real estate. (Colombo/Feb15/2024).
