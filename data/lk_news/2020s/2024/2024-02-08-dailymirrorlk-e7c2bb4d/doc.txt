SJB vies for Indian favor ahead of Presidential Elections following NPP move

Colombo, Feb 8 (Daily Mirror) - Hot on the heels of the National People’s Power (NPP) undertaking a familiarization tour of India with interactions with the top Indian officials, the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has sought a similar opportunity from India, Daily Mirror learns.

The NPP led by its leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake is currently in India on a five –day tour. The NPP leaders have already held talks with Indian External Affairs Minister Dr.S.Jaishankar, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan.

They were supposed to meet Chief Minister of Gujarat Bupendra Patel yesterday. Afterwards, they were expected to arrive in Kerala.

Sensing the political mileage from such engagements in India for a party like the NPP ahead of the presidential election, the SJB has sought a similar visit. According to an informed source, India has responded favourably to the request.

The rivalry between the SJB and the NPP is visible, with both parties vying to outmaneuver each other at every turn. The SJB, in particular, has expressed concern over why the NPP was granted the opportunity to engage with Indian officials first.

As the presidential election draws nearer, the intensity of political maneuvering and strategic alliances is expected to escalate, with both the NPP and the SJB leaving no stone unturned in their quest for victory.
