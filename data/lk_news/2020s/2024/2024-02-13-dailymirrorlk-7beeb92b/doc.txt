No breeze, more heat in Sri Lanka

Colombo, Feb 13 (Daily Mirror) - Declining wind flow in some parts of the country had resulted in people in Western, and Sabaragamuwa and Southern Provinces feeling the heat more than usual, a spokesman from the Department of Meteorology said yesterday.

Deputy Director, Department of Meteorology Merril Mendis told Daily Mirror that the wind flow in the Western Province, Southern and Sabaragamuwa have declined. “Some areas in Sri Lanka are experiencing a declining wind flow. However, the situation in the North and the East is different as there is a fairly heavy wind flow,” he said.

“This is not an unusual phenomenon as this happens during this time of the year. Temperature might increase further during the coming few months and the sun will come directly over Sri Lanka during the first week in April,” he added.

The temperature in Colombo was recorded as 35°C, Katunayake 33°C, Matara 32°C, Kurunegala 31°C, and Ratnapura 31°C as of last afternoon. In contrast, temperatures in Jaffna, Trincomalee, and Mullaitivu were under 30 degrees.
