Sri Lanka Tourism says arrivals to grow after polls, industry wants ETA re-started

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s tourist arrivals are expected to grow after the most peaceful elections in the nation’s history, the island’s tourism promotions office said.

Sri Lanka’s elected President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has prioritized the sector, pledging to unlock its full potential, the statement said.

Visa-free travel for citizens of 39 countries will begin in October, and the tourism industry is optimistic about the reinstatement of the streamlined Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) system pending a court decision, the agency said.

Sri Lanka’s electronic travel authorization system, acclaimed as one of the least hassle free in the world, was hit by a controversy after a consortium involving VFS Global was awarded a processing monopoly without public tender.

Courts ordered the old process to be re-instated, but the Department of Immigration has so far not taken action to re-start the system.

Chalaka Gajabahu, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau said the country was renowned for its beauty, rich cultural heritage and new offerings were being developed.

Priantha Fernando, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority said they were promoting sustainable products which benefits the community and focuses on the development of regional tourism.”

The industry needed help to recover from the financial burden it is currently facing, he said.
