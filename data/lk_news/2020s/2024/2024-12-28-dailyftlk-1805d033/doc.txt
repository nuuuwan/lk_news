Kilinochchi journalist attack suspected retaliation for drug-trade exposé

Kilinochchi-based journalist Murukaiah Thamilchelvan, who narrowly escaped an attempted abduction by a group on Thursday, said that he believes the incident, along with the assault on him, was linked to his ongoing coverage of illicit drug-related issues in the area.

“While returning home on my motorcycle, a cab blocked my path, and its occupants tried to drag me into the vehicle. I managed to escape, but two individuals from the cab severely beat me. I suspect this attack is linked to my reporting on drug-related issues,” he said.

The incident reportedly took place along the A9 road near the Sri Lanka Telecom building in Kilinochchi.

Speaking to the Daily FT, Thamilchelvan said that he could identify one of the attackers, who is believed to have ties to the illicit drug trade in the area.

The journalist received treatment at the Kilinochchi Hospital for injuries sustained in the attack, and the police have recorded his statement.
