The Sri Lankan economy has experienced some positive signs of gradual economic recovery and a measure of stability in macro-economic factors compared to the corresponding period last year, with the appreciation of LKR against USD and the IMF bailout, followed by the domestic and foreign debt optimization announcements made by the Government of Sri Lanka.

The models used regarding collective impairment in 2023 were continued in the 1st half 2024 to ensure that adequate provision buffers were in place to absorb any potential credit risk that could arise in the future. The allowance for overlays applied in 2023 were continued and maintained during 1st half 2024 as well. Meanwhile, the Bank managed to end the 1st half 2024 with healthy credit quality matrices due to improved credit underwriting standards and concerted collection & recovery efforts.

The Bank’s net fee and commission income has increased by 24% during 1st half 2024, mainly due to the increase in fee income generated from loans and advances, due to increased demand for credit which resulted from the prevailing low interest rate regime and other conducive macro-economic factors in the country.

The net gains from trading decreased by 57% during the reporting period due to the drop in capital gains from Sri Lanka Government Rupee Securities (T-Bills/Bonds) classified under FVPL.

The other operating income has increased significantly by 270% due to the prudently managed FX positions with the appreciation of LKR against USD from Rs. 324 to Rs. 306 during 1st half 2024.

The increase in personnel expenses is mainly driven by increased staff salaries, bonuses and allowances. The increase in other operating expenses was contained at 7% due to the effective cost management strategies of the Bank, with the cost increase primarily due to the effect of increased VAT rates from 1st January 2024 onwards and general price increase of goods and services, such as electricity and travelling expenses.
