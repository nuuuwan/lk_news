Established in 1959 as the Institute of Personnel Management Sri Lanka (IPM), it was later rebranded as the Chartered Institute of Personnel Management (CIPM) in 2018. It aims to enhance HR practices in Sri Lanka. Mandated by law, CIPM SL regulates people management practices, holds membership in APFHRM, and is affiliated with WFPMA. Collaborating with the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI), CIPM embarked on creating comprehensive national HRM standards.

Under the visionary leadership of Jayantha Amarasinghe, Immediate Past President of CIPM, National HR Standards were formulated, and the Sectoral Community was established.

Ken Vijayakumar, President of CIPM, highlighted that the newly launched standards will establish a national framework for HRM, ensuring uniformity in practices that elevate quality, consistency, and credibility. Developed through rigorous research, consultations, and validation, these standards offer clear guidelines for HR excellence and self-assessment tools for practitioners and institutions to enhance performance. Aligning HR policies with global benchmarks fosters continuous improvement and innovation while recognising and rewarding HR excellence.
