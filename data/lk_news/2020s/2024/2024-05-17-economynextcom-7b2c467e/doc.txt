Sri Lanka state minister of finance says he received threatening phone call

ECONOMYNEXT — Finance Ministry officials have lodged a complaint with the Fort police about a threatening phone call received at the office of State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe, the state minister said.

Semasinghe told reporters that certain groups may be attempting to jeopardise the government’s ongoing economic reforms.

According to Semasinghe, the caller had said they possessed weapons and had also intimated that, failing to use a weapon, there would be a “burning of some sort”.

We saw in the recent past how certain ideas were expressed that could spread violence,” said Semasinghe.

The state minister also claimed that certain groups were trying to portray Sri Lanka’s ongoing reforms in a negative light.

“Many groups are trying to send out a negative message about the stability in the country. Nobody believed that the economy would strengthened this way under the programme carried out by the president and the government,” he said.

“Nobody can frighten us. Various groups may be trying to somehow prevent this journey and take this country back to the extremely difficult place it was in,” he added.

Semeasinghe had separately said that the economy would not recover for another 15 years iff there was a change in Sri Lanka’s current policy trajectory.

“The president has stated clearly that the presidential election will be held first, followed by the parliamentary and other elections.

“The decisive factor of the next election will be the economy. Strengthening the economy and taking the country forward will receive more attention over what ones wants to hear,” he said.

Disingenuous statements will not count at the election, said Semasinghe.

“If there is a change in the policies that the country is currently on, the economy will collapse and we won’t be able to raise our heads again for another 15 years at least,” he added. (Colombo/May17/2024)
