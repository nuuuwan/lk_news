Absence of defence attaché hinders efforts to nab criminals abroad

The absence of a defence attaché at the Sri Lankan mission in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has dealt a blow to Sri Lanka’s efforts in nabbing organized criminals operating from there, the Daily Mirror learns.

Sri Lanka has ramped up efforts to arrest its criminals hiding overseas - mostly in the UAE.

However, its efforts have been hampered since the absence of a defence attaché.

Asked about the situation, a top diplomatic source said the government would take steps to make necessary appointments to its missions abroad.

Currently, Sri Lanka runs short of 100 diplomats of the approved cadre.

The source said 25 recently recruited diplomats had been referred to the Public Service Commission for approval, but the process had been delayed for more than three months.
