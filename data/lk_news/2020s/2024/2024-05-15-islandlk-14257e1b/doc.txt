Their active engagement in the industries is essential for foster innovation, creativity and overall industry performance. Insufficient funding stands as a primary cause behind the underperforming of youth-led businesses.

Consequently, many youth-led enterprises pursue financing to address their investment and working capital requirements. To bridge this gap, Bank of Ceylon has introduced the BOC Youth concept to develop young entrepreneurs to meet their investment and working capital requirements. Future-focused youth visionaries and entrepreneurs can utilize these low-cost funds to craft new success stories for the country.”
