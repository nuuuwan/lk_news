Sri Lanka to amend criminal code to strengthen laws against sexual assault

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will revise its Penal Code to criminalize sexual harassment, Cabinet Spokesman Minister Bandula Gunawardena said.

“The cabinet has given approval to criminalize sexual harassment including harassment in public places,” Gunawardena told reporters on Wednesday.

“The clearance of the Attorney General has been received for the draft Bill prepared by the Legal Draftsman.”

The draft Bill will be published in the Government Gazette and submitted to Parliament for approval.

Section 345 of Sri Lanka’s Penal Code stipulates a punishment of a maximum prison sentence of two years and/or a fine.

However, sexual violence and harassment is commonplace in Sri Lanka with many cases going unreported. It is estimated that 90 percent of women experience sexual harassment in some form. (Colombo/Jun12/2024)
