Viyathmaga has no connection to Gotabayaâ€™s expulsion: Nalaka Godahewa

Parliament, March 21 (Daily Mirror)- The Viyathmaga had no connection to the economic crisis and the expulsion of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa from office, Parliamentarian Nalaka Godahewa said today.

He told Parliament that the crisis situation was a result of the banning of chemical fertilizer, shortage of gas, the power crisis and depletion of foreign reserves.

The MP said Gotabaya Rajapaksa in his book which was released recently clearly said that former Agriculture Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage had supported him in the implementation of the organic farming policy.

He said the Viyathmaga members who were appointed as Secretaries to the Ministries were against the decisions taken by the President and as a result, four of them were removed.

The MP said this in response to a claim made by Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, who said that the Viyathmaga was behind the faulty decisions taken by Gotabaya Rajapaksa resulting in the expulsion of the then President and the government.
