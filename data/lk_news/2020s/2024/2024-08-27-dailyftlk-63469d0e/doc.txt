Janaka Ratnayake pledges to reduce fuel prices

United Lanka Podujana Party Presidential candidate Janaka Ratnayake yesterday announced plans to reduce fuel prices if elected.

Speaking at a campaign event in Homagama, he emphasised that the increase in fuel prices as a significant factor contributing to the rising cost of vegetables and other essential goods.

“Two years ago, I said at the CoPF that the price of a litre of fuel could be reduced by Rs. 200, but within the last six to seven months, the price of fuel has been reduced by only

In his vision for a more efficient Government, Ratnayake proposed the use of trains for transporting goods, which he believes would be more cost-effective.

He highlighted his commitment to stabilising the prices of 20 essential items and offering economic concessions to alleviate the financial burdens faced by many citizens.

“I am the one who has presented the plans that can be practically implemented to the public. Accordingly, I said that the price of 20 items will be stabilised, and the public will be given concessions,”Ratnayake stated.

Addressing rising costs and economic challenges, Ratnayake stressed the high profit margins in the dried fruit market, alleging that merchants make a profit of up to Rs. 800 per kilo.

He also announced plans to reduce the price of alcohol by 25%.

Ratnayake emphasised that his administration aims to lower the cost of goods for the public, including alcohol, which he claims will help curb the consumption of harmful illegal liquor.

He argued that the rising prices of alcohol have led to an increase in the use of illicit brews, posing serious health risks to the population.

“Due to the increase in the price of alcohol, the use of illegal alcohol has increased, and it is harmful to the health of the people,” he added.

He noted that revenue from alcohol has already decreased by 40%, amounting to Rs. 70 billion, adding the importance of making all goods and services affordable.

Ratnayake defended his controversial stance on lowering alcohol prices, arguing that higher prices do not deter alcohol consumption but rather push people toward regular and potentially harmful drinking habits. He clarified that his goal is not to encourage alcohol consumption but to make it available at a fair price for those who choose to drink.

“Under my Government, the price of alcohol will be reduced, but that does not mean that you should drink alcohol. What I do is to provide alcohol at a fair price to the drinkers,” he said.

Ratnayake assured voters that his policies are designed to be both practical and beneficial to the public.
