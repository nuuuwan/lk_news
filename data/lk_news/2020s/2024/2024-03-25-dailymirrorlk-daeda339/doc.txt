Pay only Rs. 80 for a cup of tea from today: Asela Sampath

Colombo, March 25 (Daily Mirror) - National Consumer Front Chairman Asela Sampath urges people to limit their expenditure on a cup of tea to Rs. 80 starting today.

Addressing the media, he said even though the imported milk powder prices have been slashed, that benefit will not be given to the people by the restaurant owners.

Therefore, he requested the people not to pay more than Rs. 80 for a cup of milk tea from today. He also requested the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) to announce the maximum price for a cup of milk tea as Rs. 80 from today.

Addressing the media, he also requested the restaurant owners take immediate action to provide a cup of milk tea for Rs. 80 to increase their customer base. Sampath requested the owners to prominently display the price.

He questioned the relevant authorities for not taking action to slash the price of locally manufactured milk powder too.

The prices of imported milk powder has been slashed by Rs. 150, and currently the prices of local and imported milk powder packets are at the same price level.

He claimed that there is a tax on imported milk powder and no tax on local milk powder production. If the government can slash the imported milk powder prices, they can also slash the local milk powder prices, as it is not on the VAT list.

With the depreciation of the dollar, the government should take action to reduce sugar prices, Sampath said and also requested the CAA to announce a maximum retail price.
