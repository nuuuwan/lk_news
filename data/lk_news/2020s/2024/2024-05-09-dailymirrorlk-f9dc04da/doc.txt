No legal barrier for non Sri Lankans to register political parties; Mahinda Deshapriya

Colombo, May9 (Daily Mirror) - There is no legal barrier for the non-citizens to register a political party, Former Chairman of Elections Commission Mahinda Deshapriya said yesterday.

“Sri Lankan law only prevents a non-citizen from becoming a Member of Parliament, to contest an election while the law also prohibits a non-citizen to vote in an election,” Deshapriya told Daily Mirror.

Also, he said Former State Minister Diana Gamage has not signed nomination papers of SJB and that she has never been the general secretary of Ape Jathika Peramuna.

“Ape Jathika Peramuna was formed by late MPs Mangala Samaraweera and late Sripathi Sooriarachchi when they broke off the political alliance with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The general secretary of Ape Jathika Peramuna was Ruwan Ferdinandas while Diana Gamage’s husband took over the post later.
