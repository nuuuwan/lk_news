Speaking to the media in Kandy, Sirisena had claimed that he is ready to disclose the relevant information and that at the same time, it is the responsibility of the judges to keep the information strictly confidential.

The comments sparked controversy in the political arena with some accusing the former President of allegedly willfully concealing crucial information about the heinous bombings that claimed the lives of more than 250 people.

Amidst the controversy, however former President Sirisena had later claimed that his statement was based on certain information he had received three weeks ago.

However, addressing the media concerning the matter, IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon yesterday stated that the procedure does not entail the immediate arrest of individuals willing to provide information regarding the perpetrators of the Easter Sunday bomb attacks and instead the focus should be on investigating the information provided to apprehend the suspects.

However, he emphasized that since a trial is already underway regarding the Easter Sunday bomb attacks in the courts, the police will inform the Attorney General and the courts once a statement is recorded from the former President, in order to proceed with further legal action.

Former President Maithripala Sirisena had informed the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) yesterday that he will appear before the CID within today (March 25) to make a statement over his comments.
