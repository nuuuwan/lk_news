MP Dr. Rizvie Salih defends AKD’s selection of Ministers

National People’s Power (NPP) Colombo district MP Dr. Rizvie Salih yesterday said the new Government is of the view that the primary conditions for leading a Ministry should be a person’s qualifications, skills, and political acumen, and not their gender, race, or religion.

Responding to criticism over no Muslim representatives in the newly appointed Cabinet, Dr. Salih said he has full confidence that President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has appointed the right individuals to the right Ministries.

“As someone with far more insight into their capabilities and contributions than the rest of us, his decisions are undoubtedly rooted in merit,” he noted via a post on Facebook.

Dr. Salih pointed out that the calls to appoint a Minister based solely on religion risk fuelling unnecessary divisions and undermining the very unity the country needs to move forward.

“We elected the NPP because we trust their vision and commitment to building a better Sri Lanka for everyone, regardless of religious or ethnic differences. Let us honour that trust by giving this Government the space to deliver results without being distracted by divisive debates over who we think should hold specific Ministries. What matters is the progress of the country, not the labels of individuals,” he added.
