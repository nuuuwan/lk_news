Sri Lanka’s central bank calls for depositors to get unique identification numbers

“It is advised that all individuals and entities obtain the required identification or registration documents from the relevant authorities and update their unique identification number information with the applicable Licensed Banks and Finance Companies,” the notice said.

The time period granted by the central bank for licensed banks and licensed finance companies to mandatorily record the unique identification numbers of their existing depositors in terms of operating instructions issued under the Banking (Special Provisions) Act, No. 17 of 2023, will expire on December 31 this year.
