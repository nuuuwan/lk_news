EXPLAINER: Possible policy implications on Sri Lanka’s energy sector after parliament polls

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s energy sector is expected to undergo significant changes, guided by social and economic reforms under the island nation’s new President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and his Marxist-leaning National People’s Power (NPP) government. Here are five potential implications to the sector after the November 14 parliamentary elections:

The NPP’s policy platform strongly emphasizes environmental sustainability and energy independence. The government is expected to push for investments in renewable energy, such as solar, wind, and bioenergy projects, to reduce dependency on fossil fuel imports, as per the NPP’s policy document released before the presidential elections. This could lead to incentives for renewable projects, but it may also challenge existing energy providers reliant on non-renewable sources. ​

The government has said it will not privatize ant state-owned energy assets while allowing the private sector to help perform at its best. However, analysts say, the state control over energy utilities is likely to tighten further under a future NPP government, which could seek to restructure them to address inefficiencies, reduce corruption, and improve accessibility. While this could help stabilize prices and promote equitable access, it may lead to bureaucratic challenges or tension with private energy operators​.

The NPP may alter existing subsidy structures to ensure affordable access to energy for all citizens, especially vulnerable populations. This could inevitably involve price controls on electricity or fuel, affecting the profitability of energy companies while benefiting consumers in the short term. Any subsidy cuts to manage fiscal deficits may, however, be politically sensitive. ​

The government’s desire to reduce reliance on imported fuels aligns with the push for local renewable energy-led power production. This could lead to greater investments in local energy resources like hydropower and small-scale community wind and solar power energy projects, but it may also challenge existing deals with international energy suppliers or investors​.

5. Potential Challenges in Foreign Investment: Due to the NPP’s ideological leanings, foreign investments in large-scale energy projects could be scrutinized, especially if they involve strategic assets. This will include India’s Adani renewable energy deal in Northern Sri Lanka. While Dissanayake has moderated his rhetoric to encourage some international cooperation, concerns about foreign influence and control over national energy resources may shape new investment policies in the power and energy sector.
