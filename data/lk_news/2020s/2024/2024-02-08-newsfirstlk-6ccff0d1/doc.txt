Adjournment debate on policy statement today (08)

COLOMBO (New 1st); The Parliament adjournment debate on the policy statement presented by the President following the ceremonial opening of the fifth session of the Ninth Parliament commences on Thursday (08).

Parliament proceedings are scheduled to commence at 9.30am on Thursday (08).

The special feature of an adjournment proposal is that a vote will not be held.

In the past, after the government's policy statement or throne speech was delivered, a poll was held at the end of the debate, but after 1978, no debate was held.

On Wednesday (07), in a speech marking the opening of the fifth session of the Ninth Parliament, President Ranil Wickremesinghe extended a renewed invitation to all political parties to unite in rebuilding the nation, facing numerous economic and social challenges.

The President expressed openness to alternative approaches, noting that if there are better methods than the current policies, he is ready to consider them in depth.

However, when the President commenced his speech, a group of MPs including Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa exited the House.

Accordingly, the President's policy statement will be debated in Parliament on Thursday (08).
