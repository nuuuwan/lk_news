No footboard riding allowed, no liability for accidents: Railways Department

Colombo, April 25 (Daily Mirror) - In light of the numerous complaints received, the Railways department has stated that riding on the footboards of express trains is strictly prohibited. They have made it clear that they will not assume responsibility for any accidents involving both locals and foreign tourists.

A senior official from the department noted that several incidents have been reported where both locals and foreign tourists were observed riding on footboards, particularly on upcountry trains.

To address this issue, railway guards and other officials onboard trains have been instructed to take measures to prevent individuals from riding on footboards.

Despite these efforts, commuters traveling on the upcountry mainline have voiced their concerns regarding accidents involving foreign tourists riding on footboards of express trains.

"Even thought the railway officials informed the matter, it is very hard to convince tourists to refrain from travelling on footboards. Most of them used to complain back to the railways department that they had been harassed by the officers and they used to publish bad comments on social media about the services provided by the railways department," the official said.

It's worth noting that there are currently no rules or conditions in place regarding traveling on footboards. However, the department has made it clear that they will not accept responsibility in the event of accidents.

In the most recent incident, a foreign woman fell from the Podi Menike Express on Sunday (21) near the Ohiya railway station. Similarly, about a month ago, an Iranian tourist sustained serious injuries in a similar incident.

Passengers have highlighted the importance of railway guards and security officials taking proactive measures to prevent tourists from undertaking such risky journeys.
