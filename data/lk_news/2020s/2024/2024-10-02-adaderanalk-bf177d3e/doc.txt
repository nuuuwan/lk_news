MPs who supported former President to contest under ‘elephant’ symbol?

The former MPs who supported former President Ranil Wickremesinghe are preparing to contest the upcoming General Election under either the ‘elephant’ symbol or another common symbol, political sources told Ada Derana.

It is reported that the opinion of the Election Commission has been sought to obtain the ‘Gas Cylinder’ symbol while a final decision is to be taken after the commission’s decision is conveyed.

The group of former MPs had gathered at the Election Operations office of the former president at Flower Road in Colombo today (02), in order to reach the final decision regarding the symbol and the alliance they will contest under in the upcoming election.

It is further reported that if the former MPs are unable to obtain the ‘Gas Cylinder’ symbol, they will most likely contest under the symbol of the ‘Elephant’ or another common symbol.
