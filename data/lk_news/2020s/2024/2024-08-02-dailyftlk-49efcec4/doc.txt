The Industry Ministry has set ambitious targets to elevate the manufacturing sector’s contribution to the national GDP from 16% to 20% by the year 2030. This strategic initiative is part of a comprehensive plan outlined in the National Industry Policy and a five-year strategic roadmap spanning 2023-2027.

Industry Ministry Secretary Shantha Weerasinghe detailed these goals during a press briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Wednesday.

He highlighted the crucial role of entrepreneurship, aiming to increase its share in the workforce from 2.8% to 7%.

Weerasinghe underscored the Ministry’s proactive role in steering economic revival, particularly through navigating past economic challenges.

Key legislative efforts complement this strategic thrust, including the final Bill to amend the Industrial Promotion Act, currently under review by the Attorney General’s Department. This amendment is designed to address current and future industrial needs effectively.

The Ministry has introduced a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlining guidelines and regulatory procedures, notably introducing the “Local Value Addition Theory” for local vehicle assembly.

A significant stride towards enhancing industrial infrastructure includes the introduction of an online registration system for manufacturing industries, resulting in the registration of 3,925 industries by June 2024.
