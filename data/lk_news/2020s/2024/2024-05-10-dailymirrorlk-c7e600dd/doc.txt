A move to preempt hush-hush project on snap general election before

Colombo, May 10 (Daily Mirror) - Speculation is rife in political circles that the Election Commission announced the plan for the conduct of the presidential election interpreting the Constitution in a bid to suppress any internal political discourse for a possible snap general election, Daily Mirror learns.

There are talks that President Ranil Wickremesinghe might consider a general election ahead of the presidential election in case the government fails to secure the next tranche of the IMF Extended Fund Facility.

However, the Election Commission announced the legal provisions for the conduct of the Presidential election including the timeframe for taking polling to preempt any hush-hush project for a general election.

In the event of a general election to be concluded before the commencement of the Presidential election process by the end of July or early August, the Commission believes it will be exhausted though it is legally bound not to turn down any presidential proclamation for it.
