Meanwhile, the final decision of the PUCSL on the proposed electricity tariff revisions will be announced on 17 January 2025.

On December 06, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) submitted its electricity tariff revision proposal to the PUCSL, stating that the existing tariffs will continue further for the next six months.

Previously, it was proposed under the former government that electricity tariffs be revised four times annually. However, in 2023, tariff revisions were carried out three times, while two revisions were made this year. The current government has limited tariff revisions to twice a year.

The relevant proposal was expected to revise electricity tariffs for the first half of 2025, with implementation anticipated from the third week of January next year.
