Sri Lanka cannot depend on other nations forever: Ruwan

Sri Lanka cannot depend on other countries every day and it is high time the nation stands up on its own with pride, UNP Deputy Leader Ruwan Wijewardene said over the weekend.

“Sri Lanka cannot borrow from other nations everyday and follow their instructions. It is hightime the nation stood up by itself. President Wickremesinghe and the government is striving to see that Sri Lanka achieves this status,” Wijewardene told the UNP Gampaha District convention.

The time has come for the people of Sri Lanka to make the right decision on behalf of their nation,” he said.

“This is an election year.we may have to face a presidential election in October, it will be followed by the general election while provincial council elections will also beheld.

It is the people who should decide a course for the nation. People should make the right decision.the country has been put on the right track. President Wickremesinghe has stabilized the nation. Imagine what concessions the people of this country could enjoy if he rules this country for five more years” he added.

He said the UNP is ready to work with any party be it SJB, NPP and TNA.“President called all parties to come together for the sake of the nation. He did not make this call for his benefit,” he added.

UNP General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara said people should not be deceived by false propaganda carried out by the Opposition.”the SJB Leader is acting in a childish manner. He has displayed this by declining the President’s invitation to join hands with him for the sake of the nation,” he said.
