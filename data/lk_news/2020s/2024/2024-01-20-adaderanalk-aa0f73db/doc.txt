The second multiday fishing trawler, with 6 people aboard, was impounded shortly after.

Seized fishing trawlers, 11 suspects and the cache of narcotics were brought ashore to the Galle Harbour on Saturday morning (Jan.20) and were handed over to the custody of the PNB for onward legal action.

The suspects, aged between 28 and 52 years, have been identified as residents of Matara, Gandara, and Dondra areas.
