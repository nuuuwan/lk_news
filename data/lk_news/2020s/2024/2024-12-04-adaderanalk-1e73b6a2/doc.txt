Millers agree to supply rice at controlled price to market

Rice millers have agreed to supply 200,000 kilograms of rice daily to the market through the ‘Lanka Sathosa’, at a controlled price effective from today (04),

This was confirmed by Minister of Trade Wasantha Samarasinghe during today’s (04) parliamentary session.

Samarasinghe said that accordingly, the consumers will be able to buy rice at a price of Rs. 220 per kilogram.

“During the recent discussion with the rice mill owners, they claimed that the rice stocks in the mills cannot be released to the market due to an issue with the banks. So, yesterday, we provided them with a solution for that issue”, he added.

Meanwhile, the Trade Minister also assured that one million coconuts will be sold through Sathosa outlets in the suburbs at a price of Rs. 130 per coconut, over the next two weeks.

He added that coconut products obtained from government-owned plantations will be sold at low prices in this manner.
