MPs can be suspended for three months if found guilty of any offence

Parliament, Jan 09 (Daily Mirror) - The Attorney General has informed Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena that Members of Parliament can be suspended for a maximum of three months if they are found guilty of any offence.

Speaker Abeywardena announced that the Attorney General had come up with this conclusion after he had sought his advice on penalizing MPs for wrongdoings.

“The Attorney General has come up with this conclusion after considering Sections 66 and 67 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act No. 21 of 1953, Section 16 (1) of the Criminal Procedure and Standing Orders 77(1), 77(2) and 77(3). As per the conclusion by the Attorney General any MP could be suspended for a period ranging from one to three months if found guilty of any offence,” the Speaker announced.

Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella who responded said the Attorney General has no right to advise the Speaker.
