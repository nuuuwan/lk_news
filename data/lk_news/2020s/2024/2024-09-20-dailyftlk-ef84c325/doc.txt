Embassy in Stockholm promotes greater SL, Sweden business ties

The Embassy of Sri Lanka in Stockholm hosted the members of the Sweden Sri Lanka Business Council for an evening reception at the Embassy recently.

This elegant gathering was set to provide a unique platform for the members of the Business Council to explore opportunities for synergy, exchange ideas, and build more partnerships between Sri Lanka and Sweden.

In his remarks, Ambassador of Sri Lanka to Sweden Kapila Fonseka extended his appreciation to the Business Council Secretary General Leif Ohlson and its members for their contribution to deepen Sri Lanka â€“ Sweden business ties and invited them to explore new avenues and opportunities that will benefit not only the industries but also the two economies at large. He expressed his confidence that the mutual respect and shared goals between the two countries would provide a strong foundation to foster further collaboration. The Ambassador underscored his deep commitment to supporting the business community by facilitating investment opportunities, business partnerships, networking and collaborative ventures with Sri Lanka.

The event featured a selection of fine Ceylon teas, light refreshments, and a relaxed atmosphere for attendees to engage in one-on-one conversations, foster new relationships, and revisit existing partnerships. This event marked the first of the series of events to be organised by the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Stockholm this year to mark seventy five years of diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and Sweden.
