Sri Lanka minister tells CEB to recover Rs12bn loans given to employees

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera has instructed Ceylon Electricity Board management to implement a mechanism to recover the loan and interest amounts from employees who have taken the loans.

“Data provided by the CEB finance division shows that financial facilities extended to CEB employees amounts to about Rs 12 billion and that 2/3rds of the employees’ loan interest component is paid by the CEB,” Wijesekera said on X.

“The interest paid by the CEB on behalf of its employees is recovered from the consumer tariffs.”

Wijesekera said he had directed the CEB management to implement a mechanism to recover the loan and interest amounts from the beneficiaries of the loans “and not to pass it to the electricity consumers”.

The minister said he instructed them to report on any services that can be outsourced in the future to be more efficient and reduce cost.

Last week electrical workers protesting against the CEB restructure were interdicted.

The electricity board said that 15 cash clerks were suspended for obstructing the payment of electricity bills by closing the cash windows after trade unions launched a strike against privatization.

Wijesekera had instructed CEB management to take appropriate disciplinary action against any employee who obstructs the services or acts in violation of the guidelines issued by the CEB. (Colombo/Jan20/2024)
