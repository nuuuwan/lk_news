Knuckles Water partners with Sri Lanka Red Cross Society to provide relief

Knuckles Water, in collaboration with the Countryâ€™s Largest Humanitarian Organization, the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society (SLRCS), has taken decisive action to support communities affected by recent flooding across Sri Lanka.

Marking the first step in a broader effort to ensure immediate access to clean drinking water for flood-affected families, Knuckles Water, bottled by Cargills Food & Beverages Ltd, has donated 5-liter Knuckles Water bottles to SLRCS Gampaha to aid the relief efforts. Over 1,000 families benefited from the distribution program which focused on the Bollagala and Gagabadapara GS divisions, with around 600 families from each area receiving aid.
