Anticipated Sri Lanka tourism app set to revitalize the island’s tourism sector - report

As the first quarter of 2024 beckons, Sri Lanka’s tourism sector is brimming with anticipation. The long-awaited launch of an all-inclusive Sri Lanka Tourism app is in its final stages, promising to significantly uplift the island nation’s tourism industry. The initiative, which earned Cabinet approval back in 2019, is finally gaining momentum after being stalled by COVID-19 and other unforeseen challenges.

Priyantha Fernando, the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, has confirmed the reactivation of the initiative. To finalize the app’s scope and content, management and technical evaluation committees are being formed. The development will be undertaken by the same Malaysian developer who was initially involved. The app’s launch, however, hinges on the progress of technical requirements and necessary clearances. If the development starts from scratch, the release could extend into the second quarter of 2024. But if all goes well, tourists could have access to this comprehensive digital tool as early as March 2024.

The Sri Lanka Tourism app aims to provide comprehensive information on tourist sites, registered establishments, and service providers. It will enable tourists to purchase tickets for attractions and rate their experiences. Additional features include visa application processing and insights into tourists’ areas of interest. This data will aid in creating targeted tourism products.

The app will support multiple languages, including English, German, French, Russian, and Chinese. This move is designed to cater to a wider audience and ensure ease of use for tourists from different linguistic backgrounds. Importantly, the app’s development will not be a financial burden to the government due to a funding arrangement made with the developer in the prior Cabinet agreement.

Apart from the app, Sri Lanka’s Tourism Promotion Bureau is also addressing obstacles to marine tourism, particularly leisure activities on yachts. They have finalized classification criteria for marine tourism and are receiving assistance from the Asian Development Bank to address remaining issues. The goal is to attract wealthy Indian yacht owners to berth their vessels in marinas throughout the country.

The government has also made plans to reduce taxes, introduce water sports, and implement plans for a boat service industry to boost growth in the domestic sector. Sri Lanka aims to attract 2.3 million tourists in 2024, focusing on tourists from India, Russia, China, the UK, and Germany.

On another front, Sri Lanka has installed an AI-automated facial recognition system at Bandaranaike International Airport. This deployment aims to identify nefarious activities such as drug trafficking and ID fraud at international border crossings. This move, although controversial, is part of a crackdown by police and the Ministry of Public Security that saw over 25,000 arrests since December 17, 2023.
