Bangladesh Chief Justice agrees to quit after protesters issue one-hour ultimatum

In a fresh outbreak of stir in Bangladesh, protesters have gathered on the Supreme Court premises and have issued an ultimatum to the Chief Justice Obaidul Hassan and judges of the Appellate Division to resign by 1 pm on Saturday.

Otherwise, the protesters threatened to besiege their residences, Hasnat Abdullah, one of the coordinators of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, declared from the SC premises.

Earlier in the morning, Asif Mahmud, the adviser of Youth and Sports Ministry of the Interim government, posted on the Facebook, demanding unconditional resignation of Chief Justice Obaidul Hassan and stop the full court meeting, The Daily Star reported.

The chief justice of Bangladesh’s top court said Saturday he had agreed to resign “in principle” after an ultimatum to do so from protesters, AFP reported quoting broadcaster Jamuna TV.

Obaidul Hassan, who was appointed to helm the Supreme Court last year and is seen as a loyalist to ousted premier Sheikh Hasina, was told to step down by protesters who gathered outside the court in the capital Dhaka.
