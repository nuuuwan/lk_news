Sri Lanka’s State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe has met with Sultan Abdulrahman Al-Marshad, the Chief Executive Officer of the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD), on the sidelines of the OPEC Fund Development Forum in Vienna, Austria.

“We discussed the progress of the economy and strengthening our partnership,” he tweeted.

Semasinghe addressed the OPEC Fund Development Forum on June 25 in Vienna, Austria. The forum is attended by 125 partner countries, multilateral development banks, global development institutions and prominent private sector players to exchange insights and drive concrete action under the overarching theme of “Driving Resilience & Equity”.
