Good Life X recently concluded the intensive residency program of the Creative Catalyst Fellowship (CCF), funded through the United States Agency for International Development – supported Promoting Positive Information (PRO-INFO) project, by bringing together ten creatives from across Sri Lanka to collaborate, experiment, and develop creative content under the theme “Climate Positive.” This two-week intensive residency took place at Diyabubula, the Barberyn Art & Jungle Hideaway, the artistic abode of the late Laki Senanayake. The residency at Diyabubula, curated by Randhula de Silva, Founder of GLX, brought together experts from various fields, including science, innovation, art, design thinking, ecology, conservation and regeneration.

The inaugural cohort includes ten diverse creatives from various parts of Sri Lanka. Dilsiri Welikala from Kalpitiya raises pollution awareness with upcycled art, while Poornima Jayasinghe from Colombo specialises in public participatory art. Munira Mutaher, also from Colombo, explores human-nature relationships through photography. Mahesha Sewwandi Kariyapperuma from Kandy captures Sri Lankan identity in her work. Krishnapriya Tharmakrishnar from Jaffna focuses on human cells in her sculptures and paintings. Kanil Dias Abeygunawardene from Colombo crafts sustainable products, and Kaushalya Nandasena from Polonnaruwa documents rural life and human-elephant conflict. Lakshika Gayathree Rajapakse from Colombo creates folklore-inspired textile sculptures, Sandranathan Rubatheesan from Jaffna captures climate change impacts on agriculture, and Dinoj Mahendranathan from Batticaloa infuses natural sounds into his music productions.

“USAID is proud to harness and support Sri Lankan talent,” said Acting USAID Mission Director Maureen Hsia. “The United States recognises the importance of inspiring creativity through science and technology. The artistic content that will result from this program will better inform our citizens about the complexities of climate change and environmental protection and lead to collaborative action to pursue solutions.

“The unique environment of Diyabubula, merging art and nature, was the perfect catalyst for the fellows to develop innovative, climate-positive projects. Good Life X and CCF Program Manager Emma de Silva remarked, “Diyabubula transcends being just a location; it is a sanctuary for creative expression and deep connection to nature.”

Experts such as Maker/COO Florian Manderscheid led sessions on the design thinking process. Design Director Ismael Abedin Ingelmo discussed circularity and its processes, and Environmental Architect Sunela Jayawardene introduced bio mimicry and discussed the life and lessons from Laki Senanayake in her session. Prof. Devaka Weerakoon, a renowned environmental scientist, explored humanity and nature’s evolution and conservation success stories. Dr. Britt Yamamoto, an international leadership coach, helped redefine leadership perceptions. The fellows also engaged with the Kaludiya Pokuna Research Centre (KPRC), exploring the forest reserve and learning about conservation efforts.

CCF is dedicated to fostering collaboration, experimentation, and empowerment among Sri Lankan creatives. The fellowship aims to address pressing socio-economic and cultural issues, catalysing lasting and positive change through creative endeavours. The two-week residency at Diyabubula fostered an environment of trust, curiosity, and love for experimentation, culminating in a December 2024 exhibition where the fellows will showcase their projects.
