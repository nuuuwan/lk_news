Advocata calls for SOE reforms without delay

The  Advocata Institute held a  press briefing titled “Unlocking Economic Potential: Why Debt Restructuring Alone Won’t Suffice Without SOE Reforms” on the 17th of July,2024  at the BMICH.

The event brought together key speakers Shihar Aneez (Senior Financial Journalist), Rehana Thowfeek (Research Consultant to Advocata Institute), and Dhananath Fernando (CEO of Advocata Institute) to address the critical need for transparency and reforms in Sri Lanka’s State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs).

The speakers collectively warned that without continued SOE reforms, Sri Lanka risks perpetuating its economic challenges and will likely need to return to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) repeatedly. They urged that the government should not be involved in business operations and highlighted the potential misuse of SOEs for electoral purposes if reforms are delayed due to upcoming elections. “If SOE reforms are not continued, Sri Lanka will have to go back to the IMF over and over. Government should not be doing business, “they said.

“We are in a vicious cycle where the government has absorbed loans in order to witness profits in SOEs without addressing the need to reconstruct the current SOE-based model itself,” they said.
