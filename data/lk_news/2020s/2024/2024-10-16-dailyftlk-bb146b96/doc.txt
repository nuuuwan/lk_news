Cinnamon Life opens: Colombo’s new landmark designed by Cecil Balmond

Cinnamon Life, the latest lifestyle project by John Keells, officially opened yesterday in Colombo, designed by world-renowned architect Cecil Balmond.

The five million square foot integrated resort, designed by Balmond’s London-based studio, is set to position Colombo as a key hub on the global stage. Balmond Studio was responsible for architecture, engineering, project management and interior design of public spaces, including bespoke lighting installations.

He described the design of Cinnamon Life as inspired by abstract geometry and linked it to Sri Lanka’s ancient architectural marvels in Anuradhapura.

“The epic scale of such construction and its ground-breaking ambitions are now realised once again in a contemporary setting, uniquely, in this City of Dreams,” Balmond said.

The $ 1.2 billion project features a luxury five-star hotel, conference facilities, a 10,000 square metre casino, apartment blocks, office towers, retail space, and an exhibition centre, making it a premier destination for business, leisure, and entertainment.

Balmond, a Sri Lankan-born, OBE-awarded architect, has worked on major international projects such as the CCTV headquarters in Beijing and Qatar University.
