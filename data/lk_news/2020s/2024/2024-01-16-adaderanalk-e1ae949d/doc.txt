New QR code system for three-wheelers

Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara says measures will be taken to introduce a new QR code system within a very short period of time, in consideration of the proposal to introduce a QR code in relation to the registration and preparation of a data system for all three-wheeler drivers.

Nanayakkara expressed these views while attending the event for the establishment of the Interim Sectoral Steering Committee today (16) as the first stage of the establishment of professional councils for three-wheeler drivers.

Furthermore, the preparation of a system enabling the three-wheeler drivers to obtain hired journeys through the internet by means of the professional organization established for them, has also been taken into discussion.

This Steering Committee has been formed under the “Garu Saru” program which was commenced in order to provide professional dignity and pride to all those who are employed in the informal services sector in Sri Lanka.

This committee was formed and established under the chairmanship of the Minister of Labor and Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara.

The committee reportedly includes representatives of all three-wheeler drivers’ associations in Sri Lanka.

Meanwhile, a resolution consisting of the matters agreed upon in the previous discussions regarding the development of the dignity of their profession was also handed over to the minister during the event.
