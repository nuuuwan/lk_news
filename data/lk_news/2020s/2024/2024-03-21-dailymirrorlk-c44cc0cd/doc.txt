‘If I am fit to become MP, why can’t I function as COPE Chair?’ asks Rohitha

Parliament, March 21 (Daily Mirror)- COPE Chairman MP Rohitha Abeygunawardane asked today if he was fit to be elected as a Member of Parliament, why he cannot function as the Chairman of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE).

Abeygunawardane told Parliament that Standing Orders must include qualifications required to hold the Chairmanship of Parliamentary Committees such as COPE and COPA.

“We must include in Standing Orders the educational qualifications required to hold the Chairmanship of the COPE, COPA and other committees. Being an MP alone is not sufficient to become a Chair of a Committee. I was elected to Parliament by the people of the Kalutara District. If I am fit to be elected as an MP, why can’t I function as COPE Chair? When I was elected COPE Chair, the opposition hurled allegations against me,” he said.

The MP said he was elected the COPE Chair with a majority vote by the members of the COPE itself and that the Opposition members were resigning from COPE as the person they wanted was not elected.

He said he will carry out his duties as the COPE chair despite challenges.
