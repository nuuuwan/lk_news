Prison labour earns Sri Lanka 116 million rupees in 2023: State Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Department of Prisons has earned 116 million rupees through inmate labour, particularly that of women, in 2023, State Minister of Justice and Prison Affairs Anuradha Jayaratne has said.

“In 2023, the agriculture and industry sectors generated earnings of 116 million rupees, primarily due to the labour contributions of women. The projected profit for 2024 is estimated to be 92,572,967.00 rupees” Jayaratne told reporters last week.

The state minister said there were initiatives to empower inmates by providing them with employment.

“Through collaborative efforts between the public and private sectors, initiatives have been launched to integrate inmates into the workforce from within the prisons.”

These were implemented in the Welikada, Mahara, and Agunakolapalassa prisons, where activities like manufacturing shoes, coils, and food have been established, as a “a positive step towards rehabilitation and skills development among the incarcerated population.”

Last month, the Department and the Industrial Development Board signed a memorandum of understanding to establish industries in all prisons.

“Through this, the incarcerated person as well as the country will get a big advantage. Inmates will be able to earn some money for the government’s expenses on their behalf during their imprisonment,” Commissioner General of Prisons, Thushara Upuldeniya said at the time in a statement.

Entrepreneurs and industrialists could establish industries in the prisons, and the IDB and the Prisons Department will offer certificates to the inmates who are trained in the industries.

“The main purpose of signing this memorandum of understanding is to make the inmates a productive person for the country and society. Entrepreneurs and industrialists are invited to set up industries in the prison premises,” IDB Chairman Saranga Alahapperuma said on the IDB’s social media platform.

“This will strengthen the work currently being done by inmates. About 5,000 are already engaged in various industries,” Upuldeniya said after signing the MoU. “After they are released, they can become productive citizens by working in the industry for which they have been trained. The purpose is to make the time spent in prison meaningful.”

Developed countries, notably the US, use an incarcerated workforce as a source of cheap labour. Prisoners are usually paid the minimal or nothing at all for work they do.

Sri Lanka’s prison population is at 30,793 individuals, exceeding the capacity the system was designed for which is 12,000 inmates, Jayaratne said. The Police ‘Yukthiya’ campaign has been adding to inmate numbers.

“Inmates with drug addiction issues should receive skills training and be directed towards effective rehabilitation methods. 14,026 individuals have been referred to relevant programs in 2023. This number is anticipated to rise to 15,000 in 2024.”

22 buildings and 22 acres of land owned by the Kantale Sugar Factory have been acquired to facilitate the rehabilitation of inmates sent to prison for drug-related offenses, Jayaratne said. 6 acres of land in the Vavuniya area have been designated for the establishment of an integrated rehabilitation centre specifically for women.

Collaborations with the Ministry of Health has seen the transfer of Mantiv Island, Batticaloa, (previously used for to house those with communicable diseases) to the Prisons Department. It will be used for rehabilitation and agricultural purposes. (Colombo/Mar18/2024)
