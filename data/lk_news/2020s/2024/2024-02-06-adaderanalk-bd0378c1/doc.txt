Health trade unions temporarily postpone strike planned for tomorrow

The health sector trade unions have decided to postpone by a week the strike planned for tomorrow (Feb. 07), following discussions held with the Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.

During the discussion, a committee comprising of officials from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Health and professionals, has been appointed in order to deliberate on the proposal submitted by the trade unions.

Furthermore, the committee will take measures to deliver a stable response with regard to the issue within the next week, the Convenor of the Health Trade Union Alliance Chanaka Dharmawickrama said.

Expressing that they will closely monitor the decision of the committee, the Health Trade Union Alliance also stated that if the committee deliberately delays providing proper solutions to their issues, they will resort to the planned trade union action.
