A female non-academic staff member of a government school has been arrested for the possession of 210 grams of heroin.

The suspect was arrested by officers of the Matara Crime Division near the Bodhimaluwa Temple in the Weligama Police Division last evening (15).

The arrestee is a 43-year-old resident of the Denipitiya area.

Police stated that she is employed as a non-academic staff member of a government school in the Ayagama area and had been involved in distributing drugs for an organized crime and a drug trafficker in the Midigama area.

The investigations have revealed that the suspect had only recently started trafficking drugs and was distributing them to individuals as directed by drug traffickers hiding overseas and handling the drug networks.

The individuals who received the drugs from her were also allegedly involved in smaller-scale drug rackets.

Police stated that the suspect had been tasked with keeping a larger quantity of drugs provided to her and then distribute them among the people who are named by the drug traffickers residing abroad,

However, police said that despite the suspect being employed at a school, there is no evidence to suggest she had utilized the school with regard to these illegal activities, and that she has not directly sold any drugs to addicts.

The Matara Crimes Division (MCD) and Weligama Police are conducting further investigations into the incident.
