Assault on woman: Police clarify Governor’s remarks on son’s surrender

Colombo, March 5 (Daily Mirror) - Despite Uva Province Governor A.J.M. Muzammil's remarks that his son had informed the police of his intention to surrender over the investigations into the alleged assault of a woman, police clarified today that neither the suspect nor the Governor has directly communicated with them regarding such a surrender.

Police further said that they have not received any such communication and are conducting investigations to arrest the suspect.

According to the police, a complaint was lodged with the Wellawatta Police a few days ago accusing Mohammad Isham Jamaldeen, the son of the Uva Province Governor, of allegedly assaulting a woman at an apartment in Wellawatta. The woman who was attacked was taken to the hospital for treatment, the police said.

They said when the police went to arrest the suspect, he had left the vehicle he was travelling in and his mobile phone at a location in the Southern Province and fled to another area to evade the police.

The vehicle and the mobile phone have been taken into custody by the police.

In the wake of the investigations, the Governor said yesterday that his son had informed the police that he would appear before them on or before Tuesday.

However, police denied the remarks and said that the Wellawatta police are investigating and the suspect is still in hiding to avoid arrest.
