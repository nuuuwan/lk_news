NMRA, CID to do second factory visit on Monday with CEB Engineer

Colombo, Jan 19 (Daily Mirror) -Â  The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) will accompany NMRA and CEB officials on a second visit to the infamous factory involved in the human immunoglobulin scam on Monday with its owner, as the latter had refused to cooperate with the authorities during the first visit, the Daily Mirror learns.

Officials from the National Medicines Regulatory Authority and Ceylon Electricity Board will assist the CID investigation into the case on an order made by Maligakanda Magistrate Lochana Abeywickrema to perform a second factory visit before January 24, which the next hearing is scheduled for.

Technical assistance from an Engineer of the CEB office in Seeduwa has been requested during the factory visit to illuminate the premises, as the owner of the Isolez Biotech Pharma AG (Pvt) Ltd. Sudath Janaka Fernando had claimed he could not remember where the main switchboard is located to turn the power on, during the first factory visit on January 8, the police said.

Officials from the CID Special Investigation Unit 1 will accompany NMRA and CEB officials to the factory premises located on No.251/A, Sarana Mawatha, Baseline Road, Amandoluwa in Seeduwa as per the court order and the Prisons Department officials are expected to escort the first suspect Sudath Janaka Fernando.

The case is next scheduled for January 24 and the respective officials are to furnish the court with a report on the factory visit.
