Cornell University and University of Moratuwa students pilot innovative industry collaboration with Brandix

Students from Cornell University, New York, USA and the University of Moratuwa, recently visited Brandix and its facilities, establishing a bridge between academia and industry in the pursuit of innovative solutions. This visit was to conclude the first set of collaborative undergraduate research projects involving Brandix, Cornell University and the University of Moratuwa.

The partnership reflects a commitment to providing students with real-world experience and cultivating the next generation of leaders and changemakers in the fashion industry, both from Sri Lanka and around the world.

Denise Nicole Green, Associate Professor of the Department of Fiber Science & Apparel Design and the Director of the Cornell Fashion + Textile Collection at Cornell University said, “The best way to prepare students to become leaders and changemakers in the fashion industry is to provide real-world experience with model companies like Brandix who are leading the charge for a more sustainable and socially responsible future for the industry. That is exactly what we have achieved here today,”

Meanwhile, Eng. S.N. Niles, Head of the Department of Textile Engineering at the University of Moratuwa added, “Having our students with their textile engineering emphasis collaborate with students specialising in fibre science, fashion design and fashion management was indeed an eye opener. Thus the cross-cultural, interdisciplinary collaboration was a valuable experience for the students.”

Brandix, a trailblazer in championing sustainability and social responsibility in the apparel sector, provided an ideal platform for students to apply their academic knowledge to practical challenges. By immersing themselves in the day-to-day operations of a model company like Brandix, students gained invaluable insights into sustainable practices and ethical considerations crucial for the industry’s future. The collaboration challenged students to think creatively, urging them to address unmet needs and desires while championing environmental and social justice. The mantra of “improving lives” guided the design process, ensuring a focus on purpose, people, and the planet, fostering a generative and authentic collaboration.
