Sri Lanka’s Lankem to open fertilizer plant

ECONOMYNEXT – Lankem Ceylon Plc said it is building a fertilizer plant in Oyamaduwa in Anuradhapura at an estimated cost of 2.5 billion rupees.

“The primary objective of this operation is to cater to the agricultural requirement of the non-perennial crops,” the company said in a stock exchange filing.

A new company, Lankem Minerals Limited, a fully owned subsidiary of Lankem Ceylon, has been set up to carry out the project.

The sales and distribution of the fertilizer will be carried out by Lankem Ceylon and its fully-owned subsidiary SunAgro LifeScience Limited through the companies’ existing distributor network.

Commercial operations are expected to commence by the end of the year.

Lankem Ceylon is involved in the production, marketing, and distribution of agrochemical products including straight fertilizers, mixed fertilizers, granular fertilizers, and foliar fertilizers.

Lankem shares were trading up at 71.50 during Friday mid-day trade.

Sri Lanka imports nitrogen fertilizer including urea, ammonia, sodium fertilizer, super phosphate, potassium chloride, potassium sulphate and mixtures of fertilizer.

The country’s agriculture industry, including rice and tea, are heavily reliant on fertilizer use. (Colombo/Jun7/2024)
