Case against former President Sirisena fixed for ex parte trial

The Colombo District Court has ordered for a case against former President Maithripala Sirisena to be heard ex parte.

This order was issued when the case related to the injunction issued preventing the former President from functioning as the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was taken up this morning (24).

However, this decision was reached as former President Maithripala Sirisena did not appear for the court proceedings.

The case has been filed by Montague Sarathchandra, an executive committee member of the SLFP.

On April 04, the Colombo District Court issued an enjoining order preventing former President Maithripala Sirisena from functioning as the SLFP chairman.

However, the former President resigned from the post of Chairman of the SLFP on May 12, following which the faction of the SLFP led by Sirisena appointed Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe as the new Chairman of the party.
