Sri Lanka government repays foreign debt on a net basis in 1Q 2024

ECONOMYNEXT  – Sri Lanka’s budget foreign financing was negative in the first quarter of 2024, as the government repaid debt on a net basis, official data show.

Sri Lanka has a debt moratorium and unless new budget support loans come from agencies like the World Bank or Asian Development Bank, or some earlier projects disburse funds, the government has to keep servicing multilateral debt.

Foreign financing was a net repayment of 14.9 billion rupees in the first three months of the year, the central bank said which was lower than the negative 41.4 billion in 2024.

While interest payments will have to be serviced with the restructuring agreements of the bilaterals, new principle disbursements will take place as soon as projects are resumed.

Domestic financing was also lower at 296.1 billion rupees, down from 666.1 billion last year. (Colombo/June29/2024)
