Spells of showers expected in several provinces

The Meteorology Department says several spells of showers will occur in Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central, Southern and North-western provinces.

Showers or thundershowers may occur at a few places elsewhere of the island in the evening or night, it said.

The general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
