Sri Lanka Tourism triumphs at ITB Berlin 2024

The ITB Berlin Convention, the world’s leading travel industry think tank, recently concluded its 2024 event, where over the course of three days, top international Travel and Tourism industry thought leaders gathered to discuss the latest trends, innovations, and developments, and to debate the major challenges facing the global travel industry.

In a significant moment for Sri Lanka Tourism, the new Island destination positioning ‘You’ll Come Back for More’ was unveiled at the convention, along with the new logo and global tourism campaign.

This pivotal event took place under the auspices of the Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, with the participation of key industry leaders. The unveiling served as a platform to showcase the unique attributes of Sri Lanka at a global stage, highlighting the country’s unparalleled diversity.

Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando speaking at the event said, “Sri Lanka Tourism is launching its destination brand campaign globally with a new positioning and a tagline: ‘You’ll come back for more’. What inspired us was the simple fact that 33% of our travellers are repeat visitors. We have people from across the world returning to Sri Lanka, some as many as 100 to 150 times. When you listen to their stories and experiences in our island, you will realise that there is something special about Sri Lanka.

‘It’s not just a bucket list country. There is a deep bond Sri Lanka creates with our visitors and as a result they keep coming back for the people, the places, and moments.

‘We want to share this unique story of our Island with the world. Under the new destination positioning, we have a 360-degree approach to tell our story. But while we communicate all that we have to offer the world, we will also ensure the quality of the experiences each traveller has with us is also rich.”
