No JVP member has joined SJB: Anura Kumara refutes SJB claims

Mannar, May 25 (Daily Mirror)- The National People's Power (NPP) today refuted claims that a JVP member has joined the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) during a meeting in Polonnaruwa.

NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the particular person was not a JVP member but an SLFP member.

Speaking at a meeting in Mannar, Dissanayake said the particular person Hitihamilage Saman Kumara is an SLFP candidate who had submitted nominations for the Local Government elections to contest for the Bendiwewa Division of the Polonnaruwa Municipal Council.

"You must have seen the SJB today cheerfully claiming at an SJB rally in Polonnaruwa that a JVP member had joined the SJB. This will create big news on television today. All SJB leaders embraced him happily. I know who he is. He is Hitihamilage Saman Kumara, who submitted his nominations for the Local Government elections to contest for the Bendiwewa Division of the Polonnaruwa Municipal Council under the SLFP ticket. The SLFP member has become a JVP member for the SJB. They are anyhow trying to hoodwink the people," he said.
