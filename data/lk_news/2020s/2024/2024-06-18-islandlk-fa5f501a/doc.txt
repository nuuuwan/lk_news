King of Sing-Along

We have in our midst, or, let’s say, the world over, the King of Pop, King of Rock ‘n’ Roll, etc., and I thought of adding to that list the King of Sing-Along.

Taking into account his achievements at sing-along events, in our scene, I’ve decided to give that title to Sohan Weerasinghe.

He is, indeed, the King of Sing-Along and he has that special knack of generating the kind of excitement that invariably has the audience moving into action.

Sohan already has quite a few sing-along events lined up but the big one would undoubtedly be The Island/Sunday Island sponsored ‘Golden Memories XI’, organised by Symphony (Pvt) Ltd.

It will be held on 29th June at the BMICH Banquet Hall and will also feature Mignonne and Suraj, Sureshini, Ishini, and Nilanka.

The X-Periments will provide the music, with Kumar de Silva handling the evening’s proceedings.

Tickets are priced at Rs. 4500/=, inclusive of dinner, and can be obtained from Dushyantha (0777789226) or Mano (0772587928).

‘Golden Memories XI’ is in aid of the Paediatric Ward of the Cancer Hospital.

Remember, you have the opportunity of exercising your vocal cords at this special event…yes, a star for one night!
