SC rejects petition seeking to remove interim order on Deshbandu Tennakoon

The Supreme Court today (18) dismissed the petition of intervention filed seeking an order suspending the interim injunction issued preventing Deshabandu Tennakoon from functioning as the Inspector General of Police (IGP).

Ven. Dr. Bellanwila Dhammaratana Thero, Ven. Prof Agalakada Sirisumana Thero and Ven. Prof. Kotapitiye Rahula had filed the intervening petition.

The petition of intervention was taken up today (18) before a three-judge Supreme Court bench consisting of Justices Yasantha Kodagoda, Achala Wengappuli and Mahinda Samayawardhena.

Announcing the order, the chair of the judge bench, Justice Yasantha Kodagoda, had informed that the intervening petition would be dismissed as its content was insufficient to maintain a case.
