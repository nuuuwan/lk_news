Govt. vows to prevent resurgence of racist politics; religious extremism

The Government yesterday reaffirmed its commitment to preventing the resurgence of any divisive racist politics or religious extremism.

Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa disclosed that intelligence services have observed attempts to stir such sentiments, particularly via social media, and the Government is prepared to take all necessary actions, including introducing new legislation, to address the issue.

“No one will be allowed to use nationalist or religious rhetoric as a means to gain political power in this country again,” Dr. Jayatissa said during the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing.

Noting that the Government has expressed its intent to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), Dr. Jayatissa acknowledged that the existing law will remain in force until new legislation is introduced.

The matter of repealing the PTA has been a longstanding issue, he noted, adding that will be discussed as Parliament progresses.

Drawing on the electoral support that spanned all communities and provinces, Dr. Jayatissa asserted that the Government’s mandate reflects a collective trust that will not be undermined by divisive agendas. “The Government will not allow any room for activities that threaten national unity or stability,” he said.
