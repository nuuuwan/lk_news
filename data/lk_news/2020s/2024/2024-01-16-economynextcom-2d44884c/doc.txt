Sri Lanka opposition promises to repeal planned online speech law

ECONOMYNEXT – The Samagi Jana Balavegaya party will repeal the Online SafetyBill and introduce a new one if it comes to power, opposition MP Harsha de Silva said.

“Strongly opposed to the Govt’s move to enact the Online Safety Bill. If passed, I pledge that a future SJB-led Govt will swiftly repeal controversial bill. We won’t jeopardize ties with major platforms like Meta, Google, and YouTube, essential for #lka economic growth,” de Silva said on X.

“Committed to true Online Safety, we’ll introduce a new law addressing issues like child porn and other serious online crimes with the collaboration of major platforms. It’s crucial for the wellbeing of Sri Lanka society. Let’s prioritize effective solutions over hasty decisions.”

Sri Lanka’s Supreme Court determined that the controversial ‘Online Safety Bill’ is not inconsistent with the constitution and can be passed in parliament by a simple majority subject to amendments made to 31 of its provisions. (Colombo/Jan16/2024)
