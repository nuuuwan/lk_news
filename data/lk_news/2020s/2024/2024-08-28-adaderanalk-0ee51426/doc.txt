Petition challenging President Ranil’s eligibility to contest prez poll dismissed with costs

The Supreme Court has dismissed a petition challenging President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s eligibility to run in the presidential election, which was based on claims of failure to appoint the Acting IGP and judges to the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal.

Meanwhile, the court has also ordered the petitioner to pay Rs. 50,000 as legal costs.

Additional Solicitor General Nerin Pulle, who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General, argued that the petition contained false information and that it has breached the Article 92 of the Constitution.

The relevant petition had been filed by a lawyer requesting the court to issue an order to the incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe to appoint an Acting IGP. However, the petitioner had also sought a ruling that Wickremesinghe, who was named a respondent of the case, is not qualified to contest the presidential election.
