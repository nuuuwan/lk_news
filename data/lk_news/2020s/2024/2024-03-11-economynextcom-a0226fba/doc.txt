Sri Lanka SEC urges fund management firm to get into ETF and umbrella scheme

ECONOMYEXT – Sri Lanka’s Securities and Exchange Commission has urged the country’s unit trusts to be more active for fund managers to make use of regulation that allow Exchange Traded Funds and Umbrella schemes.

The SEC has not received applications from managing companies for the establishment of such schemes.

SEC Chairman Faizal Salieh had urged the industry representatives to identify the interests of different investor categories and design new products, at a recent meeting with CEOs of the Unit Trust industry, a statement said.

Salieh suggested that “the Unit Trust industry introduces capital protected investment schemes where the Managing Company would be able to provide a return to their clients whilst preserving the capital.”

The SEC, under the Collective Investments Code 2022 (CIS Code) has introduced the regulatory framework for the operation of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and Umbrella Schemes.

However, the SEC is yet to receive applications from Managing Companies for the establishment of such schemes.

Salieh urged industry representatives “to identify interests of different investor categories, target segments and design new and relevant products that would enhance the overall attractiveness of the Unit Trust industry to the investor public.” (Colombo/Mar11/2024)
