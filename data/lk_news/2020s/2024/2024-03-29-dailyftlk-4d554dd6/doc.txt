Parliamentary delegation participates in 72nd Westminster Conference

A three-member delegation from Sri Lanka’s Parliament attended the 72nd Westminster Conference, which took place from 11 to 15 March at the British Parliament in London.

Deputy Speaker of House Ajith Rajapaksa, MP Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, Parliament Deputy Secretary General and Chief of Staff Chaminda Kularatna represented Sri Lanka’s Parliament.

Representatives from about 28 Commonwealth member States, including MPs and Parliamentary Secretaries attended this year’s conference. Parliamentary traditions of Commonwealth countries, MPs’ rights and powers, the committee system, means of adopting constitutional orders and their traditions, current social media and technology, and how research techniques applied in MPs’ roles were all explored.

The Sri Lankan delegation had the opportunity to participate in the 75th celebration of the Commonwealth held at the British Parliament this year, which marks the 75th anniversary of the establishment of the Commonwealth of Nations, and the service held at Westminster Abbey in London.

Members of the royal family, including Queen Camilla, Crown Prince William, Prince Edward and Princess Anne, attended the Westminster Abbey service on His Majesty Charles III’s behalf.
