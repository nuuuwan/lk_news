Showers expected in certain parts of the country

Showers or thundershowers may occur at a few places in Kalutara, Galle, Matara and Rathnapura districts in the evening or night.

Mainly fair weather will prevail elsewhere, according to the Meteorology Department.

Fairly strong winds about 30 kmph can be expected at times in eastern slopes of the central hills and in North-central, North-western, Uva, Southern and Eastern provinces and in Matale and Kandy districts.

Misty conditions can be expected at some places in Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces during the morning, it said.

The public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
