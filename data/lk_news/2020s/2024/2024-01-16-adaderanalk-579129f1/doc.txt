Self-proclaimed ‘Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva’ remanded

Mahinda Kodituwakku, the self-proclaimed ‘Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva’, has been remanded until 24 January, on orders of the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court.

Kodituwakku was arrested on 15 January, on charges of committing irreligious activities that are contrary to Buddhist teachings.

On 12 January, the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court also imposed an overseas travel ban on him.

Earlier this month, the president of Buddhist Information Centre, Ven. Agulugalle Sri Jinananda Thero had filed a complaint with the CID alleging that Kodituwakku has been misleading the Buddhist community.

Alleging that Kodituwakku has been misleading the Buddhist community, Jinananda Thero claimed that he was directly involved with the recently deceased preacher named Ruwan Prasanna Gunaratna, who had promoted ‘mass suicide’ through his distorted teachings and later died by suicide.

Meanwhile, Ven. Balangoda Kassapa Thero, addressing a media briefing, claimed that this self-proclaimed ‘Bodhisattva’ had sexually abused his own daughter before leaving his house while calling it ‘Abinishkramanaya’ (Great Departure).

Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings on the path to becoming Buddhas but postpone reaching nirvana to help humanity.
