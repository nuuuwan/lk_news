Harsha non-committal on Ranilâ€™s claim

Colombo, March 13 (Daily Mirror) - Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Harsha de Silva was non-committal on the recent remark by President Ranil Wickremesinghe that the SJB leadership has sidelined party men like him and is depending on others such as MPs Professor G.L. Peiris and Nalaka Godahewa.

"You should ask President Wickremesinghe about our being sidelined. We cannot comment on that," Dr. De Silva said in response to a question raised by the media as to whether MPs such as him are sidelined by the SJB leadership.

Also he said Sri Lanka should be a stakeholder of fast developing Indian states such as Tamil Nadu, Andra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala if it is to survive in the future. These states are identified as the fastest developing regions. Sri Lanka should become a stakeholder of this development and should try to benefit from it, he added.
