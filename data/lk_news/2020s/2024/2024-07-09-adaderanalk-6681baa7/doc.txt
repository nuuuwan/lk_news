Two arrested with ‘Ice’ worth nearly Rs. 10 million

The Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) has arrested two individuals in possession of 1 kg and 14 grams of crystal methamphetamine (commonly known as ‘Ice’), with an estimated street value of Rs. 10 million.

The suspects were found with the drugs and Rs. 1 million in cash, suspected to be proceeds from drug trafficking.

Acting on information that the suspects were seeking a buyer for the ‘Ice’, the police have posed as buyers and apprehended them.

During interrogation, it has been revealed that the drug consignment belonged to a large-scale drug trafficker who is currently hiding abroad.

The arrested individuals are residents of the ‘Mihijaya Sevana’ housing scheme in the Jinthupitiya area of Grandpass, the police said.

The suspects will be further questioned under detention orders as the Police Narcotics Bureau continues its investigation into the incident, according to police.
