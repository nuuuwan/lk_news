Immigration officials stage symbolic protest

Colombo, April 12 (Daily Mirror) - The Sri Lanka Immigration & Emigration Officersâ€™ Association (SLIEOA) has launched a 24-hour symbolic strike against steps taken to change the service system by cancelling the more efficient service system without any reasons and causing serious hardships to the serving officers.

SLIEOA Secretary K.P. Manawadu pointed out that their officers have been under unnecessary pressure due to the decisions taken by the departmental authorities in some cases.

Accordingly, the symbolic strike was launched at 9 a.m. and will continue till 9 a.m. tomorrow.

"We decided to embark on a professional action to cover all the airports and seaports of the country by requesting all officers to wear black belts and distribute leaflets," Manawadu said.

The SLIEOA secretary also told the media that the professional action that was launched will ensure that there will be no blockage or inconveniences caused to passengers travelling from any airport or port in the country, and that they will engage in the professional action like real professionals so that the reputation of the country will not be tarnished.
