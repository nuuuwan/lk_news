Kamal Addararachchi announces candidacy in General Election

Veteran Sri Lankan actor Kamal Addararachchi has announced his decision to contest in the upcoming General Election.

He is expected to contest the election representing the ‘Devana Parapura’ party (Second Generation) led by Uvindu Wijeweera, the son of former leader of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Rohana Wijeweera.

Addressing a press briefing held today (09), Addararachchi said: “It is the responsibility of the people to form a good Parliament. Let’s break the culture of bringing unsuccessful people to the Parliament again and again. Let’s select a new team that can work cooperatively and intelligently.”

“That strength can be given through the ‘Devana Parapura’. I also joined ‘Devana Parapura’ today to strengthen them.”

Commenting at the press briefing, leader of the party Uvindu Wijeweera said: “The country cannot be developed if you send the same old thieves to the opposition. Let’s fill the entire Parliament with people who love this country.”
