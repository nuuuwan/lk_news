Sri Lanka CB chief sees strong, more than expected 4-pct growth in 2024

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s 2024 economic growth will be stronger than the expected 4 percent due to increased economic activities, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.

The Central Bank had originally projected 3 percent growth for this year against the International Monetary Fund’s expected expansion of 1.2 percent. The World Bank has projected Sri Lanka’s growth at 2,2 percent for this year, while the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has estimated at 2.6 percent.

“We see more than expected growth in the second quarter,” Weerasinghe told reporters in Colombo at a media briefing on Friday (27) after maintaining the key policy rates steady.

“Originally we projected 3 percent growth and last time we said the growth could be around 4 percent. But as per now, the annual growth could be more than that.”

Sri Lanka’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew 4.7 percent in the second quarter of 2024 after the first quarter’s 5.3 percent expansion, helped by low inflation and strong exchange rates, the state-run statistics office said.

“If we look at the first half growth, we can see the trend. In the growth, after two years of contraction, there is a clear recovery path,” Weerasinghe said.

“If you look at the early indicators and current economic activities with some of the forward looking indicators, we now see strong evidence that the economy will grow well over 3 percent. But it is too early to project a specific number.” (Colombo/September 27/2024)
