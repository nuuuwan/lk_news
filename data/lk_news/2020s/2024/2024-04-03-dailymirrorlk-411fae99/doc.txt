56% accidents on expressways caused by driver negligence: Minister

Colombo, April 3 (Daily Mirror) -The report from the committee assigned to investigate into State Minister Sanath Nishantha's recent accident on the Katunayake Expressway shows that 56 per cent of accidents on the expressway are caused by driver negligence.

During his speech at an event organized for the official launch of the School Road Safety Club at the Ministry, Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardana remarked that since the implementation of the expressway system in the country, a rapid transportation network has been established. However, the unfortunate reality is that a significant number of fatalities are reported every year as a consequence.

Following the recent accident of State Minister Sanath Nishantha on the Katunayake Expressway, several committees have been appointed by the Transport Ministry to investigate into the incident.

According to the report, many facts were mentioned under the category of 'driver negligence', such as driving vehicles under the influence of alcohol, driving at high speed, not maintaining the required distance between two vehicles, attempting to overtake other vehicles, and engaging in telephone conversations while driving.

Nine per cent of accidents are caused by defects in the vehicle. Most of the defects in the vehicle are caused by certain issues with the tyres, such as bursts and using inappropriate tyres to drive on expressways.

According to the report, 33 per cent of accidents are caused by other reasons, such as changing weather patterns, heavy rains, and skidding.

According to this report, some remedies to be taken should be discussed with the police and the relevant departments before this year's festive season, and the measures that are suitable for the short term and long term are to be followed.
