Observation coaches cause 80% of derailments in upcountry

Colombo, Jan 31 (Daily Mirror) - Due to possible derailments of 55-seater train observation coaches, the Railways Department has advised removing 2 out of 4 compartments from operation in the upcountry with immediate effect, Railways General Manager H.M.K.W. Bandara said.

He told the Daily Mirror that the decision was taken due to the sharpness of the bends on upcountry railway lines.

The GMR said that 80% of the train derailments on the upcountry railway lines were observation coaches.

Therefore, he recommended assigning 45-seater train observation coaches to operate on upcountry railway lines.

Two 55-seater train observation coaches have already been modified, and another two are still under modification.

He also said that instructions have been given to modify the 55-seater train observation coaches to 45-seater train observation coaches immediately. Accordingly, the new compartments will come into operation by next week.
