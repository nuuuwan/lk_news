Bread prices in Kalutara district increase against raids

Following the decision to initiate raids targeting the sale of underweight bread in bakeries, bakery owners in the Kalutara district have decided to increase the selling price of a loaf of bread.

The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) initiated raids targeting the sale of underweight bread in bakeries starting yesterday.

Accordingly, the selling price of a loaf of bread, which was Rs. 130, has increased to Rs. 150. Even though the government announced the weight of a loaf of bread at 450g, most of the shops sell bread weighing nearly 350g.
