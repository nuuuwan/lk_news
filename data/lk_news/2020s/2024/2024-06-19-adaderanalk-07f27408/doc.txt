Court refuses interim order against SLFPâ€™s ExCo meeting

The Colombo District Court has refused to grant an interim order preventing the SLFP Executive Committee chaired by the Acting Chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), Nimal Siripala de Silva from holding a meeting this afternoon (19).

Accordingly, the court decided to only issue notices to the defendants in the petition and decided that the case would be called again on July 03.

The court issued this order after considering a petition submitted by an electoral organizer of SLFP, Hector Bethmage, seeking a court order preventing the SLFP Executive Committee meeting from being held.
