Increase in cargo vessel arrivals in Colombo port due to crisis in Red Sea

Colombo, Jan 28 (Daily Mirror) - The number of cargo vessels arriving at the Colombo port has increased, further increasing the container operation capacity, Ports, Shipping and Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.

Undertaking a special inspection visit to the Container Terminal (JCT) of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, he said the container operation capacity was increasing due to the current crisis in the Red Sea in the Middle East.

Due to the war situation in the Middle East region, the shipping companies have been motivated to divert their ships to the Colombo port as a safety measure due to the terrorist threats to merchant ships sailing through the Suez Canal to the Red Sea.

Therefore, berthing facilities for 24 ships have been made in the harbour today, and around 10 ships are awaiting anchorage outside the harbour.

Based on this situation, the JCT and the Eastern Container Terminal (ECT) have been able to handle about 100 ships during January.

Apart from these container ships, five-passenger ships too have arrived at the Colombo port.

A total of 193,000 containers were handled at these two terminals in January, which is a 70% improvement. The Colombo Port as a whole handled 554,000 containers during January.

During the visit, the Minister instructed the officers to carry out these ship operations effectively and efficiently.
