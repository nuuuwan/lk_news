Asia-Pacific women more likely to be in care employment: UN report

ECONOMYNEXT – In the Asia Pacific, including Sri Lanka, women are more likely to be in care employment compared to men, a UN Women’s latest report finds.

“For some this is a choice; for others it is not,” UN Women said.

Ageing populations are likely to put pressure on fiscal systems with rising demands for costly care services, such as long-term care, the report found.

“Population projections for the Asia-Pacific region anticipate an important demographic shift with significant implications for societies and economies in the region,” the report states.

“The low fertility rates observed in several countries coupled with low mortality rates have raised questions – especially in fast-ageing societies, such as in Eastern Asia – about who will provide long-term care for older

people, a traditional role of women and girls within families.

“In other contexts, such as Southern Asia, unlocking women’s time constrains through increased availability of care services is needed to reap the potential benefits of changing demographic structures.”

Migration, including migrant care workers, will have a key role in potentially meeting increasing care demands associated with higher dependency ratios, the report said.

“In the Asia-Pacific region, women and girls deliver the greater portion of care services in an unremunerated form of household work.”

“Available time-use data for the region, while scarce, illustrates that gender gaps are acute with women at a disadvantage in all selected countries and with indirect care provision accounting for the greatest time spent providing unpaid care services.” (Colombo/Oct4/2024)
