Lohan Ratwatte and wife further remanded

The Nugegoda Magistrate’s Court yesterday ordered to further remand former State Minister Lohan Ratwatte and his wife Shashi Prabha Ratwatte till 18 November, over the case involving an unregistered luxury vehicle.

The duo was arrested and remanded over the charges of using a luxury car illegally imported and assembled in Sri Lanka.

The luxury vehicle in question was found without a number plate at a house belonging to Ratwatte’s wife in Embuldeniya area last month, during a probe conducted by a team of Police officials based on a tip-off from the Mirihana Police.

During the investigation, both Ratwatte and his wife had explained to the Police that his mother-in-law resides in the said house. They had claimed that the car had been brought there three weeks ago by Ratwatte’s private secretary, who was recently found dead with gunshot injuries in the Katugastota area of Kandy.

Former State Minister was arrested by Mirihana Police in Kandy on 31 October over the incident, and his wife was also taken into Police custody on 4 November. However, Ratwatte, who was admitted to the Prison Hospital for treatment on 2 November, was later transferred to the Colombo General Hospital, owing to a sudden illness while in custody.
