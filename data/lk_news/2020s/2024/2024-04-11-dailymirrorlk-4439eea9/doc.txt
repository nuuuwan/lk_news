Sri Lankans rescued from cyber slave camp in Myanmar transferred to Embassy

Eight Sri Lankans who were recently rescued from an illegal cyber slave camp in Myanmar, have been transferred to the care of the Sri Lankan Embassy in Thailand.

The group, victims of a human trafficking ring, is slated for repatriation to Sri Lanka in the coming days, as confirmed by Sri Lanka's Ambassador to Myanmar, Janaka Bandara.

This development follows the rescue operation conducted in March this year, where eight Sri Lankans were among a group of 56 individuals rescued with the cooperation of Myanmar authorities.

Subsequently, the group, consisting of six males and two females, was placed under the custody of the Myawaddy Police in Myanmar.

Upon their rescue, efforts spearheaded by the Sri Lankan Mission, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and other pertinent authorities have continued to facilitate the safe return of the rescued Sri Lankans.
