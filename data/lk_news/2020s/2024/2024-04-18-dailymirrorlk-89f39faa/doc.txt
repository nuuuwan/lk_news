Tough action against those inconveniencing foreign visitors: Diana Gamage

Colombo, April 18 (Daily Mirror) - Strict measures will be taken against anyone causing inconvenience to foreigners visiting the country. She expressed concern over a group of individuals engaging in such indecent behavior, labeling them as disgraceful, Tourism State Minister Diana Gamage said.

"These individuals show no respect towards foreigners. Their actions pose a threat to our country's reputation and cannot be tolerated," she stated.

The State Minister highlighted that modern-day tourists are well-informed and not easily misled. She stressed the importance of maintaining Sri Lanka's reputation for friendliness and hospitality.

"With nearly 700,000 foreigners having visited by April, it's crucial to prevent such actions from tarnishing our image and damaging our economy," Gamage warned.

Recently, there have been two reported incidents in Kalutara and the Aluth Kade area of Colombo where tourists were treated poorly and charged excessively for meals.
