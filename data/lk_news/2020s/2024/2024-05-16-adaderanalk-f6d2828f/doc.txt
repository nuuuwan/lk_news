Complaint filed with Bribery Commission against Maithripala Sirisena

A former executive member of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), Montague Sarathchandra has filed a complaint with the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption against former President Maithripala Sirisena.

In a letter to the Chairman of the Bribery Commission, Mr. Sarathchandra claims that party supporters are speculating that former President Maithripala Sirisena has paid the compensation to the victims of the Easter Sunday terror attacks, with an “advance obtained from selling the Sri Lanka Freedom Party”.

The said complaint has been filed seeking an investigation in relation to how he had obtained the relevant funds.
