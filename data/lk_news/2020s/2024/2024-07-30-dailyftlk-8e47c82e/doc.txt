The SPARK Skilled Youth Entrepreneurship competition, a premier national platform dedicated to inspiring and empowering young entrepreneurs, has officially begun accepting applications for its 2024 edition. Organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, SPARK offers a unique opportunity for youth aged 15 to 30 years to develop their entrepreneurial skills and gain valuable exposure in two categories: The School Category and the Open Category.

Ceylon Chamber of Commerce CEO, Buwenakabahu Perera, highlighted the competition’s vital role in nurturing young entrepreneurial talent in Sri Lanka. “We prioritise youth entrepreneurship development and recognise the significant contribution young entrepreneurs make to the future of Sri Lanka’s commercial sector. Our commitment to the SPARK platform, in collaboration with our private sector partners, is to cultivate young ambitions and showcase the potential of the next generation of Sri Lankan entrepreneurs. An exciting competition awaits this year’s participants, and we strongly encourage parents and educators to support youth participation.”

This year’s edition will feature enhanced online workshops designed to provide deeper insights and advanced entrepreneurial skills. The mentorship program has been broadened to include a wider range of industry experts, offering personalised guidance to participants. Winners will have greater opportunities for international networking, enhancing their exposure to global entrepreneurial ecosystems.

Celebrating its second consecutive year, SPARK 2024 builds on the success of its inaugural edition. Last year’s competition saw participants excel in creating business plans through online workshops, business pitching sessions, a boot-camp, and one-on-one mentoring. The top winners were awarded the chance to visit advanced innovation ecosystems in Hyderabad, India.

SPARK 2023 winner, Mihindi Minupama Bandara, a 16-year-old, shared her experience: “I applied to SPARK with high expectations and succeeded in achieving my goal. It paved a clear path towards my entrepreneurial future. I believe that entrepreneurs are essential for a nation’s development. The SPARK competition helped me develop the skills I need to become a successful entrepreneur.” She encourages this year’s participants by saying, “Everyone has a chance to participate in SPARK this year. Participating in the competition is a victory in itself, so don’t miss this wonderful opportunity to turn your dreams into reality.”

Mihindi’s father, Lalith Sujeewa Bandara, expressed his pride and satisfaction with his daughter’s involvement in the competition. “I wasn’t worried about her managing entrepreneurial activities alongside her school education because she balances her time well. Participating in this competition allows her to explore beyond traditional career paths. I urge parents to motivate their children to participate in SPARK, to develop vital skills and pursue their ambitions.”

Supported by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the South Asia Leadership in Entrepreneurship (SALE) project, and funded by the US Department of State, SPARK 2024 aims to promote youth entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka by fostering a conducive environment for start-up businesses and increasing interest in entrepreneurship.

ILO Chief Technical Advisor Dr. Thomas Kring, highlighted the potential and resilience of Sri Lanka’s young entrepreneurs. “We invite youth to apply to the competition and pitch their ideas and solutions for the pressing challenges of our time. Our support aims to empower young people as they venture into the entrepreneurial world. Competitors will gain invaluable skills, while winners will benefit from international exposure and extended networking opportunities for potential business partnerships.”
