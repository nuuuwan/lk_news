Lankan envoy in Malaysia meets with Small and Medium Enterprises Association

Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Malaysia Air Chief Marshal (Rtd.) Sumangala Dias held a fruitful meeting with the Small and Medium Enterprises Association of Malaysia (SAMENTA) at the High Commission recently.

This meeting marked a significant step towards strengthening collaboration and networking between Sri Lankan business entities and Malaysian entrepreneurs.

SAMENTA, a pivotal organisation established in 1986, represents and advocates for the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia. SMEs form the backbone of the Malaysian economy, accounting for 98.5% of all Malaysian enterprises. Their vital role in economic growth and development underscores the importance of fostering international partnerships.

During the meeting, SAMENTA National President Datuk William Ng expressed his Association’s enthusiasm for the increasing presence of Sri Lankan businesses in Malaysia. He affirmed SAMENTA’s commitment to assisting new Sri Lankan enterprises in enhancing their market visibility within Malaysia.

High Commissioner Dias emphasised the necessity for collaborative efforts to address the existing trade imbalance between the two countries. He highlighted the critical need to bolster Sri Lankan exports to Malaysia and to promote Sri Lanka as a prominent outbound tourism destination for Malaysians.

Furthermore, the National Chairman Datuk William extended an invitation to Sri Lankan chambers and entrepreneurs to participate in the Small and Medium Enterprise Forum, scheduled to be held in October 2024 in Malaysia. This forum is expected to significantly enhance opportunities for Sri Lankan SMEs and the export sector within the Malaysian market.
