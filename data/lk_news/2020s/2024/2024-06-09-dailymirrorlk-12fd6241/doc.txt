No budget proposals for 2025, only interim standard account

Colombo, June 9 (Daily Mirror) - Finance State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said today that he will not present a budget proposal for 2025 and that only an interim standard account will be presented instead.

The Minister said that this is a year when a major election is to be held and that interim standard accounts have been passed before in this manner during such instances.

He said this while speaking to the media in the Ruwanwella area this morning.

According to the budget proposals adopted for 2024, parliamentary approval has been received to carry out revenue expenditure only up to the 31 December 2024, and accordingly, approval should be obtained from a separate budget document for 2025.
