UNWRA thanks Sri Lanka for Gaza funds

ECONOMYNEXT – The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has thanked Sri Lanka for its financial contribution to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA, in a letter addressed to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, “expressed sincere appreciation for Sri Lanka’s substantial financial contribution towards addressing the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip,” a statement by the president’s media division said.

“Lazzarini emphasized the dire situation faced by over two million Palestinians in Gaza, particularly the majority who are Palestine Refugees under UNRWA’s mandate. Despite formidable challenges, UNRWA staff remain steadfast in delivering essential aid, advocating for adherence to international humanitarian law, and ensuring continuous humanitarian support across Gaza.”

The contribution from Sri Lanka to UNRWA “will significantly bolster efforts to address critical humanitarian needs, especially for the more than a million individuals seeking shelter in UNRWA facilities.”

Expressing gratitude for Sri Lanka’s unwavering commitment to Palestine Refugees and to UNRWA, Lazzarini conveyed confidence in continued support from the Sri Lankan government, according to the statement.

The deadline for the Children of Gaza Fund has now been extended until May 31. Originally scheduled to conclude on April 30, the extension follows appeals from across the island.

Those wishing to donate should deposit their contributions to Bank of Ceylon (7010), Taprobane Branch (747), account number 7040016 before the deadline. Donors are also requested to forward the receipt of their deposit to 077-9730396 via WhatsApp, as per the instructions from the Presidential Secretariat. (Colombo/May1/2024)
