Nuwan Thushara takes hat-trick in third Bangladesh T20I

Nuwan Thushara became the fifth Sri Lankan to take a hat-trick in T20I cricket, as he made early breakthroughs to cripple Bangladesh's run chase in the third T20I in Sylhet.

Thushara, bowling his first over in the series, removed Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto, Towhid Hridoy and Mahmadullah -- all deceived by his sling arm action -- to reduce the home team to 15 for 4, chasing a target of 175.

Thushara broke through Shanto's defence and castled the stumps with the second ball of the over, before uprooting the off stump to dismiss Hridoy on the next delivery.

He then completed the hat-trick of wickets when he trapped Mahmadullah leg before wicket, the decision being upheld despite the batsmen's review.

Thushara joins Thisara Perera, Lasith Malinga, Akila Dananjaya and Wanindu Hasaranga as the only Sri Lankans to take a hat-trick in the T20I format.
