Live Updates: 2024 LPL Player Auction

The player auction of the Lanka Premier League 2024 commenced at the Hilton Hotel in Colombo, a short while ago.

A total of 420 players, both Sri Lankan and overseas, will go under the hammer during the much-awaited ‘Player Auction’. Out of the 420 players, 154 are Sri Lankans, while the remaining players are overseas.

In total, the auction will have a collective purse of US$ 2.5 million from all five franchise teams, while each franchise will bring in a sum of US$ 500,000.

The teams will have to ensure that they invest a minimum of 90 per cent of the purse they bring into the auction to form their respective squads.

Charu Sharma, who was the auctioneer of the inaugural LPL player auction held last year, is the auctioneer of this edition as well.
