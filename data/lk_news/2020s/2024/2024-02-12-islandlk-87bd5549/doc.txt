Rocking scene…

It’s certainly going to be a rocking scene on Saturday, March 2nd, at the Gloaming Dinner Dance, in Wohlen, Switzerland, with rock star Chitral Somapala in action.

Singer Suzi Croner (Flückiger), of the band Friends fame, who is now based in Switzerland, has already indicated that she is looking forward to meeting up with Chitral…after almost 30 years!

Suzi, in the meanwhile, keeps entertaining her Swiss fans on a regular basis.

Heading their way to Australia, for their Valentine special, is the group Mirage.

Their first assignment is on Saturday, February 17th, in Melbourne, at the Grand On Princess.

In addition to Mirage, this event, ‘Valentine’s Dinner Dance’ will also feature Noeline Honter and the group Replay-6.

Mirage will also be seen in action at Thai Street Food, in Melbourne, on March 10th, and they would have for company Esric Jackson and No Limit.

I’m also told there is a possibility of Mirage being featured at the popular Walawwa restaurant, in Melbourne, during their one month stay in Australia.

By the way, the Gypsies, too, were in Australia, performing at The Colonial Hotel, in Melbourne, on February 9th, while Sohan Weerasinghe travelled to Singapore, on February 9th…his birthday!
