Magistrate questions CID’s conduct on investigations against Pastor Jerome

The Colombo Fort Magistrate questioned the CID on how they had filed action before the Mount Lavinia Magistrate’s Court against Pastor Jerome Fernando under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, contrary to the accepted court jurisdiction.

Colombo Fort Magistrate Thilina Gamage observed that the CID has no authority to arbitrarily determine the judicial jurisdictions when filing a case, as these jurisdictions have been established through a gazette notification. The magistrate further noted that such a case should have been filed before the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court.

The Magistrate made these remarks when the magisterial inquiry into the controversial Sunday sermon made by Pastor Jerome Fernando was called before court.

The CID informed court that Pastor Jerome Fernando is being investigated into under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and a B report has been filed before the Mount Lavinia Magistrate’s Court.

Pastor Jerome Fernando was present before court and he is currently out on bail. Further magisterial inquiry was fixed for April 3.
