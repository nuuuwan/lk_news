JL Euro Solutions and Pharmaceris successfully conduct hair and skin care solutions awareness program

JL Euro Solutions, the Sole Authorized Representative of Pharmaceris Haircare and Skincare products in Sri Lanka, conducted an informative session on Haircare and Skincare solutions at Hilton Colombo Residences recently.

During the event, a number of experts from Pharmaceris shared their knowledge, expertise and treatment methodologies available in Sri Lanka for the treatment of Alopecia. Alopecia, commonly known as loss of hair, is a growing issue among middle-aged and older Sri Lankans. Research has shown that loss of hair has a negative impact on a person’s mental and emotional health as they may struggle with feelings of unattractiveness and be self conscious in social situations or avoid them altogether. It could cause issues of self esteem and may even lead to depression at times, thereby greatly disrupting the individual’s way of life.
