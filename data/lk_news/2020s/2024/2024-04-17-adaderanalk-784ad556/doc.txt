Price-gouging & verbal hostility: Arrested street food vendor granted bail

The owner of a street food eatery in Aluthkade, who was arrested for price-gouging a foreign tourist and behaving in a verbally aggressive manner, has been granted bail.

When the accused was produced before the court earlier today (17), he was ordered to be released on a cash bail of Rs. 50,000 and surety bail of Rs. 1 million.

On Tuesday (16), the police arrested the 51-year-old in question for trying to charge Rs. 1,900 from a foreigner for a Kottu Roti and verbally harassing him when he refused to buy the food item at the quoted price.

The arrest came hot on the heels of public outcry on social media after a video of the incident went viral.
