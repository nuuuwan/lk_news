No one is talking today of restoring my civic rights: Ranjan

Colombo, Feb 16 (Daily Mirror) - No one is talking today of restoring my lost civic rights, former Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Ranjan Ramanayake said today.

"I have lost my civic rights for seven years. I cannot speak on politics as per the conditional pardon offered by the President. Therefore, I abide by the conditions laid out when the President Ranil Wickremesinghe offered to release me from jail," he added.

Ramanayake who was found guilty of contempt of court in 2021 was released by the incumbent President in 2022.
