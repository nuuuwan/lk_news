An Open Letter Submission to the President, Minister of Finance, Chief of Staff of the President, Minister of Justice, Chairman Public Finance Committee, Secretary to the Treasury, Governor Central Bank, Auditor General, Attorney General, Legal Draftsman, Secretary General Parliament, Diagnostics Team- International Monetary Fund

This submission is made in the long-term sustainable interests of Sri Lanka and all its people; and sets out some critical aspects to be considered by you, prior to proceeding with the enactment of the proposed Economic Transformation Bill.

‘A vibrant literature of empirical growth studies lends support to a variety of views on the conditions and policies that spur growth. Because economic theory does not reach clear conclusions on the conditions that best support income catch-up, researchers have looked for lessons from the experience of a large number of countries over long periods. The challenge is to sift through the voluminous (and at times contradictory) conclusions to identify the most robust influences—those that are repeatedly significant across studies covering different samples, periods, and specifications’[i].

Geographic and socioeconomic attributes constitute nearly 50% of the growth drivers, the balance is shared between initial income per capita and demographic factors such as population growth rates, fertility rates, and age composition and only around 20% relate to policy influences[ii]. ‘These results lead to the troubling conclusion that the scope for policies to affect growth may be rather narrow or influenced by other conditions in ways that are difficult to discern’[iii]. Examples of the variable growth drivers of smaller underdeveloped economies of the Central Eastern European economies[iv] vs the experiences of Bangladesh[v] and East Java[vi] bring out these variable results; and are worthy of your attention in developing the best suited policy reform for economic transformation in Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka’s best option will require a mixed bag of reforms to enhance new investments and tradable goods share of growth, starting with political stability, policy consistency, ease of doing business, improved factor productivity, good governance, safe and corruption free destination with property rights and effective dispute resolution mechanisms, whilst leveraging on developing effective supply chain linkages focused on India and China, and possibly extending to cover options with Asian Tigers. In addition, enhancing per capita incomes of the majority marginal/variable income earners, addressing the specific needs of poor and vulnerable, through new livelihood opportunities led by human resource development, skills upgrading with an acceptable work culture attitudinal change, will in addition lead to enhancement of local consumption led growth; and will require focused training, technology transfers and infrastructure developments, all going beyond the present focus only of reaching debt sustainability.

The above Bill proposes the adoption of a legislated framework by a National Policy on Economic Transformation, setting out long term to be consistently applied macro-economic fundamentals with fixed outcome targets and defined objectives. In addition, the Bill establishes five new public institutions to engineer the required change management and pilot the envisaged economic Transformation along with the repeal of the Board of Investments Law.

‘A country’s comparative advantage cannot lie in keeping its people poor; Bangladesh’s development has largely been driven by one export sector – the ready-made garment industry – which is highly dependent on keeping wages low” the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights[vii] “: Indonesia being an upper-middle income country and member of the G20 has a relatively low and stagnant Human Development Index[viii],whilst in Central Eastern European Countries the human development indices have improved even exceeding comparator indices of developed countries[ix].

The priority, critical strategic question to be addressed by the Executive, Legislature, growth creating private sector, academia and the International Monetary Fund is, whether the enactment of the Bill in its current form, even when supported by a disciplined and focused strategic change management culture, will be capable of delivering consistent and sustainable growth along with the creation of new livelihood options for the majority of the citizens whilst enhancing their disposable incomes. This segment of society is currently drastically impacted by cost of living, hunger, malnutrition, lack opportunities for human development. This failure is in the context of a severe shortage in meeting market needs for a supportive skilled workforce, and an effectively connected efficient national growth facilitative infrastructure. Whilst acknowledging the need for disciplined and strategic change management in the areas as focused by the Bill in reducing the national debt to planned levels and enabling the nation to enter international credit markets, will it simultaneously lead to be a crucial turnaround contributor to spur the realization of the welfare and wellbeing of a majority of citizens whilst focusing on the timely realization of the UN Sustainable Development Goals?

In the enactment of the proposed Bill, with special reference to Part VIII enabled wide and open cart blanche approval and operations facilitative framework, whereas Sri Lanka does not have adequate and comprehensive laws and regulations to control of monopolies, mergers and anti-competitive and anti-trust practices, (with the Consumer Affairs Authority Act being totally inadequate to provide essential protection), there lies an important legislative and regulatory void which requires priority attention of those addressed by this submission.

It is a fervent hope that those addressed will take steps to avoid a possible risks of a tipping point-based peoples’ uprising, by proceeding with the enactment of the Bill ignoring the perceived inequality and the severe hardships poor and vulnerable are exposed to consequent to the economic crisis.

A further preliminary critical issue requiring careful evaluation is to validate whether the five new public institutions proposed to be established can be avoided by effective restructure, change management, infusion of new talent, skills, and professionalism and using existing institutions where necessary with amalgamations and change of objectives and accountabilities. For example, will a restructured Board of Investments be an option? Can an amalgamation of the Institute of Policy Studies/Institute of Fundamental Studies and Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute replace the planned research Institute and can an amalgamated SLINTEC/CISIR/Industrial Development Board/Other Key Research Institutes not be the vehicles to implement the provisions of the Bill.

Without prejudice to the critical issues outlined above this submission attempts to upgrade, expand, make more comprehensive and best practices enriched, the current provisions of the proposed Economic Transformation Bill; embedding within it, the recommendations hereinafter set out, which will ensure greater transparency and accountability and establish an Efficient, Economic and Effective operational framework.
