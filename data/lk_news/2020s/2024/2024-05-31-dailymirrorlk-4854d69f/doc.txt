Colombo, May 31 (Daily Mirror) - The Criminal Investigation Department arrested a wanted suspect, Gerard Pushparaja Osman Gerard, suspected to be the person who co-ordinated the sending of the four alleged ISIS terrorists from Sri Lanka to India and who were arrested in India.

Earlier, the CID announced a reward of Rs. 2 million for information leading to the arrest of the suspect.
