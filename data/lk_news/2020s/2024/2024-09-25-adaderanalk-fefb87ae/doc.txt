Sri Lanka Customs warns against fake recruitment workshops

Sri Lanka Customs says it has received information that certain individuals are engaged in a racket while announcing that they will conduct practice interviews for the recruitment of Assistant Superintendents of Customs.

Customs spokesperson, Additional Director General of Customs, Seevali Arukgoda, stated that no official workshop has been organized for such interviews.

“The Open Competitive Examination for recruitment to the post of Assistant Superintendent of Customs was held recently. Based on the results of the competitive examination, we have called a group of candidates for an interview. This interview is scheduled to be conducted on the 27th, 28th, and 29th of this month,” he said.

He further mentioned that they have recently noticed on social media that some individuals have arranged workshops in preparation for the interview for the recruitment of customs officers.

“We understand that this could be an extortion racket. The reason is that in this interview, marks will be awarded only to those applicants who have won national and international-level sports competitions, “ he said.

“Additionally, marks will be given solely to assess educational qualifications and physical fitness. No additional marks will be awarded for any other criteria.”

“Candidates who have been called for interviews will not need to attend practice workshops or prepare for the interview conducted by Customs,” he added.
