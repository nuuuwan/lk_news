Cabinet nod for proposed housing programme for Sri Lankan overseas employees

The approval of the Cabinet of Ministers has been received to a proposal seeking to implement a housing programme for Sri Lankans employed overseas.

The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) collaborated with the National Housing Development Authority and the licensed banks had planned to implement a housing programme for migrant workers, where it was expected to grant a maximum of Rs. 10 million as a loan grant, and contribute a portion of its loan interest amount by SLBFE.

The loan amount obtained under the proposed loan scheme should be paid by foreign exchange remitted through legitimate channels within the period the loan receiver is engaged in an overseas employment and payments would be made in Sri Lankan rupees once the foreign employment is completed and they return to Sri Lanka.

Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved the proposal submitted by the Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara to implement the proposed housing programme.
