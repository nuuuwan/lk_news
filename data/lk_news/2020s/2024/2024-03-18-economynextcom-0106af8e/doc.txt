Sri Lanka’s NDB plans Rs10bn from debt sale

ECONOMYNEXT – National Development Bank Plc said it was planning to raise upto 10 billion through a Basel III compliant debenture sale.

Subject to the approval of the shareholders, the bank will issue 100,000,000 tier 2, listed, rated, unsecured, subordinated, redeemable debentures with a non-viability conversion of 100 rupees each.

“The 100,000,000 debentures will be issued in one or multiple issuances, the timing of which is within one year time frame from the date of obtaining shareholder approval,” the bank said in a stock exchange filing.

The size, tenure/maturity period (minimum five years), coupon rate/s, frequency of coupon/s, etc, will be notified prior to the opening of such multiple issuances.

In July last year, Fitch Ratings said it was maintaining an ‘A-(lka)’ rating on NDB with a negative rating watch, though domestic debt restructuring has excluded banks.

“We believe risks to Sri Lankan banks’ operating environment (OE) remains high despite the exclusion of the banks’ holdings in Sri Lankan rupee-denominated government securities from the sovereign domestic debt restructuring,” Fitch said at the time.

National Development Bank Plc shares were trading up at 66.20 on Monday. (Colombo/Mar18/2024).
