Ceylinco Cancer Centre unveils refurbished interiors

The Ceylinco Cancer Centre at Park Street, Colombo 2 recently completed a major refurbishment to offer a more comfortable and aesthetically-pleasing environment for visitors. The refurbishment encompassed the entrance and reception, visitors’ lounge, the waiting area for radiation treatment and the waiting area for CT Simulator imaging.

The first standalone radiation therapy centre in Sri Lanka’s private sector when it opened in September 2007, the Ceylinco Cancer Centre is equipped with a state-of-the-art Varian Clinac iX Linear Accelerator for radiation treatment, and recently acquired the latest AI-supported, four-dimensional CT Simulator from Siemens Healthcare GmbH of Germany, exclusively for treatment planning.

Pictured here is the formal reopening of the refurbished Ceylinco Cancer Centre by the Chairman of Ceylinco Healthcare Services Limited (CHSL) R. Renganathan accompanied by the Company’s directors, and the refurbished reception area of the Centre.
