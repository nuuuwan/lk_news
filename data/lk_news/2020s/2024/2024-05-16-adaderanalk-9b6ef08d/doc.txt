Court refuses injunction against Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe

The Colombo District Court today rejected the petition filed by Duminda Dissanayake seeking an interim injunction preventing Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from functioning as the Chairman and Keerthi Udawatta as Acting General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).

Accordingly, the Colombo District Court refused to issue an injunction restraining the party, its organizations and officials from acting on the decision taken to appoint Minister Wijayadasa Rajapakshe as the Chairman and Attorney-at-Law Keerthi Udawatte as the Acting General Secretary of the SLFP.

However, Colombo District Judge Sandun Withana stated that the complainant has the opportunity to amend this plaint and confirm the facts for the relevant injunction.

The District Judge announced this order after considering a petition submitted by MP Duminda Dissanayake, who had been appointed as Acting General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) by the partyâ€™s faction supporting Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva.
