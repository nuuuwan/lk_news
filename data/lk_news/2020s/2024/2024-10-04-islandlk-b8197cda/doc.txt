Pathfinder Foundations launches Sinhala Translation of ‘The India Way: Strategies for an Uncertain World”

The Sinhala translation of  ‘The India Way: Strategies for an Uncertain World’  by Dr. S. Jaishankar, Minister of External Affairs of the Government of India, will be launched in Colombo today. The decade from the 2008 Global Financial Crisis to the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic has significantly transformed the world order. In The India Way’, Dr. S. Jaishankar analyses these challenges and proposes possible policy responses. He places this thinking in the context of history and tradition, appropriate for a civilizational power that seeks to reclaim its place on the world stage.

The Sinhala translation of the book ‘The India Way’ is a publication by the Pathfinder Foundation translated by Ajith Perakum Jayasinghe.

The original publication was undertaken by Delhi-based Harper Collins Publishers India Private Limited, from whom Pathfinder Foundation obtained the license to translate the work into Sinhalese language and print for distribution free of charge.

The book is available free of charge for public libraries and libraries of all universities in the country by contacting pm@Pathfinderfoundation.org or 011 425 9952-3.
