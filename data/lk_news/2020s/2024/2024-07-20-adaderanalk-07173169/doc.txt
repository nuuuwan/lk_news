Addressing an event held at the Ruhuna University, the UGC Chairman assured that the non-academic staff who have been on strike for 75 days will report back for duty from next Monday.

Speaking further, the UGC Chairman said: “The non-academic staff who have been on strike for 75 days will report back for duty from next Monday. The President intervened to provide a solution to their salary disparity. The President should be thanked for that.
