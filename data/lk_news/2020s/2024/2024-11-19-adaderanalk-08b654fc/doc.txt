Fertilizer subsidy delay due to technical issues – Agri. Ministry

The delay in crediting the fertilizer subsidy funds to farmers’ bank accounts is due to a technical issue with the computer system, claims the Ministry of Agriculture.

Accordingly, the Ministry has confirmed that a team of officials was deployed yesterday to investigate the matter and that a report pertaining to the matter is expected to be submitted to the Secretary of the Ministry today (19).

Furthermore, the Ministry of Agriculture mentioned that steps have already been taken to release the fertilizer subsidy to the farmers’ bank accounts.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Rs. 25,000 per farmer is being provided as a subsidy for the purchase of fertilizer required for paddy cultivation during the ongoing ‘Maha’ Season.

However, reports indicate that despite more than 20 days having passed since the start of paddy cultivation in the eastern region, including Ampara, farmers are yet to receive the fertilizer subsidy.

The government has completed the first phase of the fertilizer subsidy, covering 86,162 hectares across 23 districts.

However, due to the delay in the release of water in the Polonnaruwa, Girithale and Kaudulla irrigation reservoirs, the fertilizer subsidy has been delayed in those areas, as per the Ministry of Agriculture.

In response to these challenges, the Ministry of Agriculture has reiterated that corrective measures are underway, and that the efforts are being made to ensure the timely disbursement of funds to farmers.
