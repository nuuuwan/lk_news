Sri Lanka to introduce bill enabling no-fault divorce: Justice minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has drafted a bill to bring about no-fault divorce, the country’s Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.

“We have made a new bill to introduce no-fault divorce,” Rajapaksha said in parliament on Tuesday (23) explaining some of the salient features of a new bill that would include electronic means – email and Whatsapp – of handing over summons.

At present, Sri Lanka’s divorce law is governed by the Marriage Registration Ordinance and is a fault-based divorce and is only possible on grounds of adultery, malicious desertion or incurable impotence.

The fault-based divorce system and grounds for divorce were enacted in 1907 and are still used in cases of non-customary divorce.

“Instead of waiting years for the divorce, if it is proved that there has been an irretrievable marriage breakdown, court can rule on the matter.” (Colombo/Jul23/2024)
