Electricity Users Association files complaint with HRCSL against Electricity Bill

Electricity Users Association has filed a formal complaint with Human Rights Commission Sri Lanka (HRCSL) against the recently gazetted Sri Lanka Electricity Bill, alleging that it violates the rights of electricity users.

The Association’s Secretary Sanjeewa Dhammika outlined that the complaint was filed focusing on five critical concerns regarding the Bill.

He also highlighted that under the proposed legislation, key entities such as the National Energy Advisory Council, National System Operator, National Transmission Grid Service Provider, and Field Strength Renovation Network Service Provider and the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), would fall under the direct purview of the Minister, which will give immense powers to him.

He also highlighted concerns regarding management control resting with the Minister, lack of independent mechanisms and the transfer of regulatory powers to political entities. “The Bill weakens the independence and authority of regulatory bodies like the PUCSL, transferring decision-making powers to political entities and diminishing regulatory oversight,” he charged.

Dhammika argued that this centralised control could potentially jeopardise the interests and rights of over seven million electricity users across the country.

They fear that consolidating such authority under the Minister could lead to reduced transparency, accountability and consumer representation in the management of the electricity sector.

Sri Lanka Electricity Bill, introduced on 17 April, has sparked widespread debate and scrutiny. It is scheduled for presentation in Parliament during the next session, providing a two-week window for public feedback and potential legal challenges before finalisation.
