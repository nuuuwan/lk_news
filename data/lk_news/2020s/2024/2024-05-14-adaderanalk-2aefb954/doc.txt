University non-academic staff withdraw from essential services

The non-academic staff of state universities have decided to withdraw from the essential services of the university system including water and electricity services from today (14).

The strike action launched by the Joint Committee of University Trade Unions continued for the 13th consecutive day today, citing wage issues.

Although the proposals concerning the monthly allowance and wage disparities of university non-academic staff was tabled during the Cabinet meeting which was held on Monday (13), the granting of approval for the proposals were further delayed, since it has been decided to seek approval from the Ministry of Finance for the matters outlined in the proposal.

Accordingly, the relevant proposal is expected to be resubmitted to the Cabinet following approval from the Ministry of Finance.
