PUCSL to reach decision on proposed electricity tariffs next week

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) is scheduled to address the proposed revision of electricity tariffs by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) in a meeting on 22 January.

A final decision on the matter is anticipated at this meeting, following which the proposal and the PUCSLâ€™s decision will be made public for a three-week period.

The PUCSL will then modify the proposal based on public feedback and submit the final tariff revision to the CEB.

Meanwhile, speaking at a press briefing held today (20 Jan.), the CEB affirmed that electricity tariffs would be adjusted promptly upon approval from the PUCSL.
