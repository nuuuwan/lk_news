Cabinet moves to cut costs of MPs and ex-Presidents privileges

Appoints three-member committee to study entitlements and make suitable recommendations to either limit them or propose alternative methods to ease burden on Treasury

In response to growing concerns over the high cost of maintaining entitlements for Members of Parliament (MPs), Ministers and former Presidents, the Cabinet of Minister at their meeting on Monday approved reviewing and potentially reducing the privileges they receive.

The move comes as the Government seeks to ease the burden on public finances, which have been stretched due to fiscal constraints.

“Currently MPs, Ministers and ex-Presidents are provided with a range of entitlements and allowances, including salaries, pensions, housing, vehicles, staff, office equipment and security personnel. These benefits come at a significant cost to the Government, funded by public taxes,” Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Vijitha Herath said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

He said a three-member committee Chaired by Retired Judge K.T. Chitrasiri along with retired Ministry Secretary D. Dissanayake and retired District Secretary Jayantha C.T. Bulumulla were appointed to study the current entitlements and make suitable recommendations to either limit them or propose alternative methods that could ease the burden on the Treasury.

“Our aim is to rationalise these expenses,” he said, disclosing that some of the MPs have enjoyed entitlements even when they are no longer a MPs.

The committee is expected to submit a detailed report within two months, outlining recommendations for reforming the system in a way that aligns with the Government’s fiscal capacity.

“The review will assess which benefits are essential and which creates an unnecessary financial strain on public resources,” Herath said, noting that by the time the General Election is over the Government can then take necessary measures to address the loopholes.
