Starlink internet pre-orders open in Sri Lanka

Colombo, May 27 (Daily Mirror) - Elon Musk's Starlink internet is now open for pre-order in Sri Lanka, with the public able to reserve Starlink by paying a fully refundable USD 9 deposit.

Starlink aims to commence service in Sri Lanka in 2024, pending regulatory approval.

Orders will be fulfilled on a first-come, first-served basis within each coverage area.

Starlinkâ€™s Internet Constellation is one of the biggest breakthroughs in commercial satellite history. It brings nearly broadband-capable speeds and performance using a novel configuration of small satellites that work as a constellation while orbiting the Earth much lower than traditional satellites.

Earlier, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that Elon Musk had sent an application to launch the Starlink service in Sri Lanka and preliminary work to bring Starlink to Sri Lanka has been completed.
