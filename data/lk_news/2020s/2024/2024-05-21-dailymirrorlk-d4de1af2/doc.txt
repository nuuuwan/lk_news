Kusal Mendis secures visa to USA after delay

May 21 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lankan cricketer Kusal Mendis, whose visa was delayed for travel to the USA for the T20 World Cup, is finally set to depart after receiving approval for his visa.

Despite the rest of the squad having already left for the USA, Mendis' visa was held up at the US Embassy in Colombo for several days due to incomplete documentation.

The delay was attributed to Mendis' failure to submit several required documents to the embassy.

Earlier, in response to reports that Kusal Mendis' visa was denied, CEO Ashley de Silva said that Mendis' visa was not denied and that he would join the team before the warm-up games.

Sri Lanka is scheduled to play two warm-up matches ahead of the ICC Menâ€™s T20 World Cup 2024, commencing on May 28.

Their first warm-up game against the Netherlands will take place on May 28 at Broward County Stadium in Florida. They will then face Ireland in their second warm-up game on May 31 at the same venue.
