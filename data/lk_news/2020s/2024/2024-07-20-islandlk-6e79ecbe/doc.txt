‘Leopards, people and everything…’

As we approach Sri Lanka Leopard Day on August 1, the WNPS is delighted to welcome Dr. Jeannine Stephanie McManus, a global expert in human-wildlife conflict mitigation, to share her insights on fostering human-leopard coexistence in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan leopard, found both inside and outside protected areas, faces increasing challenges that threaten its survival. Dr. McManus’s expertise offers valuable perspectives on addressing these issues.

Dr. McManus is affiliated with the Landmark Foundation, a conservation organization in South Africa, that promotes and facilitates conservation land uses. The leopard is central to the Landmark Foundation owing to its iconic status as the last remaining top predator naturally occurring in South African mountain ranges.

She is a leader in restoration ecology, species conservation, and resolving human-wildlife conflicts. As Acting Director of the Landmark Foundation Leopard and Predator Conservation Project, she has spearheaded initiatives to create wildlife-friendly landscapes and reduce conflicts between humans and carnivores. Her work with the Landmark Foundation includes collaborating with planters and livestock farmers to promote human-leopard coexistence, a WNPS news release said.

The Landmark Foundation has successfully collared and monitored 73 leopards, working closely with farming communities to minimize conflict. Dr. McManus’s extensive experience and dedication to conservation will significantly enhance efforts to protect the Sri Lankan leopard.

In her role as a Research Affiliate at the University of the Western Cape, Dr. McManus supervises students and develops innovative projects in ecology and conservation biology. Her leadership in projects like “Shepherding Back Biodiversity” showcases her ability to integrate ecological health with agricultural practices, promoting coexistence between humans and wildlife.

The monthly lecture of the WNPS is supported by Nations Trust Bank. Dr. McManus’s visit is made possible with the kind support of Dilmah Conservation and Jetwing Hotels.

The lecture is open to both members and non-members, with free entrance. Join us on July 25th for a transformative NTB WNPS Lecture by Dr. Jeannine and discover innovative solutions for human-leopard coexistence in Sri Lanka.
