Probe launched into fake website similar to Election Commissionâ€™s official website

The Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (SL CERT) has launched an investigation into a fake website similar to the official Election Commission website.

Senior Information Engineer Charuka Damunupola of SL CERT confirmed that a complaint has also been lodged with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) regarding this issue.

Meanwhile, the Election Commission announced that the period for accepting postal voting applications for the upcoming presidential election ended at midnight yesterday (09).

Although the relevant period was scheduled to end at midnight on the August 7, steps were taken to extend the period of accepting applications in consideration of possible mail delays and requests made to the commission.
