ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka hopes to avoid repaying debt till December 2027 under restructuring talks underway and repay them in the period running up to 2042, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.

“We are in discussions to restructure all debt including foreign debt. We hope to end these discussions in the near future,” President Wickremesinghe told parliament Tuesday.
