Starlink: Govt. initiates drafting new telecommunication regulations

In the wake of plans by tech baron Elon Musk to visit Sri Lanka later this year, the government has initiated the process of evolving fresh regulations to facilitate the launch of Starlink satellite internet service, a Minister said yesterday.

The President held talks with Musk, the billionaire head of Tesla and SpaceX and owner of social platform X and invited him to visit Sri Lanka.

State Minister of Technology Kanaka Herath told Daily Mirror that an application had been sent in March, this year for the launch of Starlink in Sri Lanka.

“We are now in the process of drafting new regulations,” he said.
