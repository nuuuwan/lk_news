EC directs to remove election campaign offices at electorate level

The Chairman of the Election Commission, R.M.A.L. Rathnayake, says that all election campaign offices which have been established at the electorate level must be removed after midnight today (19).

During a press conference at the Department of Government Information this morning (19) regarding the presidential poll, he stated that it is essential to remove all current election campaign offices at the constituency level from midnight today.

“Up until yesterday, the maintaining of one main office for the district and one for each constituency related to a polling station had been allowed. However, from midnight today, only one office per election division or district and one for a polling area or previous electoral electorate can be kept open.

“If these offices are not removed, the police will proceed to remove them,” he added.

He also said that a candidate’s residence can be maintained as an office, but if the residence or the office is located within 500 meters of a polling center, all campaign materials must be removed before voting begins on September 21.

“Also, if the candidate’s house is within that limit, the decorations and promotional material in the house must be removed,” R.M.A.L. Rathnayake said.
