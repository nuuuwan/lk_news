Modi inaugurates Indiaâ€™s longest cable-stayed bridge in Gujarat

NEW DELHI, Feb 25 (Times of India) - Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently inaugurated the Sudarshan Setu, a monumental cable-stayed bridge that spans approximately 2.32 km, connecting the Okha mainland to Beyt Dwarka in Gujarat. This bridge, formerly known as the 'Signature Bridge,' has been renamed Sudarshan Setu.

Situated near the Okha port, Beyt Dwarka is an island about 30 km from Dwarka town, home to the famous Dwarkadhish temple dedicated to Lord Krishna.

Referred to as India's longest cable-stayed bridge, Sudarshan Setu holds immense importance for both residents and pilgrims, especially those visiting the revered Dwarkadhish Temple. Prime Minister Modi, accompanied by Gujarat chief minister Bhupendra Patel, marked the inauguration as a momentous occasion for Gujarat's developmental journey.

The project, initiated by the Centre in 2017, aims to simplify access for devotees commuting between Okha and Bet Dwarka, eliminating the need for boat transport. The 2.5 km bridge, constructed at a cost of Rs 978 crore, showcases a distinctive design with a footpath adorned with verses from the Bhagavad Gita and images of Lord Krishna. Notably, it features solar panels on the upper portions of the footpath, generating one megawatt of electricity.

In a social media post, Prime Minister Modi expressed anticipation for the bridge's impact on Gujarat's growth trajectory, emphasizing its role in enhancing connectivity. The Sudarshan Setu is poised to make pilgrimages to the Dwarkadhish Temple more accessible and convenient for the devotees.
