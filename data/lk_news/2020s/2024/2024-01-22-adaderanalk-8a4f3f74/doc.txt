The senior oncologist of the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, who was arrested and remanded for allegedly assaulting a female junior staff member, has been granted bail.

61-year-old Dr. Krishantha Perera was granted bail on orders of the Galle Magistrate’s Court today (22 Jan.) on two personal bonds of Rs. 1 million each.

The relevant order was issued by Galle Magistrate Isuru Neththikumara.

Meanwhile, the three minor staff members of the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, including a female, who were arrested on 21 January in connection with a complaint by Dr. Perera alleging assault, are under remand custody until 29 January.

The court also ordered that the three suspects be referred to an identification parade on the aforementioned date.

The senior oncologist in question, Dr. Krishantha Perera, 61, was arrested on 18 January for purportedly assaulting a female junior staff member during a contentious situation that had ensued the previous morning.

He was accused of assaulting the said staff member during a heated argument between him and the other junior staffers after he slammed them for disrupting hospital services by going on a token strike the day before.

The hospital’s authorities had brought the situation under control, however, a female junior staff member got herself admitted to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, claiming an assault by the senior oncologist who was subsequently arrested and remanded until January 22 on the orders of the Galle Magistrate.
