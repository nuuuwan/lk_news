Sri Lanka mulls agency to regulate transport of goods and services on inland waterways

ECONOMYNEXT – A parliamentary committee have discussed setting up an agency to regulate the transport of goods and services on Sri Lanka’s inland waterways.

The Sectoral Oversight Committee on Energy and Transport met in Parliament recently.

“Since Sri Lanka is an island, transportation by waterways can be encouraged as a remedy to reduce the traffic congestion during the period when office services start in the morning around the city of Colombo,” a Parliament statement said.

Although there had been discussions on how to carry out transportation through waterways for a long time, no formal system had been prepared, Madhura Withanage pointed out.

The statement did not say whether any attempts were made to find out whether existing state agencies could handle the task.

The Committee, Chaired by Nalaka Bandara Kottegoda, discussed “the non-operation of the advanced water transportation system that existed in this country before the colonial era,” and pointed out that it is “important to prepare a suitable system for this purpose”.

The Committee instructed officials that it is important to establish an institution to regulate the transport of goods and services through inland waterways and to take necessary steps for that purpose.

Officials were to inform the Committee regarding the progress on the said within a month.

State Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna and committee members Dayasiri Jayasekara, Udayakantha Gunathilaka, Yadamini Gunawardena and Withanage were at the meeting.

Sri Lanka already has a national transport commission. The country is also in the process of privatizing many state-owned enterprises.

After an economic crisis, and an International Monetary Fund bailout, Sri Lanka has imposed various taxes including an increased value added tax and a tax on incomes above 100,000. (Colombo/Jul17/2024)
