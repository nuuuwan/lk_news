Sri Lanka to bring National Cyber Security Act amid surge in social network users: State minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is in the process of drafting a National Cyber Security Act, as social network users rise, State Minister for Technology Kanaka Herath said.

“The user base across all social networks has surged from 60 million to 74 million. There is an imperative for a National Cyber Security Act. Plans are underway to draft pertinent legislation by May 2024,” Herath told reporters at the Presidential Media Centre.

“Collaborative efforts involving 29 government agencies, alongside Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (SL CERT), have been undertaken to strengthen cyber security.”

The minister said that the cabinet has endorsed the National Digital Strategy 2030, which focused on infrastructure, connectivity, access, skills, literacy, industries, jobs, and establishing a connected digital government.

“Emphasis is placed on cyber security, data security, privacy, digital financial services, and the digitization of small and medium-sized businesses.”

On Friday a bill to amend the Telecommunications Regulatory Act will be submitted to parliament, Herath said.

“Previously, regulations concerning undersea cables were non-existent. Now, legislation addressing this matter has become feasible.”

Sri Lanka also passed the Online Safety Act No. 9 of 2024 which seeks to regulate online discourse. The controversial bill on which many provisions were struck down by the Supreme Court as violating the constitution was passed in February with amendments. (Colombo/May9/2024)
