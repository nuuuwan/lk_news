‘March 12 Movement’ opens Presidential debate for public questions

‘The March 12 Movement’, a civic initiative focused on promoting clean and ethical politics, has called on members of the public to submit their questions to be posed to Presidential candidates during the upcoming public debate series organised by the movement.

‘The March 12 Movement’ has announced that a series of Presidential candidate debates will begin on 7 September in Colombo. The Movement has invited members of the public to submit their questions for the candidates. The debates, it said, will provide a platform for the candidates to present their political ideologies and programs, while also giving the public the opportunity to ask pressing questions directly.

Building on the success of the first Presidential candidate public debate held in 2019, this year’s debate series has been expanded, with all candidates invited to participate.

Questions can be submitted by post to the Institute of Democratic Reforms and Electoral Studies (IRES), located at No 15/22, Chandra Wettasinghe Mawatha, 3rd Lane, Koswatta, Rajagiriya, through a Google form at https://bit.ly/PresidentialDebate2024, or by email to [email protected]

The organisation emphasised that public questions should focus on key issues facing the country. The deadline for submissions is 31 August 2024.
