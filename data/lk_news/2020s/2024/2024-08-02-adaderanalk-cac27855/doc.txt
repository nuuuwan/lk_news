The Supreme Court today fixed for consideration on August 09 the petition filed by the former Director of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) Shani Abeysekera, seeking an order to provide adequate protection to him as there is a threat to his life.

The court also ordered to send notices to the respondents of the petition including Deshabandu Tennakoon, who served as the IGP, and Defence Secretary Kamal Gunaratne to appear before the court on that date.

The relevant petition was taken up before the three-member Supreme Court judge bench consisting of Justices Vijith Malalgoda, Murdu Fernando and Yasantha Kodagoda this morning (02).

During today’s court proceedings, President’s Counsel Upul Jayasuriya who appeared for the petitioner stated before the court that information has been received regarding a conspiracy to assassinate his client in a staged car accident, highlighting that there is a possibility that Shani Abeysekera’s life could be in danger at any moment.

The President’s Counsel, who further stated that the current security provided to his client is not sufficient in this situation, requested that an order be issued to provide adequate security that can safeguard his life.

The three-member judge bench, who took into consideration all the facts presented, ordered that notice be issued for the respondents of the case to present facts before the court on August 09, 2024.

A group including Deshabandu Tennakoon, the National Police Commission and the Defence Secretary have been named as respondents of the relevant petition.
