Customs work-to-rule action called off

The Customs trade unions have decided to call of their work-to-rule action today (Feb. 16).

On Thursday (15), the Trade Union Alliance of Sri Lanka Customs had launched the work-to-rule campaign over several demands including solutions to their issues such as stalled promotions and discrepancies in wages.

However, the work-to-rule action was called-off after the discussions held with the State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya and Presidentâ€™s Secretary Saman Ekanayake ended on a positive note, as per the trade unions.
