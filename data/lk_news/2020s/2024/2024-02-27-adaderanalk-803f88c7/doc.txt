Productivity & Marketing Division to be discontinued due to ‘unproductivity’

Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has given instructions to do away with the Productivity & Marketing Division operating under the purview of the Agrarian Development Department with immediate effect.

The directives were given to the Commissioner General of Agrarian Development after the lawmaker was informed of the ‘unproductivity’ of the division.

It has also come to light that the division continues to reclaim paddy lands despite the temporary ban imposed on the practice last year.

Last year, Minister Amaraweera gave directives to temporarily halt giving permission to reclaim paddy land. As such, reclamation of paddy land is permitted only with the special permission of the Agriculture Ministry.
