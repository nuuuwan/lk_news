Sri Lanka could lose US$ 50 bn from extreme weather conditions: Ruwan

Feb 15 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka is slated to lose US$ 50 billion with 87 percent of its population potentially facing extreme weather conditions within the next two decades, Presidential Advisor on climate change Ruwan Wijewardene told a top gathering.

Speaking during the South Asia Hydromet Forum, Wijewardene said Sri Lanka is a country which is significantly affected by weather related losses.

“Sri Lanka, significantly affected by weather-related losses and had incurred damages nearing US$7 billion from 1990 to 2018. Looking ahead, we face an even starker reality: by 2050, an expected 7.7% GDP decline in Sri Lanka could translate to a loss of US$50 billion, with 87% of our population potentially facing extreme weather conditions,” he said.
