Leakage of water in Samanalawewa reservoir cannot be stopped, say officials

The leakage of water in the Samanalawewa reservoir cannot be stopped, Ceylon Electricity Board’s accessory manufacturing arm Sri Lanka Energies Private Limited (SLE) said.

The SLE told the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Energy and Transport that met on Tuesday at the Parliamentary complex that even though various measures have been taken to prevent the continuous water leakage, no result has yet been found.

They also told the committee that a ‘covert operation’ is also being carried out by a group under the pretense of preventing the water spill.
