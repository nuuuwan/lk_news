CSE partners with SLIM to promote capital market education among students

The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) recently to enhance collaborative efforts in advancing educational initiatives and professional development. This effort will ultimately provide students with the enhanced access and preparation necessary to recongise and capitalise on opportunities within the financial sector.

The objective of this MOU is to include a Capital Market Module for the Post Graduate Diploma in Marketing program and facilitate guest sessions in other courses of SLIM, designed and offered through the CSE Branches in collaboration with SLIM.
