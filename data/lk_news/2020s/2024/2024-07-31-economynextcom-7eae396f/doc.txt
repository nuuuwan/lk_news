Sri Lanka President’s allies claim support of 95 members

ECONOMYNEXT – Allies of Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe has claimed the support of at least 95 members of the parliamentary group of the government, following a meeting on Tuesday.

Around 92 members of the parliamentary group attended the meeting, indicating their support, the President’s media unit said in a statement.

Bandula Gunawardana, Prasanna Ranatunga and Arundika Fernando did not attend as they were abroad, Ashu Marasinghe, an ally of the President told a late night talk show at Sri Lanka’s Derana television.

“The government parliamentary group is made up of 123 members,” Marasinghe claimed. “So that means 77 percent have come to support President.”

The Sri Lanka Podujana Party is split over the presidential candidate after its executive committee decided not to support Wickremesinghe.
