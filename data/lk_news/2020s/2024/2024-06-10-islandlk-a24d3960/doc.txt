London scene for Benjy

Dynamic bassist Benjamin (Benjy) Ranabahu is in London, on vacation.

He left towards the end of last month (May) and says he will be in London till the end of June.

The purpose of his visit is to see his loved ones, family and friends.

Benjy also checked out the stage play ‘MJ the Musical’  and was enthralled by the stage performers who, literally, made Michael Jackson come alive on stage.

They were all British actors, said Benjy, adding that he enjoyed the show thoroughly.

He also mentioned that he has made plans to go for The Drifters concert.

The Drifters are an American pop and R&B/soul vocal group famous for their hits, such as ‘Saturday Night at the Movies’, ‘Under the Boardwalk’ and ‘Save the Last Dance for Me.’

Benjy also indicated that he will be celebrating his birthday, in July, on the beach, at Mount Lavinia.

Yes, he loves spending his free time, with friends, on the beach, and the beach, at Mount Lavinia, is his favourite spot!
