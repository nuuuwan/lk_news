Environmentalists urge public to protect pets from fireworks

Colombo, April 13 (Daily Mirror) -As the Sinhala and Tamil festive season approaches, environmentalists in Sri Lanka have sounded the alarm on the detrimental impact of fireworks on pets and wildlife.

According to Environmentalist Nayanaka Ranwella, research indicates that fireworks not only disturb the peace of humans but also have profound effects on wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals, including dogs and cats.

The loud explosions can cause birds to abandon their nests in fear, disrupting their habitats.

According to studies, animals have a far more acute sense of hearing than humans, making them particularly sensitive to the deafening blasts of fireworks.

With explosions reaching up to 190 decibels—far surpassing the threshold for human hearing damage at 75 decibels—the sound can induce anxiety, confusion and panic in animals.

Furthermore, researches suggest that up to 50 percent of dogs experience fear or anxiety during fireworks displays.

The combination of loud noises and large crowds can be overwhelming for pets, prompting environmentalists to urge pet owners to keep their furry companions safe at home during firework events.
