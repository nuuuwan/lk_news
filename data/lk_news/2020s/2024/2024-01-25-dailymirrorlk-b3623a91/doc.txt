PUCSL tells CEB to submit proposal before Feb. 12

Colombo, Jan 25 (Daily Mirror) - After considering the favourable hydroelectric storage and profits earned during the year ending December 2023, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) was directed by the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) to submit a tariff proposal.

Accordingly, the end user and bulk supply tariff proposals by the CEB for January to March 2024 were received by the PUCSL on January 16, 2024. Subsequently, though the Commission had requested certain clarifications from the CEB, the information is yet to be received.

The Commission wishes to consult the stakeholders as required under Section 30(3) of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act (SLEA) on the proposed tariff structure and the associated costs. The process is to be launched as early as possible to ensure the timely implementation of the tariff revision.

Any further analysis by the Commission on fresh information submitted by the CEB will be uploaded on the Commission's website during the stakeholder consultation period.

Stakeholders are requested to provide their comments on the proposed forecast costs by the CEB for 2024 and the proposed tariff structure (3.34% reduction) by the CEB.

Meanwhile, the CEB said that all comments should be sent on or before February 12, 2024, in writing via email, fax or post. An oral consultation session is scheduled to be held on February 15, 2024, in Colombo.
