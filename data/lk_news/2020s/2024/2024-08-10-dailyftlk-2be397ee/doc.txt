The President and Executive Committee of the Sri Lanka – Greater Mekong Business Council (SLGMBC) of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce recently held a meeting with Ambassador of Thailand Paitoon Mahapannaporn and Counsellor of Thailand to Sri Lanka Prangtip Kongridhisuksakorn.

The discussion focused on enhancing economic cooperation and exploring new investment opportunities between Thailand and Sri Lanka under the activation of the FTA signed.

During the meeting, both parties identified several key areas for collaboration including boosting tourism, agriculture, fisheries and healthcare sectors, as well as increasing bilateral trade and investment.

Ambassador Paitoon highlighted “Thailand as a gateway to the ASEAN and Mekong sub-region, and Sri Lanka as a gateway to South Asia” for potential cooperation in all sectors. One of the highlights was the potential to attract investment from Thailand in Sri Lanka’s agricultural sector, including production, processing, and distribution. The SLGMBC remains committed to fostering these discussions and implementing the strategies discussed, paving the way for strengthened economic ties and mutual growth between the two nations.
