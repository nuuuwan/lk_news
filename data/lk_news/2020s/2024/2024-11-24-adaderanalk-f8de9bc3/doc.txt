CEB employees demand bonuses by December

The Ceylon Electricity Board Workers’ Union has called on the CEB management to distribute bonuses to employees, citing the board’s profitability.

The union’s General Secretary Ranjan Jayalal stated that a formal letter has been sent to the CEB Chairman, urging action to ensure bonuses are paid before December 10. The letter emphasized that while employees were denied bonuses in recent years due to reported losses, the board’s current profitability warrants sharing the financial benefits with its workforce.

The union further criticized the management for its lack of action over the past two years regarding employee bonuses, despite claims of financial improvement.
