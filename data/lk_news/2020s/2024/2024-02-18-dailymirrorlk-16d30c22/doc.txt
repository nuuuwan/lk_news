Even our leader should not get misled by con men: Chaminda Wijesiri

Colombo, Feb. 18 (Daily Mirror)- Even Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leader Sajith Premadasa should not get misled by those who join the party for their benefits, former SJB MP Chaminda Wijesiri said today.

"There are some politicians who have become independent after the country's economic downfall and then join new political parties. Our leaders should not welcome these political prostitutes. They will destroy the party if they are welcomed," the former MP said.

He said there is nothing wrong in people taking to the streets and launching struggles against false political alliances," he told journalists.
