Sri Lanka defeated Namibia by 77 runs in Kimberley

Jan. 24 (ICC) - In the 12th match of the ICC Under-19 World Cup at Diamond Oval in Kimberley, Sri Lanka secured a commanding 77-run victory over Namibia, showcasing a blend of robust batting and incisive bowling.

The Eagles kept Sri Lanka in check with their tight lines and ensured that the run rate crept at less than two in the first seven overs. Under pressure, Pulindu Perera tried to steal a quick single and was run out by a brilliant teamwork from Peter-Daniel Blignaut, who ran in from point to throw the ball at the non-striker's end, and Junior Kariata, who managed to break stumps despite being awkwardly placed.

The Island nation were then rocked by Zacheo van Vuuren, who brought two wickets in his first two overs. Sineth Jayawardena's minimal foot movement meant that he was unable to cover one that came in, while Ravishan de Silva was brilliantly held by JW Visagie after he nicked one to the keeper's right.

Rusanda Gamage tried to add initiative with a couple of boundaries, but eventually fell for 17 while trying to lift van Vuuren over third. The pacer had his fourth when he got the important wicket of Dinura Kalupahana. Sri Lanka's talented all-rounder chipped one into covers at the end of the 20th over.

Namibia's bowling attack stuck to attacking lines and kept picking wickets after the 20-over mark. Hansie de Villiers struck thrice with his off-spin and helped the African side run through the tail. Only Supun Waduge stood out with his 56*.

Sri Lanka struck early in response. Garuka Sanketh bowled Gerhard Janse van Rensburg (0) with a peach when Namibia were yet to open their account. Hansie de Villiers and JW Visagie batted watchfully against the skilful Sri Lanka bowlers.

A freak run out in the eighth over started a slide that swayed the game in Sri Lanka's favour. It all began with JW Visagie trying to get past the covers against Sanketh. The ball was intercepted by Perera, and thrown back to the bowler's end. Visagie was yet to make his ground, when it hit Sanketh's hand and ricocheted off to the stumps. A procession of wickets began, as Namibia slipped from 15/1 to 21/6 in 38 balls. Kalupahana and Vishwa Lahiru shared two wickets each in this period.

Namibia lost two more before the 20th over mark to Ruvishan Perera. An 18-run stand for the ninth wicket, helped ensure that Namibia wouldn't fall to the second-lowest total in the tournament's history. However, Namibia's loss was merely a formality after Ruvishan struck for the third time to account for Hanro Badenhorst (11).

The African side were bowled out for 56, their second-lowest total in the U19 World Cup history.
