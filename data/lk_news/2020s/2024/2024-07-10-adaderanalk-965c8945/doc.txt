Striking railway workers given deadline to report to duty

The General Manager of Sri Lanka Railways has warned that all Station Masters and Railway Controllers who fail to report to duty by 12.00 noon today (10) will be considered as having vacated their positions.

Accordingly, all the striking Railway Station Masters and Railway Controllers are instructed to report for duty at their respective railway stations or at least to the nearest railway station.

The Sri Lanka Railways Station Masters’ Union had decided to launch a strike action from midnight yesterday (09) based on several demands including promotions.

As a result, several trains including the office trains and night mail trains to and from Colombo Fort and Badulla, to and from Trincomalee, to and from Batticaloa and night mail train to Rambukkana were cancelled, the department said.

However, the Secretary of the Ministry of Transport Ranjith Rubasinghe emphasised that since public transport including railway services have been declared as essential services, the strike launched by the Station Masters’ Union is illegal.

Furthermore, he stated that strict disciplinary action would be taken against those who are not reporting for duty.

Rubasinghe also expressed that if any disruption occurs to the operation of office trains today (10) due to the strike situation, necessary steps have been taken to deploy more Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) buses.

He highlighted that free transportation will be provided on SLTB buses for the passengers who have obtained train season tickets.
