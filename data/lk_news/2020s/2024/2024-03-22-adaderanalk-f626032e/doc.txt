AG to provide full investigation report on ‘Mahaviru Day’ celebrations held so far

The Attorney General has informed the Court of Appeal that it expects to submit a comprehensive investigation report on all ‘Mahaviru Day’ celebrations held to date, commemorating the cadres of the now-defunct separatist group Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam’s (LTTE) in the Northern and Eastern provinces.

Appearing on behalf of the Attorney General, Senior State Counsel Shaminda Wickrema communicated this to the court when a writ petition filed by Ananda Jayamanna, a former officer of Sri Lanka Army Intelligence Unit, seeking legal action against and prohibition of ‘Mahaviru Day’ celebrations, was taken up on Thursday (22).

The petition was heard before the two-member trial bench consisting of Justices S.U.B. Karaliyadda and Mayadunne Corea.

Giving an undertaking before the court previously, the Senior State Counsel, had pledged to take legal action against the ‘Mahaviru Day’ celebrations held in last November.

Thus, when the relevant petition was called yesterday, the attorneys of the petitioning party informed the court that there is no need to maintain this petition further as the prosecution has already given an undertaking. Therefore, they also sought permission to withdraw the relevant petitions.

At the time, Senior State Counsel Wickrema revealed that he intends to present to the court a full report on the investigations carried out by the Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) regarding the ‘Mahaviru Day’ celebrations held so far in the Northern and Eastern provinces. He also requested the court to consider approving the withdrawal of the petition after the report was submitted to the court.

Accordingly, the Appellate Court bench, instructing the Senior State Counsel to present the relevant investigation report to the court, ordered that the request to withdraw the petition be considered following the submission of the said report.
