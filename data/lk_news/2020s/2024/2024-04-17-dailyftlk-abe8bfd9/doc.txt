CEAT Kelani launches 3 new radial tyre variants in ‘Orion Brawo’ range

Sri Lanka’s leading pneumatic tyre manufacturer CEAT-Kelani has introduced three new variants of high-performance radial tyres into the market, widening choice for a significant segment of vehicle owners.

Joining CEAT’s ‘Orion Brawo’ range, the new radials are in the sizes 155/65 R14, 165/70 R14 and 165 R13, with the first two sizes designated for popular models of compact and small cars, and the third for mid-sized vans, the company said.

The CEAT Orion Brawo 155/65 R14 and 165/70 R14 tyres both feature a tread pattern of a centre rib with three circumferential grooves and a high land area, which translate to improved tread life and higher resistance to impacts, cuts and other damage.

The 155/65 R14 is designed for Suzuki Wagon R, Daihatsu Mira ES, Daihatsu Hijet, Nissan Dayz and Honda N-WGN, while the 165/70 R14 fits Toyota Vitz, Toyota Aqua, Renault Kwid and Toyota Passo, seen in large numbers on Sri Lankan roads.

Meanwhile the CEAT Orion Brawo 165 R13 van radial sports a 4-rib high land design, angular notched rib pattern, a wide solid kerb rib and a highly reinforced belt that combine to deliver improved tread life, better durability, resistance to cutting and chipping and better load bearing. It is designed for Toyota Town Ace, Toyota Lite Ace and several other models of vans.

The addition of these three tyres takes CEAT’s radial tyre portfolio in Sri Lanka to 58 variants, the company said.

“The launch of these tyres reflects our continuing commitment to cater to the tyre requirements of the full spectrum of vehicles in Sri Lanka, from the high-end European sedans and SUVs to the smaller family cars and vans,” CEAT Kelani Chief Operating Officer Shamal Gunawardene said. “The Orion range is priced to be affordable and competitive in the market, and is available at our dealer outlets island-wide.”

The largest domestic manufacturer of cross-ply and radial tyres in Sri Lanka, CEAT Kelani’s manufacturing operations encompass pneumatic tyres in the radial (passenger cars, vans and SUVs), commercial (Bias-ply and radial), motorcycle, three-wheeler and agricultural vehicle segments.

CEAT Kelani Holdings currently manufactures half of Sri Lanka’s pneumatic tyre requirements, exports about 20% of its production to 16 countries and plays a significant role in helping the national economy conserve foreign exchange by reducing dependence on imported tyres.
