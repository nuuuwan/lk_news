Sri Lanka stocks close down for fifth consecutive day

ECONOMYNEXT – The Colombo Stock Exchange closed down on Friday, data on its site showed.

The All Share Price Index was down 0.09 percent, or 9.07 points, at 10,610.

The S&P SL20 index was down 0.21 percent, or 6.39 points, at 3,022.

Turnover was lower than the previous day at 567 million. Most of this came from trades in the capital goods industry (120mn), followed by the food, beverage and tobacco industry (111mn).

Market participants said there was some interest in blue-chip companies, such as CTC and Hayleys, possibly due to bargain-hunting in these counters.

Top positive contributors to the ASPI were Ceylon Tobacco Company Plc (up at 1.015.50), Hayleys Plc (up at 74.90), and Expolanka Holdings Plc (up at 142.25).

Teejay Lanka Plc was the most traded and closed up at 37.50. Dialog Axiata Plc also saw active volumes being traded, but closed flat at 8.80.

The banking sector as a whole suffered in the day’s trade, with market participants attributing it to a lack of news on the debt restructuring progress.

The net foreign outflow in the market continued, with an outflow of 88mn registered today. (Colombo/Jan12/2024).
