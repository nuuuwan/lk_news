Cabinet clears to draft bill for National Teachers Council

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved to direct the Legal Draftsman to a bill for the formation of a National Teachers Council.

The decision aligns with the National Education Policy Framework’s recommendation to establish such a council, following global best practices and aiming to elevate the professionalism and quality of teachers through ongoing professional growth opportunities.

“A preliminary draft has been prepared to pave the way for the establishment of the National Teachers Council,” the statement comprising weekly Cabinet decisions issued by the Government Information Department noted.

The joint proposal was put forth by President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Education Minister Dr. Susil Premajayantha.
