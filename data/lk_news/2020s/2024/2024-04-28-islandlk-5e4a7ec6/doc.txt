Colombo International Tea Convention to drive global dialogue on tea as a lifestyle and a livelihood

The Colombo International Tea Convention will be held from the 24th to the 26th July 2024, bringing together the biggest leaders and disruptors of the tea industry to inspire insightful conversation, hard hitting dialogue and fresh perspectives that will shape the future of Tea.

The convention, freshly rebranded under the timely theme Tea: A Lifestyle and A Livelihood, will shine the spotlight on Tea in all its forms, as an integral part of cultures and lifestyles across the world, and provoke meaningful dialogue and action on globally applicable, sustainable solutions to uplift diverse tea communities and tea growing environments across the world.

Tea has immense potential as a growth engine to generate sustainable outcomes for people and the planet. However, the tea industry continues to face challenging times amid the impacts of climate change, political volatility and declining socio-economic conditions across the world. About 70% of tea in the world is produced by smallholders in developing countries, catering to evolving consumer preference for exciting taste experiences that are responsibly and sustainably delivered.

The convention will cover the entire tea value chain from crop to cup with insights from producers from countries like Kenya, Sri Lanka, China and India, market perspectives from industry experts in countries like Japan, UK, GCC and U.S.A, consumer perspectives from the biggest global retailers, analysis from climate experts, innovations of leading brands, and organisations promoting social values.

The Colombo Tea Traders’ Association (CTTA) and the Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB) launched the first Colombo International Tea Convention in 1992, and this year’s event promises to be an important forum to promote fresh thinking towards ensuring the sustainability of tea and its people. This convention will be unique, with authentic Ceylon Tea experiences, and insight into the interwoven role of tea in Sri Lanka’s social and economic fabric. Delegates and accompanying family or loved ones will have the opportunity to enhance their convention experience though special packages and tours exploring Sri Lanka.
