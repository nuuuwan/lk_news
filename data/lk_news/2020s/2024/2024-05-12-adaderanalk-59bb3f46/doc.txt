Health trade unions to launch token strike at Central Province hospitals

Several health sector trade unions have decided to launch a token strike at all hospitals in the Central Province on Monday (13) over their demands.

Accordingly, the Health Trade Union Alliance stated the strike which commences tomorrow will gradually be expanded to other provinces as well.

The trade unions representing a wide range of health sector professionals – including radiology and laboratory technicians, pharmacists and drug compounders, midwives, dental surgeons, public health inspectors, and entomology officers – have engaged in strikes time and time again over the past few months demanding an allowance increase.

The trade union actions stemmed from the Cabinet Ministers’ approval of a proposal tabled by President Ranil Wickremesinghe seeking to double the DAT allowance paid to government doctors, raising it from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000.
