Gift parcels to children at 336 child development centres tomorrow

The distribution of annual gift parcels to children under the care of 336 child development centres throughout the country will be made tomorrow, the President's Media Division (PMD) said.

The gift parcels are distributed in line with President Ranil Wickremesinghe's initiative, which will take place across the island.

Coordinated by the Office of the President, with support from the Office of the Chief of Defence Staff and the Sri Lanka Army, the distribution aims to bring joy to over 10,000 children, alongside the President's New Year message.

Regardless of their circumstances, these centres across various provinces, including the Central, Eastern, Northern, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, Uva and Western, will ensure that every child feels included and valued, extending a sense of family to them.

CBL sponsors this programme facilitating the delivery of these much-awaited parcels to children nationwide.
