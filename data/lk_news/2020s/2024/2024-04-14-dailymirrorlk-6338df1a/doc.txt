Galle, April 14 (Daily Mirror) - The Sri Lanka Navy brought ashore the seized narcotics, including 179 kgs and 906 gms of Crystal Methamphetamine (ICE) and 83 kgs and 582 gms of heroin, which were seized yesterday in the seas approximately 133 nautical miles (about 246 kms) off Dondra, south of Sri Lanka.

The consignment of drugs, with an estimated street value exceeding Rs. 3,798 million, was seized during an intelligence operation conducted by the Sri Lanka Navy. A local multi-day fishing trawler, carrying six persons was intercepted during the operation.

In addition, another local one-day fishing trawler with four persons was seized, suspected to be awaiting a mid-sea exchange of narcotics.

The Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera inspected the seized consignment at the Galle Harbour.

The Sri Lanka Navy and Coast Guard remain vigilant in patrolling and conducting search operations along the island's coast to thwart illegal activities, particularly drug trafficking via sea routes.

The seized haul included Crystal Methamphetamine and heroin, concealed in 17 sacks aboard the multi-day fishing trawler. Following a thorough search at the Galle Harbour, authorities recovered 17 more sacks containing the narcotics.

The consignment, suspects and fishing trawlers were handed over to the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) for legal action.

The individuals involved in the operation, ranging in age from 23 to 54 years old are residents of areas such as Weligama, Imaduwa and Galle.

Meanwhile, the Navy said that the total street value of the drugs seized in 2024 by the Sri Lanka Navy exceeds Rs. 9,300 million.
