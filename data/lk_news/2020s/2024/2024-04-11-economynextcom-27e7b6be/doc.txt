War of words continues between Sri Lanka’s SJB, NPP on debate

ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka’s main opposition the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and the leftist NPP are on the warpath over a debate that each keeps challenging the other to but has yet to materialise.

SJB member Bandula Bandarigoda said he believes the NPP has been avoiding the matter because the party has no plan to develop the country.

“We invited the NPP first to a debate at the economic council level. Now they’re saying because it’s a presidential election, their leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake will come. Our leader gladly accepted, but this debate still hasn’t happened as they’re giving various reasons and wasting time. I think it’s because the NPP has no plan to take the country forward,” he said.

NPP member and All Ceylon Farmers Federation Convener Namal Karunaratne scoffed at the suggestion of a debate.

“What debates with the SJB? There is nothing to debate here. Who ran this country? Who is the SJB? It is the United National Party (UNP). All we can say to them is to get lost (bambu gaha ganna kiyanan),” he said.

The SJB has appointed MP Nalin Bandara to coordinate the proposed debate between the two party leaders. Bandara said in a statement the SJB would like to hold the debate sometime in May. However, a date must be first set for an preliminary debate between the two parties’ economic councils, after which a debate can be held between the two leaders.

The NPP, on the other hand, has claimed that it was in fact their leader Dissanayake that first challenged Premadasa for a debate. NPP senior Nalinda Jayatissa has reportedly said that this was as early as last year.

The party has named Jayatissa as its coordinator for the proposed debate.

The NPP is controlled by the Marxist-Leninist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). JVP general secretary Tilvin Silva said on Monday that the SJB must inform the NPP in writing of its intention to debate. (Colombo/Apr11/2024)
