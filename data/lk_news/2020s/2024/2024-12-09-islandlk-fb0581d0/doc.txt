Different scene for Manilal

Manilal Perera is well-know, both here and abroad, as a singer of repute, and a classy entertainer, as well, and he has been doing this scene for 40-plus years.

He has no plans to retire, he says, and will go on entertaining as long as he has the strength to get up on stage and do his thing. And, I’m sure this is good news for music lovers.

The ‘different scene,’ Manilal referred to, is his personal life and he quite proudly said that he has probably created history…as a Sri Lankan!

The record he has set, according to the singer, is that he has four kids, from three marriages: Two from his Italian wife (Viola, 22, and Riccardo, 19), one from his British wife (Zack, 26), and one from his German wife (Tashiya, 29).

In fact, Manilal travelled to Germany for Tashiya’s wedding, which was on 3rd October, 2024, and he had for company all of his kids, at the weddig.

He was there solely as the father of the bride and didn’t take the mic to exercise his vocal cords in order to entertain the guests. However, there was a German band in attendance, he said.

Unfortunately, none of his kids have decided to follow in the footsteps of their singing dad.

Manilal’s overseas trip took him to Italy, as well, and now he is back home…relaxing, he says.

Christmas Eve (24th) he will be seen in action at the Grand Kandyan Hotel, in Kandy.

“I’m also in talks with a five-star venue, in Colombo, regarding doing some regular dates, probably with a three-piece setup.”
