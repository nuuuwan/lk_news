IMF commends Sri Lanka’s progress in economic reforms

ECONOMYNEXT – The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said there was positive surprise on the country completing the first review under its program, during a meeting with President Ranil Wickremesinghe, yesterday (11).

Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka, Peter Breuer noted the encouraging signs regarding the program’s impact on stabilizing the economy, particularly in policy-oriented variables and fiscal areas, according to a statement by the president’s media division.

Breuer told Wickremesinghe, “With respect to revenue collection, in fact, we had a meeting that showed very encouraging numbers that basically highlight that the policies you implemented beginning from after we reached the staff level agreement in the second half of 2022 are working, that they have the intended effect, that you’re collecting the revenue that’s needed to address the cause of the crisis. So, that really is very good news.”

The upcoming formal IMF review and Article 4 consultation will focus on the new public financial management law, potential conflicts with the public-private partnership law, electricity tariffs and urgent preparations for property taxation.

The IMF pointed out the urgency of addressing fiscal matters, including amendments to the Banking Act and recapitalizing the banking sector.

Further discussions between Sri Lanka and the IMF are expected to delve deeper into these key areas among other issues. (Colombo/Jan13/2024)
