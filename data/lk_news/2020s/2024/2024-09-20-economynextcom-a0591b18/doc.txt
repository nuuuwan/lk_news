Sri Lanka ballots voted ‘X’ and a number will be rejected: Elections Commission

ECONOMYNEXT – Voters who mark an ‘X’ in front of a candidate cannot vote a second preference, Elections Commission Chairman R M A L Rathnayake said.

“A ballot paper of a person marked ‘X’ and then also place number 2 or 3 will be rejected,” he said.

Electors have to mark numbers 1 and 2 or 3 to show their preference.

A ballot paper with X and a number 1 or 2 or 3 will be rejected.

A ballot paper with number ‘1’ or ‘X’ marked for two or more candidates will be rejected.

If number 2 and 3 only is marked and number ‘1’s is not marked.

Sri Lanka voters who do not have a polling card for whatever reason can vote as long as they know the polling station they are registered and they can prove their identity. (Colombo/Aug20/2024)
