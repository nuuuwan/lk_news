Ex-President ready to disclose masterminds of Easter Sunday attacks

Former President Maithripala Sirisena claims he is aware of the true mastermind of the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks and that he is prepared to disclose the information to the judiciary if inquired from him or issues an order regarding the matter.

Commenting to the media in Kandy today (March 22), Sirisena highlighted that he is ready to disclose the relevant information and that at the same time, it is the responsibility of the judges to keep the information strictly confidential.

Speaking further he said, “I have more pain in my heart than frustration. I ran for the election as a common candidate in 2015 with the intention of elevating this country to a truly commendable position. However, I did not receive the opportunity to implement the relevant programs.”

“Neither the ruling party nor the opposition supported me. The 19th Amendment stripped away the powers vested in me, which I willingly relinquished. However, I did not anticipate that those who assume power would misuse it. Consequently, both the government and the opposition attacked me”, he added.

“Next came the Easter [attacks]. On the other hand, no one has disclosed who truly perpetrated the Easter Sunday attacks. I am aware of them. If the court requests or issues an order regarding the matter, I am prepared to reveal their identities. Additionally, it is the responsibility of the judges to maintain confidentiality in this matter”, the ex-president expressed.
