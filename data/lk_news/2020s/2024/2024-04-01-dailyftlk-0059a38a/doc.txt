Dr. Pethiyagoda to speak on ‘Cashing in on Climate’ at BALPP 6th Eminence Lecture

The 6th Eminence Lecture hosted by the Bandaranaike Academy for Leadership and Public Policy (BALLP) on 9 April at 4.30 p.m. at the BMICH is by renowned environmentalist Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda.

Dr. Pethiyagoda, whose expertise in conservation biology and natural history has garnered international acclaim. Pethiyagoda, the recipient of the Linnean Medal in 2022, which is considered the “Nobel Prize for naturalists”, brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to this discussion on the intersection of climate change and evidence-based policy making.

Dr. Pethiyagoda argues for calm, in the face of climate emergency rhetoric. He advocates that Sri Lanka should study the science and calmly evaluate policy options, putting reality ahead of rhetoric.

The Eminence Lecture series, organised by the BALPP, aims to provide a platform for distinguished speakers to share their insights and expertise on pressing local and global issues. BALPP said “Cashing in on Climate” promises to be an enlightening and thought-provoking discussion, offering attendees valuable perspectives on how climate change can be approached as an opportunity rather than a challenge.

Admission to the lecture is free, but those interested are advised to register early. (Phone: 071 231 0655 or email [email protected])
