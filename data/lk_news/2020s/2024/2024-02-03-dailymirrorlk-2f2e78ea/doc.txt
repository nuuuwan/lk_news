Sri Lanka to take on Bangladesh in all-format tour next month

(Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka will begin their all-format tour of Bangladesh next month with three T20Is, before the teams square off in ODI and Test series.

The three T20Is will provide valuable preparation for both teams as they gear up for the T20 World Cup later this year in the West Indies and United States.

After the three T20Is in Sylhet, the teams will travel to Chattogram for a three-match ODI series on March 13, 15 and 18.

This will be followed by two Test matches, the first in Sylhet and the second in Chattogram, an opportunity for both teams to resume their World Test Championship campaigns for this year.

Sri Lanka are currently last in the World Test Championship points table, having lost both Tests they have played so far in the current WTC cycle, against Pakistan last year, while Bangladesh are fourth, having split a two-match series against New Zealand.
