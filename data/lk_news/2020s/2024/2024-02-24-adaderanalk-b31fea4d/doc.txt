Rajiv Gandhi assassination case convict gets document to return to Sri Lanka

India’s Ministry of External Affairs has issued an emergency travel document for Santhan, one of the freed convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, facilitating his immediate deportation to Sri Lanka, foreign media reported.

Santhan, who is currently being held at the special camp at the Tiruchirappalli central prison, will subsequently be escorted by the officials to the Tiruchirappalli International Airport, according to The New Indian Express (TNIE).

Acting on a request from Santhan, the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commission had earlier issued a temporary travel document to him and now India’s Foreigners Registration Office (FRRO) has given an exit permit.

“Once Santhan books the ticket, he will be deported. Instructions have been given to the district administration to escort him until the airport,” District Collector & District Magistrate of Tiruchirappalli, M Pradeep Kumar was quoted as saying by TNIE.
