Sri Lanka manufacturing, services expansion slows in August 2024: PMI

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s manufacturing and service sectors continued to expand in August registering index values over 50 in August 2024, but at a slower rate compared to the previous month, according to a Purchasing Managers Index compiled by the central bank.

The Manufacturing PMI was 55.5 in August, after recording 59.5 in July, with new orders and production mainly driven by the manufacture of food and beverages.

All the sub-indices, except for employment, remained above the neutral threshold in August, the statement said. “However, Employment decreased on a month-on-month basis in August.”

The Services PMI recorded 65.2 in August after 71.1 in July. Business activities expansion was driven by improvements observed across most sectors.

“Business activities in the other personal services grew mainly due to improvements in entertainment and recreation activities,” the statement said.

“Further, business activities in the wholesale and retail trade, transportation services and financial services also indicated a considerable growth during the month.

“However, business activities in the telecommunication, real estate and IT programming consultancy related activities remained at the same level as in the previous month, while activities in all other sectors recorded improvements.”

Sri Lanka’s central bank has provided stability for the country with a stable exchange rate and largely deflationary policy by undershooting its 5 percent inflation targeting.

However printing money for 5 percent inflation and currency depreciation in the past has denied monetary stability for businesses, leading to lost confidence, as well as import controls on top of existing exchange controls. (Colombo/Sep19/2024)
