Grenade and motorcycle found as police raid Manna Ramesh’s house

The Western Province (South) Crimes Division says that a foreign-manufactured hand grenade and a motorcycle were discovered following the preliminary interrogation of the underworld criminal gang leader Ramesh Priyajanaka, also known as ‘Manna Ramesh’, who was arrested in Dubai and brought to Sri Lanka yesterday.

The grenade and the motorcycle were found hidden in the house allegedly belonging to the suspect located at Napawal, Yalagama, Avissawella.

The hand grenade was found buried inside the house while the motorcycle, suspected to have been used to carry out various crimes, was found hidden behind the house.

Police yesterday obtained a 72-hour detention order, under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), to detain ‘Manna Ramesh’ for further investigations at the Western Province (South) Crimes Division.

Meanwhile, it is reported that police are expected to obtain 90-day detention orders, under section 9/1 of the PTA, subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Ministry of Defense.
