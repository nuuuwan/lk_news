Video game leads to stabbing of an eight-year-old

A 13-year-old boy had consumed poison after stabbing an eight-year-old boy for not allowing him to play a video game on his mobile phone.

The two children are residents of Wetiya in the Angunukolapelessa police area.

The child who received stab injuries was admitted to the Kuttigala Divisional Hospital and later transferred to the Hambantota General Hospital, while the child who had consumed poison was admitted to Embilipitiya Base Hospital.

Investigations revealed that the two families had been living hand in glove, and the children welcomed visitors to each house. The two children had, however, become addicted to watching videos on their mobile phones.

On Wednesday evening (05), the 13-year-old boy visited the neighboring house when the eight-year-old boy was playing the video game. The former wanted to play a different game, but the latter had not allowed it. This had resulted in the stabbing of the eight-year-old boy.

After the incident, he had fled from the area and had consumed poison at a secret location. An individual who had noticed it had admitted the child to the Kuttigala Divisional Hospital and he was later transferred to the Embilipitiya Base Hospital.
