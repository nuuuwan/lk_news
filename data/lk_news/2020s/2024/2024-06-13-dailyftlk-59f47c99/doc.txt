Govt. to set up 25 District Industry Promotion Councils

The Cabinet of Ministers on Tuesday approved establishing 25 ‘District Industry Promotion Councils’ across the country, to address the challenges faced by locally established micro, small and medium-scale enterprises (MSMEs).

“A steering committee, comprising representatives from the public sector, private sector and other relevant institutions, will be appointed to determine the structure, role and responsibilities of these councils and to oversee the entire process,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

Acknowledging that the MSMEs are grappling with numerous issues at present, he said recognising the need for a system that is both accessible and beneficial, the Government seeks to create a supportive environment to help these industries overcome their challenges.

To achieve this, he said it is essential to establish and promote strong relationships between all relevant institutions. “The goal is to ensure that quality and efficient institutional support and services are provided at the local level through a multisectoral and integrated approach,” he added.

The proposal to this effect presented by Industries Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
