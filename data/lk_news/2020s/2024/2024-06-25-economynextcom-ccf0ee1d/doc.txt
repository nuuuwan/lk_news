Sri Lanka cabinet approves signing restructured bilateral debt deals: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet of ministers has approved the signing of restructured debt agreements with bilateral creditors, Minister Bandula Gunawardana said.

Sri Lanka has been negotiating with the Paris Club, India and China to restructure debt after declaring sovereign default in 2022 with in-principle deals reached last year.

The signing of finalized agreements called MOUs are required to re-start stalled projects and new financing.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said Sri Lanka is seeking debt relief up to 2042.

President Wickremesinghe is due to make a “special” national address on Wednesday evening, the state information office said.

Bilateral lenders give maturity extensions and coupon cuts but not hair cuts, unlike private creditors, though present values are expected to be comparable.

Sri Lanka is also expected to start talks with sovereign bond holders around Thursday, source said. (Colombo/June26/20
