Suspect arrested over shooting and killing of former cricketer

Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles says that one suspect has been arrested in connection with the murder of former captain of Sri Lanka’s Under-19 cricket team Dhammika Niroshana.

Dhammika Niroshana, also known as ‘Jonty’ was shot dead on Tuesday night (16) in front of his house at Kande Mawatha in Bogahawatte, Ambalangoda.

Niroshana was shot by an assailant who was armed with a 12-bore rifle, while he had been shot in the head killing him instantly.

Niroshana, a 41-year-old father of two, had captained the Sri Lanka Under-19 cricket team in 2002.

He had been living overseas for a period before returning to the country and was reportedly planning to travel abroad once again.
