Sri Lanka still negotiating with Melwa sale price for Hilton building

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is still negotiating the price to sell Hotel Developers Lanka Ltd, the owning company of Colombo Hilton with the company that submitted the financial bid, the State-Owned Enterprises Restructuring Unit said.

Though four parties that were pre-qualified, only one Melwa Hotels & Resorts (Pvt) Ltd, submitted an offer, the SRU said earlier in July.

Th negotiations are not yet concluded and the price has not yet been finalized.

Offers and bids are evaluated by two Cabinet appointed committees that are independent of the SOE Restructuring Unit. These are the Special Project Committee, and the Special Cabinet Appointed Negotiation Commitee (SpCANC).

“During the evaluation process, the SpCANC has the mandate to further discuss this offer with the proposer,” the SRU said at the time.

The SOERU said it acts as an implementing agency and facilitates and coordinates the work of the two committees.

This segregation of responsibilies together with other features of the Divestiture Guidelines ensures the transparency and credibility of the process the SRU said.

The hotel was sold with 4.61 acres of land leased until 2111.

For an additional price of 4.4 billion rupees, 1.875 acres of land will be allocated according to a cabinet decision made on March 21, 2022.

Two restaurants, the swimming pool, gymnasium and some of its parking was on this land. (Colombo/July26/2024)
