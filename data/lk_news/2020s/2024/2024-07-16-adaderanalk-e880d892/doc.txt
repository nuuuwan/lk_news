CTU to take legal action over govt’s one-time allowance

The General Secretary of the Ceylon Teachers’ Union (CTU) Joseph Stalin says that they intend to take legal action against the government’s decision to grant a one-time allowance to teachers who reported for duty during the recent strike.

He stressed this today (16) while speaking at a press conference held by the Teacher-Principal trade unions.

“In 1986, salary adjustments were made in this manner which led to a Supreme Court case. There it was stated that such unequal treatment could not be accepted. We will go to the Supreme Court on the basis of that decision”, said the General Secretary of the CTU.

Accordingly, he further emphasized that the government should not discriminate against others in this manner and declared that this matter would be taken to the Supreme Court.

The Cabinet of Ministers yesterday approved a proposal to pay a Rs. 10,000 one-time allowance to all government employees below Executive Grade level who reported for duty during the recent strike.

According to the proposal which was presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, approval has also been granted to award the relevant government sector employees with a certificate of appreciation.
