Nurses Union Strike Disrupts Services in Parts of Sri Lanka

COLOMBO (News 1st); The Government Nurses Union (GNU) launched a 24-hour strike today protesting what they deem an unfair disparity in allowance increases for doctors.

Union Secretary Ajith Ratnayake confirmed the strike will continue until 7 am tomorrow.

The move stems from a recent decision by the President to increase doctors' allowances by Rs. 35,000, a decision that other healthcare professionals feel unfairly excludes them.

Colombo National Hospital witnessed seemingly unchanged routines, while Gampaha District General Hospital reported normalcy in daily operations.

However, nurses at Matara General Hospital fully supported the strike, leaving patients impacted. This pattern continued in the north, with disruptions reported at both Kilinochchi District General and Vavuniya General Hospitals.

The union's primary grievance surrounds a recent allowance increase granted solely to doctors.

Ratnayake contends that such disparities are unjustifiable and detrimental to the entire healthcare system.
