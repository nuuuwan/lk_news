LAN partners SLDF to host “Creative Entrepreneurs for Social Change” competition

The Lanka Angel Network (LAN) last week partnered with the Sri Lanka Design Festival (SLDF) to bring forward the “Creative Entrepreneurs for Social Change” competition, a transformative initiative aimed at fostering social innovation within the creative sector.

The event, held at Cinnamon Life at City of Dreams, showcased how creativity can effectively address pressing societal issues.

The “Creative Entrepreneurs for Social Change” competition aimed to discover and support innovative ideas that harness creativity for social good. It received numerous inspiring applications from passionate entrepreneurs across Sri Lanka. The top finalists – Generation Alpha, AGC Innovate, White Shadow Art, and Aaythura – pitched their innovative ideas to a panel of judges of angel investors from LAN.

LAN Chairman Prajeeth Balasubramaniam kicked off the event with a few remarks, highlighting the organisation’s ongoing commitment to nurturing young entrepreneurs. “Staying true to the LAN’s vision since its inception, we have partnered with the Academy of Design (AOD) and SLDF to cultivate emerging talent and make a significant impact on the industry,” he said. “Over the past 15 years, we’ve provided mentorship and financial support to numerous startups through this competition, and we are dedicated to continuing this effort in the years to come.”

Following an evening filled with inspiring pitches, Generation Alpha Founder Miuli Kalubowila stood out to the judges with her visionary approach and unwavering commitment to driving positive change within her community.
