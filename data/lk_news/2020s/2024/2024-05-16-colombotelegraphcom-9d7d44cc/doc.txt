In his solemn message, Starmer extended his heartfelt condolences to the Tamil victims, survivors, and their families, acknowledging the enduring pain caused by the atrocities they endured. He emphasized that Mullivaikkal serves not only as a day of remembrance but also as a stark reminder of the urgent need for justice.  In his message, he also emphasised that the atrocities committed during the Sri Lankan War must not be forgotten.  He went on to say that we must honor the memory of those we have lost by ensuring that the perpetrators of the heinous international crimes against Tamils are brought to justice.

In a hard-hitting message, Starmer strongly criticized the Sri Lankan Government’s lack of meaningful action in addressing the injustices of the past, highlighting its failure to fulfil promises made to the international community regarding accountability for mass atrocity crimes suffered by the Tamil people in Sri Lanka.  He urged the British government to take a leading role in referring the perpetrators of the international crimes committed against Tamils to the International Criminal Court.

Furthermore, Starmer reiterated the importance of respecting and protecting the rights of the Tamil people, emphasizing the need for lasting peace, reconciliation, and a comprehensive political solution for the Tamil people in Sri Lanka.
