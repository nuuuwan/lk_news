Several spells of showers expected in parts of the island

The Meteorology Department says several spells of showers will occur in the Northern Province today.

It said several spells of light showers may occur in Western, Sabaragamuwa and North-western provinces and in Galle, Matara, Kandy and Nuwara-eliya districts.

Showers or thundershowers may occur at a few places in Uva and Eastern provinces during the evening or night.

The general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
