Sapugaskanda oil refinery to undergo 45-day mandatory maintenance in July

The Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery is set to undergo a scheduled 45-day shutdown in early July 2024, marking the first major maintenance since its previous turnaround in February 2021.

Issuing a statement, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) noted that this mandatory maintenance period is essential for ensuring the refinery’s compliance with international norms, guaranteeing safe and reliable operations for the next three years.

The shutdown is part of a routine process aimed at enhancing the refinery’s efficiency and longevity. Once the maintenance is complete, the refinery will undergo upgrades to align with Sri Lanka’s evolving product requirements, ensuring its continued contribution to the nation’s energy sector.

During the scheduled shutdown, the CPC will maintain a full capacity of crude oil to facilitate a swift return to full throughput once operations resume. Additionally, the CPC will maintain a buffer stock of products equivalent to approximately twice the planned shutdown period, ensuring uninterrupted supply to customers during this period.

The Sapugaskanda oil refinery plays a crucial role in meeting the country’s energy needs.
