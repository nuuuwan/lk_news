Give cup of milk tea for Rs. 80: Asela Sampath

Colombo, April 25 (Daily Mirror) - National Consumer Front Chairman Asela Sampath urged the canteen owners to provide a cup of milk tea for Rs. 80 from today while granting the concession of the reduced prices of imported milk powder to the consumers.

Addressing the media, he said the milk powder importers had decided to reduce the retail prices of their one kilogram and 400 grams of milk powder packets with effect from today due to the depreciation of the dollar in the world market.

"In the recent past, people used to avoid patronising hotels to have a cup of milk tea due to the increase in milk powder prices.

"Now the situation has changed, and again, people have the opportunity to have a cup of milk tea at a price of Rs. 80," Sampath said.
