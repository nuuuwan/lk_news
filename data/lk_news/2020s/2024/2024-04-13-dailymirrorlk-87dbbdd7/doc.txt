All presidential candidates should reveal their educational qualifications: Navin Dissanayake

All presidential candidates should show the public their apparent qualifications, whether they engage in public debates or not, former Minister Navin Dissanayake said.

"All presidential candidates, be it A/L,s degrees or masters/professional qualifications, should show their qualifications to the public. We cannot have mere talkers crashing this country after an amazing stable recovery," Dissanayake said in his latest post on X.
