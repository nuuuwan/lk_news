No agreement with Dhammika Perera on Presidential candidacy: Prasanna

Matara, Jan. 18 (Daily Mirror)- Minister Prasanna Ranatunga ruled out any agreement between Parliamentarian Dhammika Perera and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) on the Presidential candidacy.

He told reporters after the Matara District Coordination Committee meeting that they cannot put the country in trouble again by appointing an inexperienced President.

"I am an active member of the party. As far as I know, the SLPP has not entered into any agreements with Dhammika Perera on the Presidential candidacy," he said responding to a question.

He said the SLPP has not taken a decision to field a candidate for the Presidency as yet and added that the SLPP should give President Ranil Wickremesinghe another chance if he is contesting.
