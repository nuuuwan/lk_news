Sri Lanka to recruit 500 foreign language teachers

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will recruit 500 foreign language teachers for schools, State Minister of Education Aravindh Kumar, said.

“We will be giving priority to Korean, German, French, Hindi, Chinese and Japanese,” Kumar told reporters on Friday.

In March, Kumar said that teaching foreign languages such as Japanese and Korean is essential if graduates are to pursue jobs in foreign countries.

As of June 2024, Sri Lanka had sent 10,000 workers to South Korea, and is planning to send around 6,000 workers to Japan.

In order to seek employment in these countries, the candidates must pass a language proficiency test. (Colombo/Jul12/2024)
