CAA cracks down on bakery owners for underweight bread sales

Colombo, Feb 09 - (Daily Mirror) -Â  The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) has taken action against 232 bakery and shop owners for violating regulations by selling underweight loaves of bread and neglecting to display prices.

This move follows the publication of an Extraordinary Gazette on February 2, which outlined standard weights for bread products.

According to the gazette, a loaf of bread should weigh 450g with a permissible deficiency of 13.5g, while a half loaf should weigh 225g with a 9g allowance for deficiency. It explicitly stated that all bread products must adhere to these standards during manufacturing, packaging, storage and sale, whether at the retail or wholesale level.

Furthermore, the gazette mandated that traders prominently display the weight of bread offered for sale to ensure transparency and compliance with consumer protection laws.

Following the publication of the gazette, the CAA initiated extensive island-wide raids to identify vendors flouting the regulations.
