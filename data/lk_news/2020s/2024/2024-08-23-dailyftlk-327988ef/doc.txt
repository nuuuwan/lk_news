Six new companies to operate tourist counters at BIA

The Cabinet of Ministers on Wednesday approved the awarding of contracts for the operation of six tourist service counters at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake, for three years.

Speaking at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said the move follows a competitive bidding process initiated by Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd.

The selected companies include: Airport Tourist Drivers Association, Ayubowan Tours and Travels Ltd., Avawia Tours Ltd., Lanka Travel Agent Association, Casons Travels Ltd., and JNW Lanka Tours.

“A total of 12 bids were received in response to the call for tenders to operate the service counters located in the vacant lobby area in front of the arrivals terminal of BIA. After a thorough evaluation by the Technical Appraisal Committee and the Standing Procurement Committee, which were appointed by the Cabinet, the bidders who submitted the highest most responsive proposals were selected for the utilisation of the respective areas for a period of three years,” he added.

Gunawardena said the new tourist service counters are expected to offer a range of services to incoming travellers, contributing to an improved visitor experience and boosting tourism industry and economy.

The proposal to this effect submitted by Ports, Shipping and Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
