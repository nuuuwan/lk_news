CEB spokesman suggests students should study by oil lamp

Colombo, Feb 21 (Daily Mirror) - Spokesman for the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), Noel Priyantha, stirred a controversy during a recent television programme by suggesting that children should resort to studying using oil lamps if necessary, citing the precedent set by previous generations who excelled in their studies under similar conditions.

Priyantha made these remarks while addressing concerns over the escalating electricity prices in Sri Lanka.

In response to queries about the adverse effects of power disconnections due to unpaid bills, he acknowledged the hardships faced by consumers but attributed them to a shift from a culture of free electricity.

Highlighting that electricity charges had remained stagnant for nearly a decade before the recent increases, Priyantha stressed on the financial challenges faced by the CEB, which owes the government a substantial amount.

In response to the statement by the CEB spokesman, the TV presenter argued that with the advancement of technology and emergence of electronic devices, the present children can't be compared to the previous generation as things have drastically changed over the time.

Defending the decision to hike electricity prices, Priyantha questioned the necessity of electricity for studying, suggesting that traditional methods such as oil lamps would suffice.

He shared his personal experience of studying by oil lamp and implied that today's parents should prioritize providing for their children's basic needs instead of relying solely on technological advancements.
