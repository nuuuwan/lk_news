Sri Lanka President, Mannar Bishop discuss energy, land ties with India

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s President and the Bishop of Mannar have discussed ongoing negotiations on the sale of surplus renewable energy to India, and land connectivity between the two countries.

Ranil Wickremesinghe met with Rev Fidelis Lionel Emmanuel Fernando at the Mannar Bishop’s House over the weekend.

“During their discussion it was noted that negotiations are underway regarding the sale of surplus renewable energy to India,” a statement by the Wickremesinghe’s media division said.

A feasibility study is being conducted on establishing a power line connection between the two countries, with further discussions expected during the visit of the Indian Foreign Minister this week.

A pre-feasibility study for a land connection between Sri Lanka and India has been completed, and a full feasibility study will be conducted in the near future, President Wickremesinghe said.

The president and bishop “discussed future development plans for the Mannar district,” including the development of Point Pedro and Mullaitivu as renewable energy hubs. “Emphasis was placed on ensuring that these development activities are carried out in an environmentally-friendly manner.”

Plans to develop Mannar as a tourist hub were discussed, including the potential development of Mannar Fort to attract cruise tourists.

The bishop urged the president to address the issues faced by Mannar fishermen.

The meeting was attended by Vicar General of the Mannar Diocese, Father P. Christunayagam; Reverend Father Gnanpragasam of Madu Church; Father Peppi Sosei; former Vicar General of the Mannar Diocese; and other clergy members. (Colombo/Jun17/2024)
