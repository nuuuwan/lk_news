Motion filed against NPP’s registration as a political party

A motion was filed before the Supreme Court today (Feb.06) challenging the registration of the National People’s Power (NPP) by the Election Commission.

Vinivida Foundation’s secretary Attorney-at-Law Nagananda Kodituwakku has put forward the motion pertaining to a petition filed against the Election Commission’s decision to reject the registration of ‘Vinivida Foundation’ as a political party.

Kodituwakku claims that the registration of NPP, which is part of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), as a political party is completely against the law.

Pursuant to Article 103(2) of the Constitution, registering different branches of one party as separate political parties is in violation of the election laws, he alleges.

It also violates the right to free and fair elections guaranteed by the Constitution, Kodituwakku pointed out further, seeking permission from the Supreme Court to make submissions in this regard.
