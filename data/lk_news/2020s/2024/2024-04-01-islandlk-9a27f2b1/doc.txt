DIVA continues to recognise steadfast spirit of women entrepreneurs

Diva celebrated the victors of the Diva Daathata Diriyak Entrepreneurial Skills Development Programme in Galle on 28 February 2024. This initiative encompassed comprehensive training sessions centred around women’s entrepreneurship and skill enhancement. Post a thorough evaluation process, four highest performing entrepreneurs were awarded at this ceremony.

Amid the prevailing economic challenges confronting the nation, a striking trend has emerged: entrepreneurs, hailing from both small and medium-scale enterprises, have emerged as a driving force behind domestic economic growth. Their substantial contributions have played a vital role in revitalizing the nation’s economy. Particularly noteworthy is the transition of homemakers into entrepreneurs, bolstering their household economies. This transition extends beyond traditional domestic roles like sewing, knitting, and culinary arts, signalling a significant shift where women are actively propelling the national economy forward as integral members of the workforce.

Recognizing the steadfast spirit of women entrepreneurs, DIVA has launched the Diva Daathata Diriyak Entrepreneurial Skills Development programme with the primary aim of providing expert guidance to refine their business acumen, skills, and capabilities. This programme is meticulously crafted to empower women entrepreneurs by endowing them with the confidence, knowledge, and skills necessary for initiating, managing, and strategically selling their businesses.
