Harsha informed to give statement to CID over threats

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has informed SJB MP Dr. Harsha de Silva that they need to record a statement over his claims of threats against him, police said.

Public Security Minister Tiran Alles yesterday instructed IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon to direct the CID to investigate into the alleged threats received by the opposition parliamentarian.

Speaking in Parliament on Friday (7), the Chair of the Committee of Public Finance (COPF) claimed that he is faced with threats to his life over the inquiry into the controversy surrounding the new visa issuance system.

“…. I addressed intimidation & false accusations during the VFS inquiry. Despite these challenges, my dedication to transparency & accountability remains strong. We’ve accomplished much, including key financial reforms,” he posted on ‘X’ (formerly Twitter).
