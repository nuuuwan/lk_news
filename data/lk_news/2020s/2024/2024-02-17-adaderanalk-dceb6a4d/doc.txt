Sri Lanka to host 37th session of Asia Pacific Regional Conference next week

The 37th session of the Asia Pacific Regional Conference (APRC) of Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is scheduled to be held as a high-level Ministerial in-person event in Colombo from 19 - 22 February.

It was preceded by the Senior Officers Meeting (SOM) virtually held from 31 January to 02 February 2024.

The state of food and agriculture in the region; agrifood systems transformation; and solutions particularly for smallholders and family farmers are slated to be deliberated during the conference.

The inaugural session of the 37th session of APRC will be presided over by President Ranil Wickremesinghe on 20 February.

By hosting the 37th APRC, Sri Lanka demonstrates the country’s dedication to the growth of sustainable agriculture, not just at home but across the region, and showcases its commitment to being partners in sustainable agricultural development.

The APRC agenda will include a forum on agritourism, especially requested by the Sri Lankan government. This forum will give high-level delegates arriving in the island from across the Asia Pacific region the opportunity to recognize Sri Lanka’s viability as an agritourism destination, further developing the nation’s agritourism sector and bringing in valuable foreign exchange.

A delegation from the Regional Office of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) arrived in Sri Lanka in late January to oversee the organizing activities of the conference.

The APRC allows ministers of agriculture and high-ranking officials from 46 member countries across the Asia Pacific region to discuss challenges and priorities related to food and agriculture, promoting regional coherence.

This year’s APRC will draw attention on the state of food and agriculture in the region; agrifood systems transformation; and solutions particularly for smallholders and family farmers.

The regional conference is held once every two years, in years when the global FAO Conference does not meet in regular session.
