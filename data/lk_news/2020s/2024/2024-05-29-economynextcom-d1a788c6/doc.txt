Sri Lanka central bank gets IFC, World Bank help to focus on green finance

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Central Bank has entered into a cooperation agreement with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the World Bank Group, to obtain technical and financial assistance to focus on green finance.

This will help to update its Roadmap for Sustainable Finance, Green Finance Taxonomy, and also to expand the focus of the National Financial Inclusion Strategy Phase II, by including inclusive green finance with an emphasis on export-oriented SMEs, the central bank said.

The program is partially financed by the European Union’s Accelerating Climate-Smart and Inclusive Infrastructure in South Asia Program which supports sustainable private sector development. (Colombo/May29/2024)
