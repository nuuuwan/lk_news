“There was foreign appetite on John Keells Holdings Plc,” Softlogic Stockbrokers said. “This brought in 56 million, about 11 percent of the total turnover.”

John Keells Holdings Plc was the top turnover generator of the day, and closed up at 180.25.

“There was also some renewed interest in companies that had palm oil cultivation in their portfolios, because the government has indicated a lifting of the ban on palm oil cultivations.”

Watawala Plantations Plc, which released interim results, showed a slump in profits on a Q-o-Q basis, though up on a Y-o-Y basis. “This was mainly due to their exposure to palm oil and dairy, which recorded low volumes.”
