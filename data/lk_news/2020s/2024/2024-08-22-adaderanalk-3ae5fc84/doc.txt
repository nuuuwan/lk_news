‘We gain nothing by misleading Tamil people in the North’ - Namal

The Presidential Candidate of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Namal Rajapaksa asserts that police and land powers will not be devolved to the Provincial Councils under his governance.

Addressing his maiden rally in Anuradhapura, Rajapaksa stated that he believes their government was toppled by a conspiracy and that however, they did not let the state collapse.

“We handed over the government to President Ranil Wickremesinghe because it was necessary to protect the state”, Rajapaksa said.

“Although there were policies that the SLPP could not agree with, we still offered our support. We engage in politics with principles. We are a political camp that protects our values. Therefore, let’s move forward with a plan”, he added.

Speaking further, the SLPP presidential candidate said: “We are committed to respecting all religions in this Buddhist country. We will not devolve land and police powers to provincial councils. We gain nothing by misleading our Tamil people in the North.”

“We must be transparent about what we can and cannot do”, he expressed.
