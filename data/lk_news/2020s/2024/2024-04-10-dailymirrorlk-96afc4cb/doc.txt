PHI Union gripped by fear following Treasurerâ€™s death

Colombo, April 10 (Daily Mirror)- In the wake of the tragic death of Treasurer of the Public Health Inspectors' Union, Roshan Kumara Vithanage, the Public Health Inspectors are in cold sweat hindering their ability to carry out responsibilities effectively.

Roshan Kumara was shot dead at his house in Elpitiya in February leaving doubts of the motive behind his death.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, PHI union Head Upul Rohana said a significant number of PHIs feel insecure and fearful in the performance of their duties in light of the tragic incident.

Despite assurances from the Inspector General of Police that investigations have been handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and the Special Task Force (STF), Rohana lamented the lack of progress in the case thus far.

Roshan Kumara Vithanage, the deceased PHI, had been involved in handling several serious legal cases and had uncovered alarming revelations regarding establishments selling rotten food.

As fear looms large among PHIs, Upul Rohan emphasized that many inspectors are now hesitant to carry out their duties at full capacity due to concerns for their safety.
