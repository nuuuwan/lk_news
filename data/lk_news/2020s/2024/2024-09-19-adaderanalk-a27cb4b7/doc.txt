Cricket Australia bans ex-Sri Lankan cricketer Dulip Samaraweera for 20 years

Cricket Australia (CA) has banned former Sri Lankan Test player Dulip Samaraweera for 20 years after he “committed a serious breach” of the organisation’s code of conduct.

Samaraweera is banned from holding any position within CA or a state or territory association, including any WBBL or BBL teams.

CA’s conduct commission found Samaraweera engaged in “inappropriate behaviour” while he was employed by Cricket Victoria (CV).

“CA and CV are committed to providing a safe environment for all players and employees and the welfare of those subjected to mistreatment is paramount,” a CA statement read.

CV also released a statement, saying it “strongly” supported CA’s decision to ban Samaraweera, who had worked with the state women’s program.

“It is our view that the conduct was utterly reprehensible and a betrayal of everything we stand for at Cricket Victoria,” CV chief executive Nick Cummins said.

“The victim in this case has demonstrated incredible strength of character and courage in speaking up. She will continue to receive our ongoing support to allow her to achieve her goals on and off the field.”

Cummins added: “From an organisation perspective, the safety and wellbeing of everyone at Cricket Victoria is paramount.

“We will not tolerate any behaviour which compromises that position, or our people, and will always support our culture of speaking up.”

Samaraweera was appointed head coach of the Victorian women’s team in May but resigned later that month prior to commencing the role.

Samaraweera had joined CV in 2008 as a specialist batting coach.

He played seven Tests for Sri Lanka between 1993 and 1995 and appeared in five ODIs during his playing career.
