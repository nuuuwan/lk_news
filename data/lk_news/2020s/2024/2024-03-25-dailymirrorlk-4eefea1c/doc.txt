Nissan to launch 30 new models by 2027

Japan, March 25 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor (7201.T), opens new tab said on Monday it would launch 30 new models over the next three years and aim to raise its global sales by 1 million vehicles while cutting costs to improve profitability.

Nissan will explore new partnerships in the U.S. and Japan and continue to leverage its long-standing alliance with Renault (RENA.PA), opens new tab and Mitsubishi Motors (7211.T), opens new tab in Europe and other regions such as India and Latin America, it said.
