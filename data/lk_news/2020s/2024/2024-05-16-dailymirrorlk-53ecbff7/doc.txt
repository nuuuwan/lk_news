Sri Lanka plans small arms ammo factory - Premitha

Colombo, May 16 (Daily Mirror) - State Minister of Defence Premitha Bandara Tennakoon yesterday announced that Sri Lanka is in the process of establishing a small arms ammunition manufacturing unit within the country.

Speaking to reporters at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) State Minister Tennakoon said, “We are in discussion with India to set up a small arms manufacturing unit.”

“What you have to understand is the Indian defence manufacturing arm has boomed during the last two decades. It is a model that we have to look into. We can take a lot from Indian model and nothing wrong in learning from them. I think we also should get into manufacturing,” he said.

In response to a question whether Sri Lanka is going to buy military equipment from India, the Minister said, “We are not trying to buy anything at the moment.”

"Connectivity is really good and military-to-military connectivity. Indian and Sri Lankan military-to-military connectivity is at a high. So we maintain that. So that doesn't mean that we are going to buy anything from anyone," he said.
