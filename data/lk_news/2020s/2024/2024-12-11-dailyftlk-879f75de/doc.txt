Greenlect to launch SLFRS-aligned ESG Reporting Platform

Greenlect ESG Consulting Pte Ltd, an ESG consultancy headquartered in Singapore, will launch its highly customizable ESG Reporting Platform in January 2025. Designed for Sri Lankan companies preparing for mandatory ESG reporting under SLFRS S1 and S2 standards from 2025, the platform aims to simplify the compliance process by streamlining data collection and reporting.

Greenlect’s platform replaces cumbersome and error-prone spreadsheets with a centralized, user-friendly solution designed to improve accuracy and efficiency. Featuring customizable templates for ESG reporting, including SLFRS S1 and S2, the platform is also adaptable to global standards such as ISO and allows the flexibility for businesses and ESG consultancies to create tailored templates for specific reporting needs. By simplifying complex standards into clear, actionable language, it ensures compliance is accessible—even for companies without dedicated sustainability teams. Features such as tools for capturing Scope 3 emissions and supply chain data, enable businesses to achieve comprehensive and efficient sustainability reporting.

By easing the challenges of data management and regulatory alignment, Greenlect’s platform enables companies to focus on achieving their broader sustainability goals. The platform is backed by Greenlect’s experienced international ESG advisory team, offering businesses expert guidance to navigate their ESG journey with confidence and precision.
