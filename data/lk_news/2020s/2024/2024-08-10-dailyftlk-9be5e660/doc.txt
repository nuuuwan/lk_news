Ambewela delivers unmatched premium quality dairy products with its latest technology and innovation

Ambewela dairy products – manufactured by Lanka Milk Foods (CWE) PLC – is a household name synonymous with freshness and quality.

Originating from Sri Lanka’s lushest highland pastures, each Ambewela product is the result of a meticulous process that ensures the highest quality dairy delights, from farm to family. The product range, which includes fresh milk, cheese, and yoghurt, consistently offers superior value and quality, making it one of Sri Lanka’s most beloved brands.

In order to meet the most stringent modern standards, Ambewela Dairy Farms follow internationally-certified processes, where milk is rapidly cooled, stored, transported, and packed to maintain freshness. The entire process from milking to packing is swift and continuously monitored for quality. Any batch showing even minor deviations in lab results is rejected to ensure only the freshest, safest, and most nutritious products reach consumers.

The farms also employ Ultra High Temperature (UHT) processing at 140 degrees centigrade for just four seconds, preserving nutrients and avoiding the burnt taste of sterilisation. With superior packaging, the milk has a six-month shelf life at room temperature. This commitment to science-based excellence and state-of-the-art technology has established Ambewela as the pioneering ISO-certified UHT milk processing plant in Sri Lanka.

Another unique factor is that Ambewela milk is never adulterated with milk powder or any other substitutes. The milk is in its purest form and premium with high fat percentages and milk nutrients. The Friesian and Ayrshires cows at the Ambewela farms are considered the world’s best and the best pedigree siemens are picked for artificial insemination to deliver high quality milk.

Ambewela CEO highlighted the company’s strong vision saying: “From our inception, we have been committed to uplifting Sri Lanka’s dairy industry and supporting its national expansion. We understand the national requirement and aim to promote local products to reduce imports.”

Ambewela remains committed to providing premium quality, unadulterated milk the consumers and nation deserves, from farm to family.
