Sri Lanka to pilot pre-arrival processing of import shipments from May

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka Customs is seeking early declaration of cargo from this month, and will begin pre-arrival processing of import cargo as a pilot project from May, Additional Director General Sudatta Silva said.

“It is still in the development stage,” Silva told EconomyNext.  “If the pilot is successful, we would be able to launch by the end of June.”

Currently cargo ships arriving in Sri Lanka must declare the cargo upon their arrival in territorial waters.

“We plan on getting cargo information 48 hours before the departure of the ship from the foreign port,” Silva said. “That way it is faster for us to do our homework.”

“This way we can do the risk assessment and see if it’s low risk, medium risk or high risk.”

Sri Lanka Customs can then start the process of authorization and documentation before the ship arrives in Sri Lankan territorial waters.

Prior cargo declaration begins from April, and piloting of pre-arrival processing is set to start on May 1.
