BASL calls for independent probe into surge in killings by police

Colombo (News 1st) â€“ The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has called for an independent inquiry into the recent surge of fatalities involving police.

The BASL statement comes in the wake of a member of the public being shot dead in Narammala last week by a police officer in civilian clothing.

The BASL also criticised Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles, for stating that he would publish a list of persons who obstructed the ongoing Operation Yukthiya anti-narcotics program, which has drawn much criticism for its heavy-handed approach.

"It is evident that these statements, among others, made by a government minister, are irresponsibly misleading and detrimental to the crucial role lawyers play in preserving public interest," the statement said.

"The justice system provide a vital check and balance and should not be attacked for the sake of political point-scoring. We vehemently denounce the use of divisive and deceptive rhetoric that undermines the rue of law and those deicated to upholding it," the BASL said.
