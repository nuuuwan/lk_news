April 15 to be declared a public holiday?

The Cabinet of Ministers will consider whether to declare April 15 (Monday) a public holiday, given that a few of the 2024 Sinhala and Tamil New Year’s auspicious times are scheduled for April 14.

Accordingly, the matter will reportedly be discussed during today’s (April 8) Cabinet meeting.

This year, April 13 and 14 have seen several auspicious times for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, while April 15, falling on a Monday, remains a typical working day.

However, several parties have requested to declare next Monday (April 15) a public holiday, but no final decision has been arrived at, regarding the matter as of yet.

Meanwhile, State Minister of Home Affairs Ashoka Priyantha stated that a Cabinet decision is required to declare April 15 as a public holiday. Therefore, the matter will reportedly be addressed in the Cabinet meeting scheduled for this afternoon.
