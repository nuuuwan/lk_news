Sri Lanka Navy joins Australia’s military in IPE activities

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will engage in joint activities with the Australian military in the Indo-Pacific Endeavour (IPE) activities, starting off with joint work with Sri Lanka Air Force Maritime Squadron, Australia’s embassy in Colombo said.

“The first engagement of IPE 2024 will be a Law of the Sea workshop focused on maritime surveillance and involving members of the Sri Lanka Air Force Maritime Squadron,” the embassy said in a statement.

“Participants will engage in scenario-based training addressing regional security issues such as drug smuggling and illegal fishing.

“Other IPE 2024 activities in Sri Lanka include a combined diving activity that will see members of the Royal Australian Navy and Sri Lankan Navy exchange knowledge and skills.”

IPE supports the Australian Government’s focus on deepening diplomatic and defence partnerships across Southeast Asia and the Northeast Indian Ocean.

Royal Australian Navy ships, Australian Army detachments and Royal Australian Air Force aircraft will support military exercises and engagement activities, sharing information and providing training opportunities throughout IPE 2024.

“This week’s engagements will deepen our close cooperation on regional security challenges, especially in maritime surveillance to combat transnational organised crime and illegal fishing,” Commodore Michael Harris OAM, RAN, Commander IPE 2024 said.

“We look forward to building stronger defence ties, learning from one another, and deepening our close cooperation this week.”

The engagement “reinforces Australia’s commitment to a peaceful, stable and prosperous region, founded on openness, respect for sovereignty and adherence to agreed rules and norms.”

IPE 2024 will also conduct activities with Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam over the next five months. (Colombo/Aug12/2024)
