‘No one above the law’: Anura Kumara promises a safe, just Sri Lanka

The Leader of the National People’s Power (NPP) and presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake says that they will create a country where the law and order is equally applied for everyone, under their government.

Addressing a public rally in the Kolonnawa area, Dissanayake stated that the need to create a country where everyone can live in freedom has now arisen.

Furthermore, he stressed that if the people do not make that political decision, then the country and every life will always be unsafe.

“Who can give a certification about that? Someone attends the opening of a saloon and was shot dead. What is this? Do we need a country like this?”, the NPP leader questioned.

He also emphasized that the responsibility to curb such criminal activity lies on the hands of the government, adding that “we are fully prepared to take over that duty.”

“Everyone is equal before the law. No one is above the law. It will equally apply for me, you and everyone else”, Dissanayake added.
