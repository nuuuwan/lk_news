Sri Lanka central bank repays Reserve Bank of India $450mn in 2024

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank has repaid 450 million dollars to the Reserve Bank of India in the first six months of 2024, official data show.

The central bank owed the RBI, 2001.43 million dollars by June 2024.

When the numbers were first disclosed in 2023 third quarter the central bank owned the RBI 2,601.43 million dollars indicating that so far least 600 million dollars has been repaid.

The Reserve Bank of India gave Sri Lanka’s central bank a swap and also allowed the agency to run arrears on the Asian Clearing Union dues.

Swaps are used by ‘age of inflation’ soft-pegged central banks with a policy rate to delay rate hikes, worsen external imbalances and effectively re-finance private sector credit with printed money (by offsetting or sterilizing the intervention with new money), critics say.

The money from swaps or other borrowings when used by central bank to provide dollars for private sector imports, leads to liquidity injections unless rates are allowed to rise and reserve money to shrink (unsterilized interventions).

Swaps as a tool to print money and delay rate hikes was invented by the Federal Reserve in the 1960s as it operated ‘full employment’ policies eventually busting the Bretton Woods in 1971-73.

Sri Lanka’s central bank is running broadly deflationary policy and has refrained from triggering inflation, forex shortages and general monetary instability through inflationary open market operations from September 2022.

However it has created pressure on the currency by allowing a build up of liquidity from dollar purchases (unsterilized purchases) driving rates down and not intervening to redeem the rupees sufficiently on a few occasions. (Colombo/Aug08/2024)
