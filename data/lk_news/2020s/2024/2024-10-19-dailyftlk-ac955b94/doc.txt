DNA asks SC to halt Vanni elections over nomination rejection

Party is also seeking writ overturning district returning officer’s decision to reject DNA’s nomination papers

Argues rejection is illegal as DNA had duly submitted all requisite documentation

The Democratic National Alliance (DNA) led by Pararajasingham Udayarasa has filed a petition before the Supreme Court challenging the rejection of the party’s nomination papers for the upcoming General Election in the Vanni electoral district.

The petition was submitted following the District Returning Officer’s decision to reject DNA’s nomination papers.

Pararajasingham Udayarasa, the authorised officer of the DNA along with two others, filed the petition, naming the Commissioner General of the Election Commission of Sri Lanka, its members, the Vanni District Returning Officer, and several others as respondents.

The petitioners argue that the rejection of their nomination papers was unlawful, claiming that all required documents were duly submitted. They are requesting the Supreme Court to issue a writ overturning the decision of the Returning Officer.

In addition to seeking this writ, the petitioners are also requesting an interim order to postpone the election in the Vanni electoral district, scheduled for 14 November, until the case is resolved.
