O/L exam irregularities reported from Colombo and Hasalaka

The Commissioner General of Examinations, Mr. H.J.M.C. Amith Jayasundara, says that a complaint will be lodged with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) today (10) concerning irregularities detected during the ongoing G.C.E. Ordinary Level examination.

These irregularities have been reported at two examination centers in Colombo and one in the Hasalaka area. It has come to light that certain candidates had attempted to obtain answers by discreetly capturing photographs of the English question paper using mobile phones and sharing them with third parties.

The Department of Examinations has confirmed that officials present at the examination centers at the time seized the mobile phones in question.

In response to an inquiry from Ada Derana, the Commissioner General confirmed that complaints have been filed with the local police stations in the respective areas where the said examination centers are situated.
