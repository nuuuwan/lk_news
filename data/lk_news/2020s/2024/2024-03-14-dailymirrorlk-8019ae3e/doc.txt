Sri Lanka grappling with severe clove production decline

Sri Lanka is currently experiencing a severe decline in clove production, Mirror Business learns.

The experts attribute the downfall to the heavy rainfall towards the end of August last year, causing premature shedding of the clove buds. Consequently, the seasonal cultivation cycle, which was anticipated to commence between December and January, has been adversely affected.

Speaking to Mirror Business, Export Agriculture Industries Director General A.P.P. Disna shared that the country is projected to achieve only 20 percent of its annual clove production, with the export quantities likely to plummet to below 1000 tonnes.

“Cloves exhibit a cyclic pattern of abundant yields every three years. In a favourable season, we can export between 4000 and 6000 tonnes of cloves. Last year, we had good production. But this year, the overall production is roughly forecasted to be just 600-700 tonnes,” Disna revealed.

Moreover, the clove prices have surged, due to the scarcity, ranging from Rs.3450 to Rs.4000 per kilogramme as of Tuesday, the department further shared. The farmers are finding it increasingly costly, in terms of labour charges, to harvest the scarce cloves.

The industry stakeholders warn that Sri Lanka may need to wait until the next season in December to witness any significant recovery in clove production.

Cloves are mainly grown in the central hills of Sri Lanka, particularly in regions such as Kandy, Matale and Nuwara Eliya, as the areas provide the suitable climatic conditions for clove cultivation, with the necessary combination of warmth, humidity and rainfall.

In Sri Lanka, the crop is generally harvested by hand, when they reach the appropriate stage of maturity.
