Mattala airport privatization: Cabinet decision this week

Colombo, April 24 (Daily Mirror) - The Cabinet is likely to endorse a proposal this week on the transfer of the management of Sri Lanka’s second largest Mattala international airport, a top official said.

The Ports, Shipping and Aviation Ministry has already submitted the Cabinet proposal in this regard to be considered at the next sitting expected later this week.

The airport built with a Chinese loan of US $ 307 million has been running up heavy losses. The area where it's located — Mattala — is close to Hambantota, now meant to become the country's new commercial and transportation hub.

The airport is currently used for handling chartered tourist flights from Russia and some Central Asian countries.
