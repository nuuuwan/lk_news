SL in a critical moment which may bring profound impacts on business community and society: CPA Australia

We understand that Sri Lanka is undergoing a critical moment which may bring many profound impacts to the business community and society, Dale Pinto FCPA John Curtin Distinguished Professor President & Chair of the Board CPA Australia told The Island Financial Review in an email interview.

He made this comment when The Island reached out to him to ask what transformations the business and accounting landscape in Sri Lanka should undergo post-presidential election.

When asked to elaborate on his comment, he said, ” As a professional body, CPA Australia maintains its commitment to the advancement of accounting and finance professions. However, we are not in the position to comment on any political matters to ensure a thorough focus on our core mission, which is to support the professional development of members, advocate for the profession and contribute to the public interest through initiatives that help enhance the quality and integrity of financial and business information.

Accountants and finance professionals play essential roles for the efficient operation of the economy globally. They are strategic partners influencing organisational success. We are eager to collaborate with local bodies to nurture more talent to support Sri Lanka’s economy, preparing them to equip them with contemporary skills to meet economic challenges and support sustainable growth. Therefore, education to train up more talent is critical.  Equally important is a good tax system which includes simplicity, certainty, equity, neutrality and efficiency to fund services and infrastructure to support a functioning and orderly society.”

A high-level delegation from CPA Australia, including board members and representatives from international markets, recently concluded a successful visit to Sri Lanka. The delegation’s primary focus was on establishing strong relationships with local governments, professional bodies, universities, and banking institutions.

Mr. Pinto speaking to the media during the delegation’s visit to Sri Lanka said, “We’re excited to be expanding our presence in Sri Lanka. Since the launch of our local liaison office in June 2023, we’ve seen our membership flourish to nearly 500. Many of these members are now holding pivotal roles across diverse industries, showcasing the strength and influence of CPA Australia in the region.”

The delegation also recognised long-standing members during a special ceremony, acknowledging their achievements over the past 10 or 20 years.

Mr. Pinto said that he was grateful for the support of prominent employers partnering with CPA Australia to advance the accounting and finance profession in Sri Lanka.

“Their collaboration opens up exceptional opportunities for our members, enabling them to thrive and succeed in their careers on a global scale, “he said.
