Teejay Lanka & Hemas collaborate to promote menstrual hygiene in rural schools

Top fabric manufacturer Teejay Lanka PLC and leading business conglomerate Hemas Holdings have joined forces to launch a groundbreaking initiative to promote menstrual hygiene awareness and provide essential resources to underserved communities in rural Sri Lanka.

A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by the two corporate giants outlines a collaboration that will see Hemas Holdings supplying sanitary napkins to female students above 12 years in a minimum of six schools identified by Teejay for one year. The programme will be facilitated by the FEMS H.E.R. Foundation with Teejay. An abbreviation of its principal pillars of Help, Empower and Rise, the H.E.R. Foundation was set up by FEMS to create an even bigger impact and attract more like-minded organisations and people to join its initiative to end period poverty and promote awareness in Sri Lanka.

Hemas has also undertaken to conduct educational sessions for students, imparting knowledge on proper menstrual hygiene practices, the correct usage of sanitary napkins, and appropriate methods for disposing of used sanitary napkins under this programme.

Teejay Lanka’s role will encompass creating a conducive environment for female hygiene awareness programmes in selected rural schools, sharing the necessary project-related information and student counts with Hemas before project commencement, and securing space for Hemas in girls’ washrooms at selected schools to educate students on menstrual hygiene, sanitary napkin usage, and disposal methods.

The MoU was signed by Teejay Lanka Group CEO Pubudu De Silva, and the Managing Director – Hemas Consumer Brands Ms Sabrina Esufally.
