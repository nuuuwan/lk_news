Parliament, June 6 (Daily Mirror) - The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) will submit its proposal on electricity tariff revision to the Public Utility Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) tomorrow or on Monday, and the tariff revision will be effective from July 1, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara said today.

He told Parliament that the CEB has proposed to reduce the electricity tariff for the category between 0 and 30 units by Rs. 2 from Rs. 8 to Rs. 6 per unit, and for the category between 30 and 60 units by Rs. 11 from Rs. 20 to Rs. 9.

He said the category between 60 and 90 units will be reduced from Rs. 30 to Rs. 18, while 90 and 120 units will be reduced from Rs. 50 to Rs. 30.

The Minister said if the PUCSL proposed that electricity consumers must be given more relief on tariffs, the CEB is ready to consider it.
