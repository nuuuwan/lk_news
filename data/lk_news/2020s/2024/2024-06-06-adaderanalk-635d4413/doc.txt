Postponing of 2023 LG polls: SC concludes hearing of petitions, verdict deferred

The Supreme Court, which concluded the hearing of the Fundamental Rights (FR) petitions filed against the postponement of the 2023 Local Government elections, has deferred delivering its verdict.

The relevant FR petitions filed against the postponement of the 2023 Local Government elections, which was initially scheduled to be held on March 09, 2023, were taken up before a five-member Supreme Court judge bench led by Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya today (06).

The judge bench, which concluded the hearing of the petitions following the completion of the submission of oral submissions, deferred the delivering of the verdict, Ada Derana reporter said.

The relevant petitions have been filed by several groups including the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA), and Peopleâ€™s Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL), seeking an order declaring that the fundamental human rights of the people have been violated by the failure to hold the 2023 LG elections, as previously scheduled.
