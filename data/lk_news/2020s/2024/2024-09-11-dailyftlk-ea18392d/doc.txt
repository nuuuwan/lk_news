Interpol, CID, and UAE Embassy team up to extradite Sri Lankan criminals

Following a robust and intensified collaboration between Interpol, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of Sri Lanka, and the Embassy of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in Colombo, a large number of Sri Lankan criminals from Dubai have been apprehended and extradited.

Through coordinated operations, numerous high-profile offenders, including underworld criminals and drug traffickers, have been apprehended and extradited back to Sri Lanka this year. This strengthened alliance underscores the effective synergy between international and local agencies in combating transnational crime, ensuring that the UAE remains a secure environment free from criminals.

During a meeting with UAE Ambassador in Sri Lanka Khaled Nasser Al Ameri with Public Security Secretary Viyani Gunathilaka and Head of International Cooperation and CID DIG Rohan Premaratne, they acknowledged and appreciated the consistent assistance provided by both Interpol in Abu Dhabi and the UAE Embassy in Colombo in apprehending Sri Lankan criminals and facilitating their return to Sri Lanka. The meeting was held at the UAE Embassy in Colombo.

During the meeting, Ambassador Al Ameri reaffirmed the UAEâ€™s commitment to continue supporting these initiatives.
