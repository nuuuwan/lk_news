Sri Lanka tourists to get 60-day visa free entry to Thailand

ECONOMYNEXT – Tourists from Sri Lanka would get visa free entry to Thailand from June 1 under a program approved by the country’s cabinet to boost the sector, a media report said.

Sri Lankans are among 36 countries added to a list of 57 countries that would get 60 day stays under the scheme, The Bangkok Post reported.

The new countries eligible for ‘Destination Thailand Visa’ include Albania, Cambodia, China, India, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Laos, Mexico, Morocco, Panama, Romania and Uzbekistan.

Visitors who want to work and visit tourist destinations will be able to get five-year visas valid for 180 days, extendable for another 180 days, the government spokesman Chai Wacharonke  was quoted in the news report.

The visa will allow foreign students of higher education to stay for one year after graduation and work, instead of having to leave the country immediately after finishing their course.

“They can find work during the extended period, especially in the fields that we need,” the spokesman said.

Visitors over 50 years who want long-stay visas currently need to have health insurance coverage worth 3 million baht. This has now been reduced to 440,000 baht (400,000 for inpatient treatment and 40,000 for outpatient cover).

The cabinet also approved the expansion of e-visa application services at Thai consulates and embassies from 47 to 94 locations, commencing in September. (Colombo/May30/2024)
