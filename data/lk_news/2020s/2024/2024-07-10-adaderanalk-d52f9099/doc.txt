Railway strike to continue despite dept’s warning

Sri Lanka Railway Station Masters’ Union says that their trade union action will continue further.

The General Manager of Sri Lanka Railways had warned that all Station Masters and Railway Controllers who fail to report to duty by 12.00 noon today will be considered as having vacated their positions.

Accordingly, all the striking Railway Station Masters and Railway Controllers were instructed to report for duty at their respective railway stations or at least to the nearest railway station.

The Sri Lanka Railways Station Masters’ Union had decided to launch a strike action from midnight yesterday (09) based on several demands including promotions.

As a result, several trains including the office trains and night mail trains to and from Colombo Fort and Badulla, to and from Trincomalee, to and from Batticaloa and night mail train to Rambukkana were cancelled, the department said.
