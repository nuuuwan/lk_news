Cabinet nod to amend Penal Code to strengthen legal provisions to prohibit sexual harassment

The Cabinet of Ministers at its meeting approved the proposal to publish the draft Bill criminalising all forms of sexual harassment in the Government Gazette and subsequently present it to Parliament for approval.

On 12 December 2022, the Cabinet initially approved the introduction of amendments to the Penal Code aimed at criminalising all forms of sexual harassment, including incidents occurring in public places.

“The Legal Draftsman prepared the relevant draft Bill, which has now received clearance from the Attorney General,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

He said the amendments are designed to ensure comprehensive protection for individuals and address the growing concerns over sexual harassment in various settings. “It is expected to enhance the legal framework, offering better protection for victims and deterring potential offenders, thereby contributing to a safer and more respectful society,” he added.

The proposal, presented by the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe received Cabinet approval, marking a significant step towards strengthening legal measures against sexual harassments.
