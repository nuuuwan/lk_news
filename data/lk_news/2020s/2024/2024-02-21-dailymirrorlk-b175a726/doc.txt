Electricity tariff to be reduced in greater margin than earlier proposed: Minister

The government had decided to reduce the electricity tariff in a greater margin than proposed in the earlier proposal and that the amended proposal would be submitted to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) shortly, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara said yesterday.

He told parliament that the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) had included expenditure in the proposal to complete the maintenance work which was due for the last four years within this financial year.

The Minister said the government instructed the CEB not to include the said expenditure for the current financial year and allocate the funds for the maintenance within the next three years.

He said the CEB was drafting a new proposal on electricity tariff after considering the various proposals made during the public hearing of the PUCSL and proposals made by various parties including engineers at universities on tariff revision to the CEB.

The Minister said the CEB was expected to complete its amendments to the proposals by Wednesday or Thursday this week and that the amended proposals would be handed over to the PUCSL which will make a final decision on the tariff revision.
