Facial, fingerprint recognition systems to identify passengers at BIA within next two weeks

Colombo, Jan 18 (Daily Mirror) - New facial and fingerprint recognition systems are to be introduced at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in the next two weeks to identify passengers passing through the airport, Controller General of Immigration and Emigration I.S.H.J. Ilukpitiya said.

He said the facial recognition system has already been introduced at the airport with the support of the police.

The fingerprints and images of all passengers will be collected through the system.

Accordingly, within the next month, all passengers will be identified by scanning their fingerprints and through the facial recognition system, he said.

The new programme will make it easy for passengers to be released from the airport following clear identification.
