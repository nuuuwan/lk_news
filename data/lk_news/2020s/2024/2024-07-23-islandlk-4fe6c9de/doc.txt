HSBC awarded Best International Bank in Sri Lanka by Euromoney

The award recognises HSBC’s commitment to digitization and providing competitive financial services by delivering exceptional financial results in 2023. This has further highlighted key achievements in areas such as Wholesale Banking, Sustainable Finance and the Bank’s strategic sustainability efforts in environmental conservation and women empowerment. In Asia, HSBC was bestowed with 18 awards, including Asia’s Best Bank, Asia’s Best Bank for Transaction Services, Asia’s Best Bank for Sustainable Finance and Best International Bank in Australia, China, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, The Philippines, and Vietnam.

Mark Surgenor, CEO of HSBC Sri Lanka and Maldives commented, “We are proud to receive this distinguished award from Euromoney, that is very timely and comes in the wake of a key milestone we crossed this year: the 30th anniversary in credit cards in Sri Lanka. The recognition is a testament to the hard work, dedication, and innovative spirit of the HSBC team in Sri Lanka. We remain committed to opening up a world of opportunity for our customers and clients, colleagues, and the communities we serve as we have done since 1892.”

Earlier this year, HSBC Sri Lanka was also recognised as the Best International Bank in Sri Lanka for 2024, by Finance Asia, for the seventh time, citing HSBC’s strong performance last year as it furthered its ambition across its diversified operations in the country to digitize at scale, energise for growth and transition to net zero.
