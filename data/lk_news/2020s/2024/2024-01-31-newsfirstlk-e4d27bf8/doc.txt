COLOMBO (News 1st); The Hambantota International Port (HIP) witnessed a phenomenal year in 2023, with oil and gas vessel calls skyrocketing 132% compared to 2022.

The figures achieved were amidst several challenges Tissa Wickremasinghe remarked, “We are moving forward amidst an economic downturn and a dollar

crisis in Sri Lanka, continuing to provide services without interruptions. The Palestine and Ukraine wars have also impacted the oil market contributing to a surge in global prices. We have achieved our target volumes, in spite of these crises. With major projects and developments in infrastructure occurring simultaneously, the port manages vessel operations, handles manpower efficiently, and we have achieved all of this within a completely accident-free environment.”
