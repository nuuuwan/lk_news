The High Commission of Sri Lanka in Singapore has revealed that over 400 Sri Lankan nurses currently work in Singapore.

A group of 100 nurses arrived at the Changi Airport in Singapore on Friday (15 March), under an ongoing collaboration with Singapore’s Ministry of Health Holdings, making this the largest group of nurses to be deployed to Singapore simultaneously.

Under the ongoing collaboration, nurses from Sri Lanka get the opportunity to serve within the Singapore healthcare system for a period of two years.

The Singaporean Government also provides air tickets for both ways and accommodation free of charge. Apart from the wages a one-time relocation allowance of SGD 1,000/- is given to each person.

Issuing a statement on the matter, the High Commission said, “This comprehensive support package is expected to ensure the well-being and success of foreign healthcare professionals”, adding that so far, over 420 nurses have been sent to Singapore under this programme.

The project has been initiated by the High Commission of Sri Lanka in Singapore in collaboration with the Ministry of Labour and Foreign Employment and the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE).
