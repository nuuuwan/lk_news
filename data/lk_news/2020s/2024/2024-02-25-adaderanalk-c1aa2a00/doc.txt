Jampettah Street shooting: Victim identified as close associate of ‘Pukudu Kanna’

Sri Lanka Police says the 55-year-old who was injured in the shooting incident at Jampettah Street in Colombo earlier today (25 Feb.) is suspected to be a close associate of the notorious underworld figure known by the alias ‘Pukudu Kanna’.

The shooting victim has been identified as Mohommed Rilwan, a resident of the ‘Methsanda Sewana’ housing scheme in Henamulla, police reported.

Police suspect that the shooting had been carried out as a result of a dispute between ‘Pukudu Kanna’ and rival gang member ‘Rimoshan’, the son of ‘Kudu Selvi’.

According to police, CCTV footage had shown two suspects arriving on a motorcycle near a meat shop in Jampettah Street at around 01:45 p.m. today, and they had subsequently opened fire at the 55-year-old victim.

Mohommed Rilwan was subsequently rushed to the Colombo National Hospital, and is currently receiving medical treatment, police stated.
