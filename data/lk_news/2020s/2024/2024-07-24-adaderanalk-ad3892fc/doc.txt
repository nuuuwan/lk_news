‘Red’ alert issued over strong winds and rough seas

The Department of Meteorology has issued a ‘Red’ colour advisory for strong winds and rough seas for naval and multi-day fishermen communities in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal.

As per the warning, very strong winds of about 70-80 kmph, and very rough seas are likely over the Arabian Sea area (in sea areas bounded by 10N - 23N and 55E – 72E) and Bay of Bengal (in sea areas bounded by 13N - 21N and 87E – 93E) due to the active south-west monsoonal condition.

Thus, the naval and fishing communities are advised not to venture into the sea areas marked by ‘RED’ colour on the map below, until further notice.

Those who are out at aforementioned sea regions are advised to return to coasts or move to safer areas immediately.

Naval and fishing communities are also requested to be attentive to future forecasts issued by the Department of Meteorology in this regard.
