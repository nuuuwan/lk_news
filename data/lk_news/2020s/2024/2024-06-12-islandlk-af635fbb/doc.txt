Tomato Face Pack for Blemishes

Hi! This week, I’ve decided to do the Beauty Tips scene with tomatoes.

You will need 02 tablespoons tomato pulp and 01 teaspoon honey.

After mixing the tomato and honey, apply the mixture on your face and leave it for 15 minutes or until it dries. Rinse with lukewarm water.

You will need 01 teaspoon of tomato pulp and 03-04 drops of lemon juice

Mix the lemon juice and tomato pulp and apply this pack to the affected areas of your face (blemishes).

Let it dry for 10-12 minutes before rinsing with lukewarm water.

(Repeat this once or twice daily. By the way, use lemon juice sparingly as it can cause a burning sensation when used in excess.)

You will need 1/2 cup of mashed tomato and 1/4 cup of grated cucumber.

Apply this mixture to your face, wait for 20 minutes and then wash with lukewarm water.

You will need 1/2 tomato (mashed), 01 teaspoon of coconut oil, and 01 tablespoon of yoghurt.

Apply this paste to your face and leave it on for 15 minutes and then wash it off.

You will need 02 tablespoons of tomato pulp and 02 tablespoons of papaya pulp.

Mix the papaya and tomato pulp to form a thick paste and apply this paste to your face.

You will need ½ tomato (mashed), 02 tablespoons of sandalwood powder, and a pinch of turmeric

Mix all the ingredients well in a bowl, and then apply this mixture evenly on the face.

Leave it on for about 15 minutes and then rinse with warm water.
