Urges British Govt. to take leading role in referring perpetrators of international crimes against Tamils to ICC and delivering justice to victims

UK Labour Party Leader Keir Starmer issued a statement over the weekend in which he strongly criticised the Sri Lankan Government for its lack of meaningful action in addressing past injustices.

He highlighted the Government’s failure to fulfil promises made to the international community regarding accountability for the “mass atrocity crimes suffered by the Tamil people in Sri Lanka.”

Issuing the statement through Labour MP Anneliese Dodds attending the Mullivaikkal Remembrance Day event organised by Tamils for Labour in the House of Commons Starmer said he honoured the memory of tens of thousands of Tamil people who lost their lives and suffered egregious international crimes during the final stages of the Sri Lankan war.

Accordingly, he urged the British Government to take a leading role in referring the perpetrators of the international crimes committed against Tamils to the International Criminal Court.  Starmer extended his heartfelt condolences to the Tamil victims, survivors, and their families, acknowledging the enduring pain caused by the atrocities they endured during the three-decade-long conflict.

He emphasised that Mullivaikkal serves not only as a day of remembrance but also as a stark reminder of the urgent need for justice. In his message, he also emphasised that the atrocities committed during the Sri Lankan war must not be forgotten. He went on to say that the memory of those who were lost must be honoured by ensuring that the perpetrators of the heinous international crimes against Tamils are brought to justice.  Furthermore, Starmer reiterated the importance of respecting and protecting the rights of the Tamil people, emphasising the need for lasting peace, reconciliation, and a comprehensive political solution for the Tamil people in Sri Lanka.
