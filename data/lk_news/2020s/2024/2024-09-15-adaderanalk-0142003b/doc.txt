Namal promises long-term political vision over short-term gains

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) presidential candidate, Namal Rajapaksa pledged a long-term political commitment, emphasizing his vision for shaping a better future for the next generation, rather than focusing on a conventional five-year term.

Addressing a public rally in Wellawaya yesterday (14), Rajapaksa criticized the current political discourse, highlighting that many candidates who once dismissed key development projects initiated by his father, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, are now championing them.

“Back in 2015, projects like the expressway, Port City, Hambantota International Port, and the airport were labeled ‘white elephants’. Today, those same critics are eager to build on this progress,” he said.

Furthermore, Rajapaksa outlined his focus on the agricultural sector, underscoring the importance of maximizing the use of cultivable land and supporting farmers with fertilizer subsidies.

“We are not here for quick fixes or short-term gains. Some leaders have been accustomed to selling national assets and increasing taxes just to sustain their five-year tenure. We do not believe in ending our political journey in such a short span,” he added.

Meanwhile, Rajapaksa promised to steer Sri Lanka towards becoming the most developed country in Asia, driven by a clear, actionable plan that prioritizes the welfare and future of the nation’s children.
