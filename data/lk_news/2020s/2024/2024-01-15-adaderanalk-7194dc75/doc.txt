Exam centre chief’s peon arrested over 2023 A/L exam paper leak

The Criminal Investigations Department (CID) has arrested another individual on suspicion of being involved in the incident of several questions of the 2023 G.C.E. Advanced Level examination’s Agricultural Science I & II question papers allegedly being leaked prior to the exam.

The 38-year-old male suspect had served as the peon of the exam centre chief at the A/L examination centre established at the Moratuwa Maha Vidyalaya, Police Media Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa said.

On Sunday (14), the A/L Agricultural Science teacher of a popular government school in Ampara was arrested by the CID in relation to the same incident. The police also found the 2023 G.C.E Advanced Level examination’s Agricultural Science I & II question papers written in his own handwriting at his house.

The 52-year-old male teacher reportedly also conducts tuition classes for A/L students, according to police.

He was ordered to be remanded in custody until 26 January 2024, after he was produced before the Ampara Magistrate’s Court.

On Friday (Jan. 12), the Department of Examinations decided to cancel the 2023 G.C.E. Advanced Level examination’s Agricultural Science I & II question papers, due to reports that several questions of the paper had been leaked prior to the exam.

Accordingly, the relevant test paper, which students sat for on 10 January, had been deemed invalid by the Department of Examinations on account of numerous questions included in the paper having been leaked before the exam date.

The Department of Examinations announced that the date for the rescheduled paper would be notified later.
