COLOMBO (News 1st): Sri Lanka Police has awarded Rs. 1.5 Million to the family of deceased police constable Anuradha Jayakodi, who tragically died while serving as the bodyguard of State Minister Sanath Nishantha.

The Police Media Division confirmed that the financial assistance was presented by Acting Inspector General of Police Deshbandu Tennakoon.

Further honoring Jayakodi's service, the late constable was posthumously promoted to the rank of sergeant yesterday (26).

Jayakodi, a father of one, was only 43 years old at the time of his passing.

Joining the police service in 2007, Jayakodi distinguished himself by serving in the VIP security service for the past five years, and served for the late Sanath Nishantha.
