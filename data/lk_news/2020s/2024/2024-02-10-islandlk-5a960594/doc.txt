HNB Assurance celebrates record-breaking 203 MDRT Qualifiers, including 20 COTs and 05 TOTs

The HNB Assurance last week announced a record-breaking 203 Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT) qualifiers, during the year 2023. Amongst them were, 20 sales officers who earned the status of Court of the Table (COT), while another five achieved the highly prestigious Top of the Table (TOT) status.

MDRT, the Premier Association of Financial Professionals, which was formed in 1927 is an independent association with a global count of over 72,000 professionals affiliated to insurance and financial services in over 500 companies. Crossing the 200 MDRT qualifier mark for the first time in the company’s history, HNB Assurance has consistently demonstrated a commitment to excellence and this achievement is a testament to the company’s vision of maintaining exceptional customer service and expertise.

CEO of HNB Assurance, Lasitha Wimalaratne, said: “We are immensely proud of our 203 MDRT qualifiers, including 20 individuals reaching the Court of the Table and 5 achieving Top of the Table status. This remarkable accomplishment reflects the dedication and professionalism of our team. At HNB Assurance, we are committed to excellence and continuous improvement, ensuring that our clients receive the highest level of service and expertise. In addition to this latest achievement, we were also recognized as one of the MDRT Top 100 Global Companies last year. An accolade which further underscores our commitment to maintaining global standards within the insurance industry. My congratulations to the Distribution Management, Partnership Channel and the Sales Training and Development team for meticulously crafting a comprehensive strategy that paved the way for this remarkable achievement.”

Shiran Fernando, Head of Sales Training and Development, said, “As a company we believe in investing in our team to equip them with the skills and knowledge needed to excel in the dynamic field of insurance. This achievement of 203 MDRT qualifiers, showcases the high standards we set for ourselves and the exceptional capabilities of our team. While we remain focused on providing innovative insurance solutions and maintaining the highest standards of professionalism in the industry, I must admit that this is a result of our collective efforts where both the Advisor Distribution Channel and the Partnerships channel worked closed with the T&D teams to ensure we were strategically aligned and well-equipped to achieve such a significant milestone.”
