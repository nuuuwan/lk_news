Sri Lanka to end emission testing duopoly

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will invite new companies to set up emission testing services ending a duopoly that now exists, Trade Minister Nalin Fernando said.

At the moment Laugfs Eco Sri Limited and CleanCo Lanka Limited offer vehicle emission testing in Sri Lanka.

“Considering the number of vehicles in Sri Lanka, complaints we have received from the public, and that the desired emissions reduction has not happened, we have proposed to call for bids, or expressions of interest from other vendors,” Fernando said in Parliament on Thursday.

State organizations like the Sri Lanka Transport Board can also do emission testing, the Minister said. (Colombo/May9/2024)
