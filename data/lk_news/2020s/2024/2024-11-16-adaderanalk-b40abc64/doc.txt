New govt’s policy statement to be presented at Parliament’s inaugural session

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake will present the government’s policy statement at the inaugural session of the 10th Parliament on November 21 at 3.00 p.m., the Parliamentary Communications Department announced.

This significant address, delivered at the commencement of each new parliamentary session, serves as a comprehensive presentation of the government’s vision and strategic direction. The President, as per constitutional powers, presides over the opening meetings of Parliament and sets the tone for legislative priorities through this statement.

Historically referred to as the “Rajasana Speech”, this tradition not only marks the beginning of a parliamentary session but also offers the President an opportunity to detail the administration’s priorities and plans to both Parliament and the public.
