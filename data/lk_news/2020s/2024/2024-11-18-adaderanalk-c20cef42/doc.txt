Court yet to receive Govt. Analyst’s report on Senasinghe’s luxury vehicle

The Fort Magistrate Thanuja Lakmali has ordered the issuance of a letter of reminder to the Government Analyst’s Department as the court had not received the analyst’s report regarding former MP Sujeewa Senasinghe’s luxury vehicle, worth around Rs. 100 million, which is suspected to have been illegally assembled.

President’s Counsel Maithri Gunaratne, representing Sujeewa Senasinghe, stated that although the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) had previously informed the court that a case was being heard in the Chettikulam Court regarding the vehicle, the case in question has already been concluded.

Accordingly, he therefore requested that the vehicle in question which is currently in the custody of the CID, be released to Sujeewa Senasinghe.

After considering the facts presented, the Fort Magistrate ordered the case to be recalled on November 25 as the Government Analyst’s report has still not been received by the court.

On November 11, the Fort Magistrate’s Court had ordered the CID to take former MP Sujeewa Senasinghe’s vehicle into custody and produce it to the Government Analyst’s Department and obtain a report.
