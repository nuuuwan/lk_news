‘Red’ alert issued over strong winds and rough seas due to cyclonic storm

The Department of Meteorology has issued an advisory for strong winds and rough seas for naval and fishermen communities in the deep-sea areas in the South-eastern Arabian Sea and in the Bay of Bengal.

The ‘red’ alert states that the cyclonic storm, named “Remal” (pronounced “Re-Mal”) over the North Bay of Bengal, intensified into a severe cyclone storm at 05.30 a.m. on May 26.

It is located near 19.5°N and 89.3°E, to the north-east of Sri Lanka, and 1500 km away from Kankasanthurai and it is very likely to move nearly northwards, intensify further, and cross Bangladesh and adjoining West Bengal (India) coasts by May 26th at midnight, the advisory said.

Accordingly, very strong winds 60-70 kmph, accompanied with heavy rainfalls and very rough seas are likely over the sea areas around the country and over the South-eastern Arabian Sea areas and Bay of Bengal Sea areas, it added.

Thus, the naval and fishing communities are advised not to venture into the sea areas marked by ‘RED’ color on the map below until further notice.

Those who are out at aforementioned sea regions are advised to return to coasts or moved safer areas immediately.

Naval and fishing communities are also requested to be attentive to future forecasts issued by the Department of Meteorology in this regard.
