Cabinet approval for mini hydro project turned down

Colombo, March 02 (Daily Mirror) - The Cabinet approval granted on a decision taken by the President and the Prime Minister for a mini hydro project fed by the Samanalawewa tank was turned down by Ratnapura District Coordinating Committee that met on Thursday (29).

The coordinating committee met under the chairmanship of District Parliamentarian Akila Ellawala at the District Secretariat auditorium.

The representative of the Ceylon Electricity Board told the committee that two hydropower projects in the low-lying area of Samanalawewa tank were already in operation and that the proposed project could be detrimental to the dam.

He pointed out that it was for the first time in 18 years that the tank spilt over this year and that the proposed project is to depend on the spill water canal.

He said if the project was implemented it would result in serious consequences. He pointed out the Pumbhinnna - Rajawaka road would undergo erosion and that several low lying areas including Kalthota and Medawatta would face serious environmental issues. He said the project had not received the approval of the Central Environmental Authority and the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau.

Representatives of the Building and Research Organisation and the Central Environmental Authority said they would not grant approval for the proposed mini-hydro power project.

The Ratnapura District Coordinating Committee decided to inform the President and the cabinet its decision not to approve the proposed project.
