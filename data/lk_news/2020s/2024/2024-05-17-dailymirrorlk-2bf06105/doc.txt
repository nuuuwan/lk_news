21 sailors including Sri Lankan trapped on Baltimore ship for 7 weeks

May 17 - Twenty-one sailors, 20 from India and one from Sri Lanka, are stuck on board the Dali, a container vessel that collided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, since March 26 due to the ongoing investigation.

For the last seven weeks, they have been confined to the vessel due to an ongoing probe. With their phones confiscated, they cannot even pay bills for their families back home.

The 21 on board were left without communication for weeks with their families, causing significant hardship for crew members with young children at home, and the outside world, as their mobile phones had been confiscated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as a part of the investigation into the crash.
