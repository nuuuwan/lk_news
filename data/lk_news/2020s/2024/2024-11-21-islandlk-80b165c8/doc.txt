Elevating its digital presence to new heights, National Development Bank PLC (NDB) has been recognised with the YouTube Silver Creator Award, marking an unprecedented achievement as the first Sri Lankan bank to this milestone, highlighting NDB’s dedication to leveraging digital platforms to connect with its audience and also demonstrating the bank’s effort in fostering a digitally engaged community.

The YouTube Silver Creator Award is a testament to a channel’s ability to engage audiences, build communities, and provide high-quality content, but it’s no easy feat to earn. YouTube’s stringent review process ensures that channels meet strict eligibility requirements. Apart from reaching 100,000 subscribers, this includes content quality, authenticity of subscribers, adherence to community guidelines, and originality. For NDB, being recognised as a recipient of this award reflects its compliance with these rigorous standards and its commitment to responsible, transparent digital engagement.
