Dudley’s latest $ 8.9 m tourism venture receives BOI approval

The Board of Investment (BOI) has granted approval for the latest tourism initiative from the Araliya group, led by prominent businessman Dudley Sirisena this week.

Sirisena took to Facebook to announce that his company is set to expand its leisure and tourism portfolio with the addition of the ‘Araliya Golden Beach Resort’ in Unawatuna, Galle.

This week, an agreement between the Board of Investment (BOI) and the Araliya Group was formalised at the BOI. BOI Chairman Dinesh Weerakkody represented the BOI, and Dudley Sirisena signed the documents on behalf of the Araliya Group. Sirisena said the total investment is estimated at $ 8.9 million.

Sirisena underscored his commitment to bolstering Sri Lanka’s economic growth through an increased focus on the tourism sector. According to him, the primary objective is to facilitate this by not only launching the ‘Araliya Golden Beach Resort’ but also by fostering the creation of new direct and indirect employment opportunities for youth within the country.

The group already owns another luxury hotel in the area, the Araliya Beach Resort and Spa.
