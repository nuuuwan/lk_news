Price of local eggs increased by Rs. 3

Colombo, Jan 24 (Daily Mirror) - The All Ceylon Egg Producers' Association (ACEPA) has decided to increase the price of a locally produces egg by Rs. 3 after the increase in the standard value-added tax (VAT) rate from 15% to 18% from January 1.

With the increase in the VAT, the price of an egg imported from India had been increased by Rs. 8. As a result, the price of a locally produced egg too was increased by Rs. 3.

Accordingly, the stock price of an egg directly from the poultry farm has been increased to Rs. 48. However, after the meeting held on January 21, the price increment will be effective from that day.

Accordingly, the retail price of an egg will be Rs. 54.55, the association president said.
