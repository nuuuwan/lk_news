Expressed opposition to entrepreneurship and employment fairs being conducted by Labour and Foreign Employment Ministry

Says they are being used as election propaganda events and lacks any transparency

Notes development activities are being carried out across the country in a way that promotes regional political party leaders aligned with Govt. in preparation for the upcoming elections

The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) submitted three letters to the Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL) Chairperson R.M.A.L Rathnayake yesterday raising concerns on the illegal misuse of State resources by the Government for election campaign purposes.  In a letter, the SJB alleged that the police have become politicised and noted that meetings involving members of Community Policing Committees and presented as workshops being presided over by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, are continuing and are being used as a propaganda tactics. The SJB said it has learned of additional workshops of this nature being planned in Nuwara Eliya, Ratnapura, Kegalle, and Galle in the coming days.  The party urged the ECSL to take action against these programs, which are being conducted using the resources of the Sri Lanka Police and its officers, as they violate Articles 104 (b), (e), and (i) of the Constitution.

“The police are entirely entrusted with enforcing election laws. As the police become increasingly politicised, it threatens the possibility of holding a free and fair election. Therefore, it is crucial to use all constitutional provisions to ensure the police’s independence,” the party said.

Meanwhile the SJB also expressed its opposition to various entrepreneurship and employment fairs being conducted by the Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment.  The party noted that representatives have informed them of numerous irregularities being reported about these programs, held district-wise under various titles such as Global Fair, Smart Youth, and Garusaru.

The party stated that beneficiaries of these programs are being selected without transparency, with some, chosen based on their party affiliation rather than their qualifications. The SJB also claimed that large groups of people are being assembled for propaganda purposes, and each event is being organised using public funds. “At every program attendees are being given food and cash rewards which can be considered as an election bribe,” it noted, urging the ECSL to take necessary action.

The party noted that development activities are being carried out across the country in a way that promotes regional political party leaders aligned with the Government, in preparation for the upcoming elections.

The party highlighted that using public funds for such propaganda activities constitutes an election violation. They called on the ECSL to inform the public that these projects are funded by taxpayer money and to ensure that no bias is formed towards any politician or political party based on these programs. The SJB also urged the ECSL to prevent these programs from being conducted in a manner similar to election propaganda events.
