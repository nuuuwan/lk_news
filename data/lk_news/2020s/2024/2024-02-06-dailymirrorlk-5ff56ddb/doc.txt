JVP finally changing anti-India rhetoric - Namal Rajapaksa

Colombo, Feb 06 -  Amidst questions raised over NPP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake's visit to India for discussions, SLPP MP Namal Rajapaksa has welcomed Dissanayake's Indian visit, signaling a potential shift in the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna's (JVP) stance on Indian investments which the JVP had for years criticized and neglected.

Rajapaksa emphasized the importance of fostering unity and collective efforts in welcoming foreign investments to bolster Sri Lanka's development agenda.

Rajapaksa's remarks highlighted historical contexts, drawing attention to past JVP conflicts surrounding development projects like the Sampur power plant.

He further said that the Sampur Power Project was an example of the loss faced by the country as a result of the JVP’s anti-India policies.

“However, the JVP has now reached a different view and has engaged in a tour to India, which is a good thing,” he said.

Rajapaksa said that he believes, following their visit to India, the JVP will support investors coming into Sri Lanka.

A JVP delegation led by MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake is in India for a five-day visit on an invitation extended by the Indian government.

The delegation is scheduled to visit three cities —New Delhi, Ahmedabad, and Thiruvananthapuram — and hold meetings with government officials, and members of the business community, in addition to visiting centres of excellence in agriculture and industry.
