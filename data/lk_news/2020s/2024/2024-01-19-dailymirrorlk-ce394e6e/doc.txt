Police vow stringent action against Sub Inspector in shooting incident after pursuit

Colombo, Jan 19 (Daily Mirror) - A Special Investigation Unit is probing the tragic incident in Narammala where a 41-year-old man lost his life when police accidentally opened fire on him.

Police Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa said that acting on the instructions of Acting Inspector General of Police Deshabandu Thennakoon, a special police team is already on-site conducting an inquiry into the actions of the involved police officers.

He said that initial findings have revealed that the concerned Sub Inspector had not adhered to proper procedures while carrying out his duties and was also in civilian attire during the incident.

The spokesman said the officer will face both disciplinary action and maximum legal consequences following a thorough investigation.

Meanwhile, the Public Security Ministry said that Police Headquarters is actively engaged in providing support to the victim's family.

Tensions escalated in front of the Narammala police station as a lorry driver fell victim to an accidental discharge from a sub-inspector's firearm last night.

It was reported that the police had ordered the driver to stop the lorry but the driver had allegedly defied the order. Police said the 59-year old Sub-Inspector and a Constable had chased behind the lorry and pulled it over for a spot inspection where the Sub-Inspector's firearm had discharged.

The driver who was critically injured was admitted to the Narammala Hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.

Both the Sub-Inspector and a Constable involved in the incident have been arrested.
