Wimal’s NFF decides not to contest 2024 General Election

The National Freedom Front (NFF) led by former MP Wimal Weerawansa has announced that they will not contest in the upcoming General Elections either as an alliance or independently.

Issuing a special statement, Weerawansa stated that there is no doubt that some opposition forces serve an “imperial agenda hostile to the country in order to make President Anura Kumara Dissanayake the second Gotabaya”.

He has further highlighted that neither he nor his party will contribute to making the country more vulnerable to crisis by representing that desire.
