Japan, UNFPA gift Sri Lanka reproductive health mobile units

ECONOMYNEXT – The United Nations Population Fund has donated three mobile clinics, funded by the Government of Japan with a total grant amount of USD 4.6 million, to Sri Lanka’s Health Ministry.

The project hopes to ensure access to life-saving sexual and reproductive health, and provide gender-based violence prevention and response services for women, girls and vulnerable groups.

The mobile ‘Health on Wheels’ clinics powered by solar energy, will deliver “essential health care services directly to those in need, regardless of their location” and “will expand access to critical maternal and reproductive health care services, particularly for marginalized communities, both during current crises and in post-disaster situations,” UNFPA said in a statement.

The specially designed vehicles are equipped with a medical compartment with emergency gynecological facilities, including a gynecological bed and medical equipment, to be deployed for health services in areas in case of an emergency.
