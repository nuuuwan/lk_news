Launching The Routes we Take: Sri Lanka’s first creative Green Map

“The Routes we Take” is a project by EUNIC Sri Lanka and Good Life X. EUNIC – European Union National Institutes for Culture – is Europe’s network of national cultural institutes and organisations, with 36 members from all EU Member States and associate countries. EUNIC Sri Lanka – consisting of Alliance Française and the Embassy of France in Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Goethe-Institut, British Council, Swiss Embassy, Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Embassy of Italy, with the support of the EU Delegation, adopts an integrated approach to building cultural relations and creative collaborations and supporting diversity.

Good Life X, partnering with the European Union National Institutes for Culture (EUNIC) cluster organizations, has brought forth a first-of-its-kind initiative to collect and document Sri Lanka’s creative practitioners, be it individuals, collectives, organizations or businesses on a digital and printed map. The participants on the map are selected based on their practice working with topics related to sustainability, circularity and symbiotic relationships with people and the planet. “The Routes We Take” was conceptualized as a response to the growing environmental issues and the key role which creatives play as part of the answer.

The project will end with an experiential weekend in Colombo, with the selected creatives having the opportunity to showcase their skill, talent, vision and craft to an engaging audience consisting of professionals, students, leaders in the creative industries, potential collaborators, relevant public and private sector stakeholders, and the press.
