Sri Lanka sets December 12 deadline to exchange defaulted bonds

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet of ministers have approved the exchange of new bonds for defaulted sovereign bonds, Deputy Minister of Economic Development Anil Jayantha said.

“The cabinet approved the proposal to for exchanging new bonds for presently existing bonds,” Jayantha told reporters on Tuesday.

The decision was made within the parameters of the debt sustainability analysis by the International Monetary Fund, he said.

Sri Lanka has invited bondholders to tender the old bonds by December 12, a government statement said.

Sri Lanka is exchanging the new bonds for defaulted bonds of 12.55 billion.

In September, an initial agreement was reached with the international bondholders on restructuring of sovereign debt of 14.2 billion US dollars, after a compromise discussion with the adhoc bondholders, a group of representatives of international investors, and a local consortium of Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka plans to present its national budget on February 14.
