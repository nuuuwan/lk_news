In a joint press briefing on Wednesday, Chief Organiser of the ruling party and Minister Prasanna Ranatunga, along with Minister Manusha Nanayakkara and MP Mahinda Nanayakkara, called for public support to continue on the path of economic stability and development, urging everyone to look at the situation intelligently and make informed decisions.

The law-makers collectively assured the public that the Government will adhere to Constitutional requirements and not postpone the upcoming elections. This assurance from the Government comes amidst discussions about the upcoming elections and the ongoing efforts to stabilise economy. Ranatunga highlighted that the Government aims to establish stability by holding a Presidential election first, followed by a general election next year.  He credited President Ranil Wickremesinghe for stabilising the country over the past two years, despite the severe economic crisis.  Addressing concerns about potential election delays, Ranatunga stated, “We must first go for a constitutionally required Presidential election to ensure stability in the country. Once we win the Presidential election, we can proceed with the General Election next year.”  Minister Nanayakkara criticised the main Opposition SJB for their hypocritical politics and efforts to destabilise the country during times of positive developments.   He elaborated the importance of unity and cooperation to move the country forward.

SLPP MP Aluthgamage pointed out that despite significant economic recovery; the Opposition continues to create unrest.  He urged public servants not to fall into the trap of politically motivated strikes and protests.
