Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana yesterday held a meeting with China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA) Vice President Yang Weiqun on the sidelines of the Second High-Level Conference of the Forum on Global Action for Shared Development organised by CIDCA, which took place from 12-13 July in Beijing.

In a post on ‘X’, Siriwardana described the meeting as ‘very productive.’

He discussed the progress Sri Lanka has made in managing its deep and complex economic crisis, highlighting the measures being implemented to ensure macroeconomic stability and achieve high, sustainable, and green economic growth.

Siriwardana expressed his gratitude to Chinese authorities, including the EXIM Bank of China, for their assistance to Sri Lanka.

He particularly noted the strong support from China, along with member countries in the Official Creditors Committee (OCC), co-chaired by France, India, and Japan, in successfully completing Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring process.

He also thanked the China Development Bank (CDB) for its support in the debt restructuring process and assured China’s continued partnership as a trustworthy and friendly development ally.

Additionally, Siriwardana said he had a brief discussion on Sri Lanka’s economic recovery efforts with Prof. Jeffrey Sachs of the Centre for Sustainable Development at the Earth Institute, Columbia University, USA.
