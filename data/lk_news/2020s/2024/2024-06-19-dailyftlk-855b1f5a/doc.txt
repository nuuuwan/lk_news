Thailand to become first Southeast Asian nation to legalise same-sex marriage

CNN – Thailand will become the first nation in Southeast Asia to legalise same-sex marriage after the Kingdom’s Senate approved a Marriage Equality Bill on Tuesday, with supporters calling it a “monumental step forward for LGBTQ+ rights.”

The Senate voted overwhelmingly in favour of passing the bill following a final reading, with 130 senators voting in favour. Only four members opposed the bill. The bill still requires endorsement from the King before marriage equality can become a reality in Thailand, but this process is considered a formality. The law will then come into effect 120 days after it is published in the Royal Gazette.

The result of the vote means that Thailand will become only the third place in Asia to allow for marriage equality after Taiwan legalised same-sex marriage in 2019 and Nepal in 2023.
