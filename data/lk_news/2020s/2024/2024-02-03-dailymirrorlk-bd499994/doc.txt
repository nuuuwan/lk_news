Poonam Pandey says ’’Didn’t die of cervical cancer’’

India- Feb 03 - Pandey, model and reality TV star, today announced that she hasn't died of cervical cancer. Her announcement on Instagram came a day after the model's manager announced that she had died of cervical cancer.

"I am alive. I didn't die of cervical cancer. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about the hundreds and thousands of women who have lost their lives due to cervical cancer."

"I am sorry caused this tear and I am sorry to those I have hurt. My intention: to shock everyone into the conversation that we are not talking enough about - cervical cancer," she said in another post.

She said that her "death" post was an effort to initiate a conversation and spread awareness about cervical cancer.

"Unlike some other cancers, Cervical Cancer is entirely preventable. The key lies in the HPV vaccine and early detection tests. We have the means to ensure no one loses their life to this disease," she said.

The model is being heavily criticised by social media users for "faking her death" to spread awareness about the disease.
