Sri Lanka’s Access to complete substructure of halted airport terminal

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Access Engineering will complete the substructure of a new terminal which was halted by a Japanese contractor after the island defaulted on its foreign debt in 2022.

State-run Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Limited said the Access will be paid by its own funds and concurrence has been obtained from the Japan International Co-operation Agency which was funding the terminal expansion.

Access will work under the direct supervision of consultants to the project, Japan Airport Consultants, Inc and Nippon Koei Co. Ltd.

Access will install 68 remaining piles, construct pile caps and ground beams at the Main Terminal Building (MTB), Pier 2, and Pier 3, as well as the partial completion of an underground utility tunnel in Pier No 2 and 3.

The work will also address the issue of deterioration of steel reinforcements.

The work will reduce the cost and time required for carrying out substructure works of the project when a new contractor is found for the project later, AASL said.

Sri Lanka’s cabinet of ministers last week approved the award of the contract to Access Engineering. (Colombo/Apr08/2024)
