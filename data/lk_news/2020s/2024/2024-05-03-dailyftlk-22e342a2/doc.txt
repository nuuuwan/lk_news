SLT-Mobitel introduces social combo plan for the first time

Elevating the user experience of social media enthusiasts across Sri Lanka, SLT-Mobitel has introduced a first of its kind Snapchat Chill Social Combo Mobile Plan, specifically designed to empower the social media lovers to stay connected and share their moments by providing essential data and communication services.

The Social Combo Mobile plan offers a range of benefits, including a dedicated social media bundle with options for 1 Day, 7 Day, or 30 Day versions based on user preference and convenience.

Monthly users can enjoy 15 GB data (512 MB per day) for popular platforms such as Snapchat, TikTok, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Google Maps along with 5 GB of anytime data for browsing and internet access, as well as 750 minutes for calls and SMS to any network, all for an amazing rental of only Rs. 646.

For a 7-day plan, users receive 3.5 GB (512 MB daily) dedicated for Snapchat, TikTok, Instagram, WhatsApp and Google Maps coupled with 1 GB of anytime data for browsing and internet access, as well as 150 minutes for calls and SMS to any network, with rental of only Rs. 192 per week. Even if it is just for a single day, across 24 hours, the Snapchat Chill plan remains accessible to users. They receive 0.5 GB for the Social Apps with additional 125 MB Anytime Data, 20 minutes for calls and SMS to any network, with rentals of only Rs. 42 per day.

Any SLT-Mobitel Mobile pre-paid customer can enjoy the benefits of the Social Combo Mobile plan, whether they are new customers or existing ones. Activating the plan is easy and convenient, with options to reload through various channels such as retail shops, mobile stores, or banking apps, or by dialling #170# USSD or the Self Care App. Users can conveniently check the available benefits of their Data Bundles for the specified social media apps through the SLT-Mobitel Mobile Self-care App. If the daily quota for the Social Apps is exhausted, users can still stay connected by utilising the Anytime Data bundle included in the plan, or by activating a standard data pack through the SLT-Mobitel Self-care app.

The plan also offers the flexibility to activate multiple Social Combo plans based on individual needs and preferences.

Videos on platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat are optimised for viewing pleasure at SD (Standard Definition) quality, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience while conserving data usage.
