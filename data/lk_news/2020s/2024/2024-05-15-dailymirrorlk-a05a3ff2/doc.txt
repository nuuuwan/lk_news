Public asked not to panic over AstraZeneca vaccine

Colombo, May 15 (Daily Mirror) - In the wake of the recent mass withdrawal of AstraZeneca vaccines due to concerns over rare blood clots, Sri Lanka health experts emphasized that individuals who have received the AstraZeneca vaccine need not harbour undue fears regarding its safety.

Addressing the media, Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama, Chairman of the National Medicinal Drugs Regulatory Authority, referenced a case in which the manufacturer of AstraZeneca acknowledged that complications from the vaccine are exceedingly rare, a fact they had previously admitted.

He underscored that these rare complications are not indicative of future adverse effects, providing reassurance on the overall safety profile of the vaccine.
