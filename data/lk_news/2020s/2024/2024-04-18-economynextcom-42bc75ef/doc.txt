Sri Lanka electricity sector reforms gazetted

ECONOMYNEXT – The proposed electricity sector reforms was published in the Gazette yesterday as the Sri Lanka Electricity Bill, and will be presented to the Parliament in the next sitting week, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said.

“The Public will have two weeks from the day of presenting the Bill to the Parliament to challenge its legality in the Supreme Court,” Wijesekera said on X (twitter).

Amendments suggested by the stakeholders in January have been drafted in to the revised Bill, the minister said.

Sri Lanka’s Cabinet approved a proposal to restructure the CEB; under the plan the CEB will be split into eight separate companies.

The CEB consists of around 26,000 workers when the enterprise needs only around 50 percent of it, Wijesekera has said earlier. A voluntary retirement plan also will be offered.

The government wants to reform or privatize state enterprises after the country ended up in sovereign default after several years of money printing and currency depreciation.

A condition of the IMF program is reform of state-owned enterprises, including the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).(Colombo/Feb14/2024)
