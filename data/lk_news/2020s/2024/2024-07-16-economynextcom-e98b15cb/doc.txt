Sri Lanka stocks close down, Sampath and Pan Asia banks push turnover

ECONOMYNEXT – The Colombo Stock Exchange closed up on Tuesday, data on its site showed.

The broader All Share Index closed down 0.11 percent, or 13.23 points, at 11,878; while the more liquid S&P SL20 Index closed up 0.03 percent, or 1.11 points, at 3,474.

Turnover was 1 million. Banks and capital goods sectors contributed the most.

“All in all there was mixed signals in the  market today, with the ASPI closing in red, and the S&P in green,” Softlogic Stockbrokers said.

“Market is holding on, though we are yet to see big numbers on the board.”

Two crossings brought in nearly half of the day’s turnover with interest picking up on banking sector counters.

Local activity was seen on Pan Asia Banking Corporation Plc. This was local institutions buying and selling, which contributed Rs256mn to the turnover, and the share closed up at 21.00.

“Investor interest was seen on the banking counters especially from the foreign front.”

However, with exception of Hatton National Bank Plc which was up at 196.00, and Union Bank of Colombo Plc which was up at 9.50, all other banking stocks closed down or flat.

Diversified conglomerates Hemas Holdings Plc (Rs40mn) and Hayleys Plc (Rs66mn) saw investor interest; both shares closed flat at 81.40 and 101.25 respectively.

The top contributors to the ASPI were Sampath Bank Plc (up at 77.80), John Keells Holdings Plc (up at 195.50), and Aitken Spence Plc (up at 126.50).

There was a net foreign inflow of 252 million. (Colombo/Jul16/2024)
