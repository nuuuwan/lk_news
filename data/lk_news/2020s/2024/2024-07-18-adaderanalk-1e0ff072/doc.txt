Criminal gang member “Piyuma” remanded

The Fort Magistrate’s Court has ordered for underworld criminal gang member Piyum Hasthika alias “Piyuma” to be remanded in custody until July 31.

This order was issued when the suspect, who was detained under the custody of the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) after being repatriated to Sri Lanka from Dubai, was produced before the court today (18).

Piyum Hasthika alias “Piyuma”, who is reportedly the main accomplice of the notorious underworld figure and drug trafficker Salindu Malshika Gunaratne alias “Kudu Salindu,” was repatriated to Sri Lanka from Dubai, UAE on February 15, 2024.

Subsequently, the CID secured detention orders under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to interrogate the suspect.

According to Sri Lanka Police, “Piyuma” was first arrested in 2018 for the possession of 20g of heroin and had been referred to a rehabilitation centre for three months.

He was reportedly complicit in the January 2021 shooting that claimed the life of a youth named Lakshan Sandaruwan in Panadura North. Two years after the murder, he was listed as the 8th suspect after he was identified as one of the two assailants involved. The investigating officers later learned that “Piyuma” had fled to Dubai to evade arrest.

In June 2022, “Piyuma” was involved in another shooting, which he had orchestrated under the instructions of “Kudu Salindu” for the killing of Nilantha Kumara and Mohammed Samsad in Katubedda, Moratuwa. He was later named as the 5th suspect in this double murder.

On this account, a ‘Red Notice’ was subsequently secured from Interpol in November 2023 to apprehend “Piyuma” and repatriate him to the island.
