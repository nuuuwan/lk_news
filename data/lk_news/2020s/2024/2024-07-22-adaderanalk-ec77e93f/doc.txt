‘25% of children in poverty’: Sajith reveals plans for eradicating child poverty

Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa states that as severe economic challenges hit the nation, 25% of the child population is suffering from child poverty, highlighting the need for the initiation of a national programme to eradicate child poverty.

“In a situation where the country is grappling with a scarcity of rupees and dollars, 25% of the child population is suffering from poverty, we cannot stay idle,” he said.

Premadasa underscored the urgent need for a national programme to eradicate child poverty, emphasizing the multifaceted impact of economic hardship on children.

“Children are unable to attend school due to their economic difficulties. As a result, they do not receive a proper education, fail their examinations, and subsequently struggle to secure jobs. This failure to earn an income perpetuates the vicious cycle of child poverty,” he explained.

Furthermore, he mentioned: “We will implement a special national programme aimed at eradicating child poverty before the end of this year. A Presidential Task Force tasked with eradicating child poverty must be established.”

Premadasa made these remarks while attending the 357th iteration of the ‘Sakwala’ programme held at the Mahagamasekara Maha Vidyalaya, Gampaha today (22).
