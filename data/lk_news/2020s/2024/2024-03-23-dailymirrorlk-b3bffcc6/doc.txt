Bangladesh falters, all out for 188 as Sri Lanka takes command in first Test

Sylhet , March 23 - Bangladesh lost their final four wickets in the second session for 56 runs to be bundled out for 188 in 51.3 overs, conceding a 92-run first innings lead to Sri Lanka on the second day of the first Test at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium today.

Khaled Ahmed was the last batter to depart, nicking a ball to the keeper from Vishwa Fernando, after making 22 off 28, an innings that helped Bangladesh bring the deficit below the three-figure mark.

Khaled's wicket ended a disappointing batting performance from the Tigers, where night-watchman Taijul Islam was the standout performer with a fighting 47.

Sri Lanka pace trio of Fernando, Kasum Rajitha and Lahiru Kumara shared the 10 wickets, with Fernando leading the charge with 4 for 48 and Rajitha and Kumara taking three wickets each.

Earlier, Bangladesh had started the day's play on 32 for three. The hosts three wickets in the first session, all falling to Kumara, and lost the remaining four after the lunch interval, with Rajitha and Fernando picking up a couple of wickets each.
