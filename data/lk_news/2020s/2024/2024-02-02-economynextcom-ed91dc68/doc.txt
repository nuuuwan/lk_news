Sri Lanka’s Colombo Port builds expertise to be key hub backed by US

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Colombo Port has embarked on an exercise to build technical expertise, introduce global best practices as it aims to double capacity and become a maritime hub for the region expanding its service offering.

The Colombo Plan program with funding from the United States is carrying out the three-year program.

“The program will build human resources as the port competes in the region as a major hub,” lead consultant to the program Rohan Masakorale said.

Colombo Port has already started building terminals that will see capacity doubling to 15 million containers by 2026, Sri Lanka Ports Authority Chairman Keith Bernard said.

The program will boost sustainability of maritime and port operations in Sri Lanka by introducing modern port systems, new technologies, and international best practices.

The initiative will see technical training exchanges, conferences, visits to US ports and workshops conducted by both local and international experts.

US Ambassador Julie Chung said the program will help boost the efficiency and reduce vessel turnaround times.

The US separately was also funding a new terminal at the port being built by India’s Adani and Sri Lanka’ John Keells Holdings.

This collaborative effort aims to enhance the capabilities of ports, improving efficiencies and expanding the delivery of value-added services.
