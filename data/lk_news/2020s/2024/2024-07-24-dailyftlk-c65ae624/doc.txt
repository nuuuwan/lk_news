Govt. to implement national social protection policy

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved a new national social protection policy aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and coherence of the social protection system.

The proposal, presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policy Minister seeks to address inefficiencies and fragmented efforts that have hindered the country’s social protection initiatives and national development.

“The Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policy Ministry identified the need for a coordinated national policy to provide strategic guidance and ensure the participation of all relevant stakeholders. The newly formulated policy aims to develop a properly coordinated and coherent approach to social protection,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said yesterday.

Speaking at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing, he highlighted that successive Governments had implemented various social protection schemes, but these programs often fell short of their goals due to improper execution and lack of identifying target groups.

“The new policy would address these shortcomings and focus on reaching the most vulnerable communities and start rolling out the policy from next year onwards,” he added.

He said the Government plans to launch a widespread awareness campaign to inform the public about the new policy and its benefits soon.
