‘March 12 Movement’ slams Online Safety Bill, accuses govt of overlooking SC recommendations

The ‘March 12 Movement’, a collective of election watchdogs and the civil society, has issued a statement strongly denouncing the passage of the Online Safety Bill, emphasising that it poses a grave threat to the fundamental rights enshrined within the Constitution of Sri Lanka.

“The current government’s adamant pursuit of this legislation is a clear indication of its intention to silence dissent and suppress civic activism during this critical time of economic reform and upcoming elections”, the statement read.

The March 12 Movement further accused the government of violating the “constitutionally guaranteed right to pre-enactment judicial review of legislation”, in addition to introducing the undemocratic law.

They also revealed that the Supreme Court’s recommendations in relation to amendments appropriate for the Bill were “completely overlooked” during its passage, adding that the although the relevant legislation was debated in Parliament using standing orders, its passage potentially undermines the “established Westminster-model parliamentary tradition”.

“While the citizens silently suffer amidst escalating cost of living and unmanageable hunger, it is crucial for the rulers to recognize that this silence does not equate to obedience”, the statement further read, warning that such an assumption is the “precursor to a major backlash against the government’s coercive rule”.

Thus, the March 12 Movement urged the Speaker to ensure that the amendments outlined in the recommendations listed by the Supreme Court are fully incorporated into the Online Safety Bill, adding that “following due process when passing laws, and respecting the judiciary and the sovereignty of citizens, is essential to promote clean politics and reinforce democracy in Sri Lanka”.
