Committee report on CBSL salary hikes submitted to COPF

The report of the committee appointed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to review the salary increase of officials ofÂ the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has been handed over to the Committee on Public Finance (COPF).

Chairman of the Committee on Public Finance, Dr. Harsha de Silva, informed the Parliament today that he has received the relevant report.

Accordingly, he stated that the report has pointed out that the salary increase of CBSL officials should not have been implemented.

On April 01, President Wickremesinghe, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, appointed an Independent Remuneration Committee to review the salary increase of the Central Bank officials.

The Independent Remuneration Committee members include Mr Dinesh Stephen Weerakkody, Mr Arjuna Herath, Dr Indrajit Coomaraswamy, Mrs Sudharma Karunarathne, Mr Anthony Nihal Fonseka, Mr Anushka S Wijesinha and Mr Duminda Hulangamuwa.

Responding to mounting pressures from Members of Parliament and the Committee on Public Finance (CoPF), President Wickremesinghe established an independent remuneration committee to review the contentious salary hike based on the recommendations delineated in the CoPF report on CBSL salary revision.
