Asthma on the rise among children, parents urged to exercise caution

Colombo, Feb 9 (Daily Mirror) - Health experts in Sri Lanka have sounded the alarm over a noticeable uptick in asthma cases among children, sparking concerns among parents.

Dr. Deepal Perera, a Paediatrician at the Lady Ridgeway Children's Hospital in Colombo, attributed this concerning surge to the prevailing extreme heat.

"As schools gear up for sports meets, where children engage in numerous outdoor activities amidst the scorching weather, they become more vulnerable to asthma triggers," Dr. Perera warned, urging parents to remain vigilant about their children's health.

Furthermore, Dr. Perera emphasized the importance of keeping children away from smoking areas, as exposure to smoke can exacerbate respiratory complications, particularly in those with asthma.

"Common symptoms of childhood asthma include shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing and persistent coughing," he cautioned
