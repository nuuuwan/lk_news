Rice millers agree to supply at controlled price: Trade Minister

Rice millers agreed to supply 200,000 kilograms of rice daily to the market through ‘Lanka Sathosa’ at a controlled price of Rs. 220 per kilo, effective from yesterday.

The move was confirmed by Trade Minister Wasantha Samarasinghe during the Parliament session yesterday.

“During the recent discussion with rice mill owners, they claimed that the rice stocks in the mills cannot be released to the market due to an issue with the banks. On Tuesday, we provided them with a solution for that issue,” he added.

The Trade Minister also assured that 1 million coconuts will be sold through Sathosa outlets in the suburbs at a price of Rs. 130 per coconut, over the next two weeks.

Samarasinghe added that coconut products obtained from State-owned plantations will be sold at low prices in this manner.
