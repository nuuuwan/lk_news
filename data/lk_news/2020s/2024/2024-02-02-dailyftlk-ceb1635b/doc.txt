Immunoglobin Scam - Court imposes travel ban on Keheliya

CID informs court on previous occasion that minutes from files seized from Rambukwella on immunoglobulin procurement were missing

Maligakanda Magistrate Lochani Abeywickrama imposed a travel ban on former Minister of Health Keheliya Rambukwella in connection to the case regarding the controversial immunoglobulin scam yesterday.

The Magistrate also ordered Rambukwella to present himself before the Police Criminal Investigations Department (CID) at 9.00 a.m. today when the case was taken up for consideration before the court.

The order was issued in consideration of the Ministerâ€™s refusal to appear before the CID on a previous occasion.

Earlier this week, the CID notified the Maligakanda Magistrate Court that minutes from the files seized from former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, related to the fraudulent acquisition of counterfeit immunoglobulin were missing.

CID investigators noted that the log entries and minutes were present in other files related to Cabinet decisions. However, it was disclosed in court that the minutes were absent from the files concerning Cabinet memoranda dated 30 May, 27 September, 25 October, and 5 December 2022.

The Secretary to the Ministry of Health released these files to the CID, following an order from Maligakanda Magistrate Lochani Abeywickrema, prompted by a request from Deputy Solicitor General Lakmini Girihagama, leading the prosecution on behalf of the Attorney General.

Meanwhile the Magistrate yesterday released one suspect arrested in relation to the case on bail. Accordingly, the fifth accused, a storekeeper was released on two surety bonds of Rs. 1 million each.

The court extended the remand order for the former Secretary of the Ministry of Health Janaka Chandragupta, and six other suspects until 15 February.
