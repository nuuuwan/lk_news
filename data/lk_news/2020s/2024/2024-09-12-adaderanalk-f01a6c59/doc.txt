2024 Presidential Election: 77% of polling cards distributed

The Postal Department says that around 77% of official polling cards for the 2024 presidential election have already been distributed thus far.

Deputy Postmaster General Rajitha Ranasinghe says that the distribution of nearly 13.2 million official polling cards has already been completed.

He further said that the polling cards will also be distributed to the voters tomorrow (13) and the day after (14).

Ranasinghe said that if any voter has not received their official polling cards by Saturday, they can visit their local post office with their National Identity Card (NIC) after September 18 to verify their identity and obtain their polling card.

He stated that this opportunity will be available for the voters until the date of the presidential election, which will be held on September 21.
