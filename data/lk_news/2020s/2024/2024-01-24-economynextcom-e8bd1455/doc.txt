Sri Lanka inflation to top 6.0-pct in early 2023: CB Governor

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s inflation will top 6.0 percent in January and February 2024, partly due to the imposition of value added tax, but ease later, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.

The central bank had under an agreement signed with President Ranil Wickremesinghe which allows the agency to generate up too 7 percent inflation.

“In the first couple of months there will be a some increase just above the middle path, may be 6.0 percent,” Governor Weerasinghe said.

“Probably in the month of January and February it will remain. We have a projection that it will remain around high levels for some time and then it will come down back to 5 percent in the medium term.”

A hike in value added tax will contribute to the rise in the index in early 2024, as well as a statistical base effect, he said.

Sri Lanka’s vegetable prices have also spiked in recent weeks amid excessive rains.

In the absence of monetary accommodation, or depreciation prices of individual items which come go up to a fall in supply, will come back down to previous levels, analysts say.

Sri Lanka’s central bank has generally operated deflationary open market operations, but has printed 2026 money, changing rupee reserves of individual banks allowing them to overtrade. (Colombo/Jan24/2023)
