Vietnam Pho Day in Sri Lanka on December 07

ECONOMYNEXT – A ‘Pho’s Day’, marking the celebration of Vietnam cuisine featuring an iconic noodle soup, will be held on Saturday December 07, the Vietnamese embassy in Colombo said.

“Phở in Vietnamese or Pho in English (pronounced “fuh”) stands as the crown jewel of Vietnamese cuisine as well as the country’s national dish,” the embassy said in a statement.

“This aromatic noodle soup graces tables across Viet Nam, from humble household kitchens to bustling street stalls and elegant restaurants.”

The dish will be at the Viet Nam stall, in ‘International Bazaar and Cultural Extravaganza 2024’ at the  Colombo Racecourse, organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism, Sri Lanka Foreign Service Association and Good Market.

The opening ceremony will be held at 1000 am, the Foreign Ministry said.

Originated in northern Viet Nam in the early 20th century, Phở is made with meticulously prepared bone-beef broth, bánh phở noodles (rice noodles), and tender slices of beef, the statement said.

“Phở is not just a dish, but a symbol of Viet Nam’s culinary culture,” the statement said.

Over the years, Phở has evolved out of the classic beef version into flavours like chicken.

The key to Phở is a broth of made a rich mix of flavors created by slowly simmering beef or chicken bones with aromatic spices like star anise, cinnamon, charred onions, and ginger.

Each bowl is eaten with fresh herbs such as spring onions, coriander, and bean sprouts, with lime wedges and chili sauce added.  (Colombo/Dec06/2024)
