Sri Lanka inflation rise only 3.3-pct over 21-months to June 2024

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s inflation rose 3.3 percent over 21 months from October 22 when monetary stability was reached, data from the state statistics office showed with 12-month inflation at 1.7 percent.

The widely watched Colombo Consumer Price Index went up 0.77 percent over the the month of June.

The central bank has operated largely deflationary policy though excess liquidity was allowed to build up over April and May, leading to some downward pressure on the rupee due the so-called ‘flexible’ exchange rate which critics say is riddled with anchor conflicts.

Under the flexible exchange rate with a reserve target, the International Monetary Fund encourage countries with monetary instability to buy dollars to prevent currency strengthening but discourages sales, when credit boost import demand, leading to confidence shocks to both exchange and market rates.

Since September 2022 when monetary stability was reached the exchange rate has been allowed to appreciate from 360 to the 305 to the US dollar.

The central bank has provided a strong stable foundation for people and businesses to resume economic activities by undershooting its 5-7 inflation target under which the agency had triggered serial currency crises and default after the end of a civil war.

The exchange rate is currently under pressure due to money exchange rate conflict emerging. However private credit is weak and state credit is under control.

Analysts have warned that due to a deeply flawed operational framework riddled with multiple anchor conflicts, the external sector could be blown apart and currency could begin to weaken as before as soon as private credit resumes. (Colombo/June29/2024)
