Shortage of 5,000 buses hampers private passenger transport services

Colombo, June 1 (Daily Mirror) - A shortage of 5,000 private buses is making it difficult to provide adequate passenger transport services, Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) chairman Gemunu Wijerathne claimed.

He told the Daily Mirror that 70% of buses with valid route permits are running in the country, while the remaining buses are not operating properly.

He noted that buses with valid route permits cannot provide proper services because some are undergoing major repairs or are engaged in other services.

As a result, the existing private bus fleet has been reduced to 13,000, and even these buses sometimes do not operate properly, Wijerathne said.

"As a result, people have to pay Rs. 100 for three-wheeler fares to travel a minimum distance of one kilometre. The shortage of private buses has severely impacted the transport sector, with people suffering the most when relying on public transport," he said.

Responsible authorities have failed to arrange proper timetables, leaving rural areas without bus services. Consequently, people are forced to depend on three-wheelers, resulting in higher charges, Wijerathne said.
