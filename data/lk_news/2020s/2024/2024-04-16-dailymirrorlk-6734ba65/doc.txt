Sri Lanka cannot be pushed into global conflict: SJB MP

Colombo, April 16 (Daily Mirror)- Sri Lanka cannot be pushed and bumped into a global conflict and therefore it should be diligent in its dealings with various nations, a Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP said today.

SJB MP Harshana Rajakaruna came out with this remark when asked about his party’s stance on the visit of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi to Sri Lanka on April 24 this year.

“Sri Lanka cannot afford to be pushed and bumped into a global conflict and we expect the rulers of our country to be diligent in dealing with various nations. Sri Lanka should take a neutral stand on the conflict in the Middle East,” the MP said.

“Sri Lanka should maintain sound diplomatic ties with all nations in the world,” he added.
