No plan to support UNP or any other party, will only help rebuild SLFP: CBK

ECONOMYNEXT — Former president Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga has no intention of helping the United National Party (UNP) or any other party, but will only assist in the rebuilding of the fractured Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) so long as it can be done, Kumaratunga said.

At a press conference held Monday April 29 morning, Kumaratunga said the SLFP, the party she led for over a decade, has splinted into several factions and must be built from the ground up.

“The SLFP has fractured and is now split to six or seven groups. It has been fallen to zero,” she said, lamenting the state of a party that she said has ruled the country for over 40 years, representing the aspirations of the people.

“The SLFP ruled this country for 40 years. Party supporters have nowhere to go. I plan to do what I can using my knowledge and experience to develop young leaders, not just for politics but for the country,” said Kumaratunga.

The former president claimed that Sri Lanka’s current crop of politicians will do anything to gain power and enjoy the perks of that power.

“I never did that kind of politics. I don’t want to do politics with any of the politicians now,” she said.

“I was asked to take the party chairmanship, I said no. I will only help if the SLFP can be developed to some level. That’s it,” she added.

Kumaratunga also dismissed speculation that she intends to support President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s United National Party (UNP) at the upcoming presidential election.

“Now the biggest lie being told is that Chandrika has come here to help the UNP. I have no such intention,” she said.

“I will hep if the SLFP can be developed. People walk up to me on the road and say ‘madam, please come and take over the party. We made a mistake and voted for the SLPP, we won’t again.’ Because of that, I will help. But I have no intention of supporting any party,” she said. (Colombo/Apr29/2024)
