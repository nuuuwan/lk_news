Flaws in debt restructuring slow down share trading

The stock market got off to a sluggish start yesterday because both local and foreign investors are worrying over certain flaws in the external debt restructuring exercise, stock market analysts said.

Due to deeply flawed operational frameworks, built on statistics rejecting classical economic principles and laws of nature, currencies of IMF dependent countries tend to depreciate permanently; nominal interest rates and inflation tend to be high, critics said.

Amid those developments both indices indicated mixed reactions. The All Share Price Index went up by 12.19 points while S and P SL20 rose by 2.7 points. Turnover stood at Rs 1.5 billion with six crossings. Those crossings were reported in Windforce, which crossed 22.5 million shares to the tune of Rs 439 million; its shares traded at Rs 19.50, Central Finance 1.9 million shares crossed for Rs 220 million and its shares traded at Rs 115, Hayleys 500,000 shares crossed for Rs 53.8 million; it shares sold at Rs 107.50, JKH 200,000 shares crossed for Rs 41.15 million; its shares traded at Rs 205.75, Sanasa Development Bank 1 million shares crossed to the tune of Rs 32 million; its shares sold at Rs 32 and HNB 100,000 shares crossed for Rs 20.6 million; its shares fetched Rs 206.

In the retail market top seven companies that mainly contributed to the turnover were; Hayleys Rs 167 million (1.6 million shares traded), JKH Rs 60 million (289,000 shares traded), Marawila Resorts Rs 50 million (11.5 million shares traded), Hemas Holdings Rs 44.7 million (525,000 shares traded), Sampath Bank Rs 34 million (428,000 shares traded), HNB (Non- Voting) Rs 30.8 million (189,000 shares traded) and Beruwala Resort Rs 30.6 million (10.9 million shares traded). During the day 75.2 million share volumes changed hands in 8488 transactions.

Yesterday the rupee was quoted at Rs 305.25/50 to the US dollar in early morning trade, steady from Rs 305.25/35 to the US dollar at the previous day’s close, while bonds were quoted wide, dealers said.

Bond market activity was somewhat muted after a rise in Treasury bill yields last week, dealers said.

Interest rates fell after a spike in un-sterilized liquidity from dollar purchases (strong side pegging), but the rupee comes under pressure due to lack of a complementary exchange rate policy to back the strong side pegging when liquidity is used up, analysts have said.

Excess liquidity is now down but the Central Bank is injecting some money overnight. Seven-day term money was injected below the overnight rate. At the moment private credit is still muted. A bond maturing on 01.06.2026 was quoted at 10.60/11.00 percent, indicative Wednesday, down from yesterday’s close of 10.75/11.05 percent. A bond maturing on 15.12.2026 was not quoted in morning trade. The bond closed at 10.65/11.05 percent Tuesday. A bond maturing on 15.10.2027 quoted at 10.70/11.10, marginally higher from 10.65/11.10 percent. A bond maturing on 15.03.2028 quoted at 11.25/50, marginally higher from 11.20/11.50 percent. A bond maturing on 15.09.2029 was quoted at 12.10/20, a little wider from 12.10/15 percent. A bond maturing on 01.12.2031 was quoted at 12.10/20, unchanged from 12.10/20 percent.
