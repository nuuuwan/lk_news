“I am proud to sign on as one of Cricket Australia’s Multicultural Ambassadors. I see the sport as a bridge that connects communities and welcomes all, fostering understanding, respect, and unity.

“As a sport we need to take the next step to ensure we get a greater and more equitable representation of the community, as a whole, by creating opportunities, celebrating our shared love for the game, and inspiring members of all backgrounds to get involved.”
