Gammanpila calls for transparency over Indo-Lanka ETCA

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila alleged that the signing of the Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) between Sri Lanka and India has been suspended untill the conclusion of the Parliamentary elections later this year.

Gammanpila cited “reliable Government sources” for his revelation during a media briefing.

He disclosed that the Indian Election Commission has announced the conclusion of the elections on 4 June, providing a three-month window before the signing of ETCA.

However, Gammanpila stressed the necessity for the Government to address four prerequisites before considering the agreement.

He asserted the importance of formulating a foreign trade agreement policy, highlighting the absence of criteria to assess the agreement’s impact on the country. He said the risk of negotiating trade agreements without predefined criteria, could result in unfavourable terms for Sri Lanka.

He also pointed out the lack of legislation outlining the procedure for signing free trade agreements, enabling Governments to secretively negotiate agreements without public scrutiny. He insisted on the need for transparency and accountability in the negotiation process.

Gammanpila also advocated for the mandatory publication of draft agreements one month before signing, coupled with Parliamentary debates lasting at least two days to ensure thorough scrutiny and public input. He cited recent instances where agreements were signed without public knowledge, underscoring the importance of transparency.

He also called for a comprehensive review of past trade agreements, including Sri Lanka’s first agreement with India in 1998, to evaluate their outcomes and report to Parliament. He highlighted the lack of previous reviews and emphasized the importance of learning from past experiences to inform future trade negotiations.

The PHU leader reiterated the importance of fulfilling these prerequisites before proceeding with the ECTA signing, asserting the need for transparency, accountability, and informed decision-making in Sri Lanka’s trade agreements.
