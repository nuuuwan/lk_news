Sri Lankan worker in Israel dies by suicide

A Sri Lankan man employed in Israel’s agricultural sector has tragically died by suicide, according to Sri Lanka’s Ambassador to Israel Nimal Bandara.

The 35-year-old man, a resident of Kandy, reportedly took his own life due to personal reasons, the Ambassador confirmed. The individual had been working in Israel for the past six months.

Efforts are currently being made to repatriate the body to Sri Lanka, Ambassador Bandara added.

Despite the ongoing volatile situation in the region, the Sri Lankan Government has recently been facilitating employment opportunities for Sri Lankans in Israel’s agriculture sector.
