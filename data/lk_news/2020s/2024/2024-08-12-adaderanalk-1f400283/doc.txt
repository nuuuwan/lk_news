Ali Sabry takes oath as new Justice Minister

Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry has taken oath as the new Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, before the President, a short while ago.

However on August 07, a Gazette notification was issued bringing the Ministry of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms under the purview of President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

This move came following the recent resignation of Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from his ministerial portfolios to contest the upcoming Presidential election.

On July 25, MP Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe officially announced that he would contest the upcoming Presidential Election while he stepped down from his ministerial position as the Minister of Justice, Prisons Affairs and Constitutional Reforms on July 29.
