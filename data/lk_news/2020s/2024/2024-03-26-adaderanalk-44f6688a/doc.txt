Govt. to provide 10kg of rice to low-income families before Avurudu

The government has decided to distribute rice to as many as 2.8 million low-income families, Finance State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya says.

Accordingly, it is planned to provide 20kg of rice to each family in April and May.

In the month of April, 10kg of rice will be given before the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, and the remaining 10kg within the first week of May, Siyambalapitiya added.

Speaking further, the state minister said that through this relief program, the government intends to benefit not only low-income families but also paddy farmers and small- and medium-scale rice mill owners.

This relief program, proposed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, was also green-lighted by the Cabinet of Ministers at its meeting held earlier this month.

The low-income families are planned to be identified through District Secretaries/Government Agents by involving small- and medium-scale mill owners.
