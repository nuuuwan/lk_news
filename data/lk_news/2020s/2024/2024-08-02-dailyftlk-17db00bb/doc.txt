EC to bar parties with secretarial crises from Presidential nominations

The Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL) has announced that political parties experiencing issues with their General Secretary posts will be prohibited from submitting nominations for the upcoming Presidential election.

ECSL Chairperson R.M.A.L. Ratnayake disclosed that several parties are currently facing confusion regarding their secretarial positions.

Ratnayake said that representatives from these parties will be called to the Election Commission in the coming days to decide who will be officially recognised as the party secretary. He warned that if the parties do not address these conflicts, they will be barred from participating in the Presidential nominations.

Nominations will be accepted on 15 August from 9.00 a.m. to 11.00 a.m. with the objection period running until 11.30 a.m. on the same day.
