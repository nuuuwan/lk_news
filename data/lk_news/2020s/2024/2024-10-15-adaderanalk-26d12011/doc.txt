Ex-President Ranil to deliver special statement

The Leader of the United National Party (UNP), former President Ranil Wickremesinghe has announced that he will make a special statement to the public on Thursday (17).

This will be the first time that Wickremesinghe makes a public statement following the 2024 Presidential Election.

It is reported that the former President will reveal ‘the political behavior of the country’ and his future plans in this special statement.

Immediately after the General Election was announced, Wickremesinghe declared that he will neither contest the election, nor expect to enter Parliament through the National List.

However, all political parties that supported former President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the recent Presidential Election are to contest the upcoming General Election under the New Democratic Front (NDF), with the ‘Gas Cylinder’ as their symbol.

Former President Wickremesinghe had also contested the presidential election under the symbol of the ‘Gas Cylinder’, albeit as an independent candidate.
