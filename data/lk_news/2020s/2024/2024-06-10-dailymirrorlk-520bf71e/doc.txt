Non-communicable diseases cause nearly 90% of deaths in Sri Lanka

Colombo, June 10 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka is facing a health crisis of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) which account for 89% of deaths, according to Health Secretary Dr. Palitha Mahipala.

The hardest hit are those aged 50 to 60, with four out of ten falling victim to NCDs.

“Each year, 60,000 Sri Lankans suffer strokes, resulting in 4,000 deaths and leaving thousands with serious health issues,” the health secretary underscored.

“Smoking is another major killer, causing 20,000 deaths annually,” he added.

To combat this, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is investing Rs 70 billion over the next five years. Their plan includes boosting primary health care and setting up five cardiac catheterization units across the island.
