Basil pledges continued support for President Ranil

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) founder former minister Basil Rajapaksa has declared their intention to continue supporting President Ranil Wickremesinghe with the country’s welfare in mind.

He made this statement while attending a ceremony in Kalutara to mark the 27th anniversary of MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena’s political career.

Rajapaksa emphasized that the SLPP’s support for Wickremesinghe was not motivated by fear, saying,    “President, whenever we work as part of the government in moving this party forward, we did not help you out of any fear. We state with great pride that we have no fear and no debt.”

He further noted that the party collectively decided Wickremesinghe had the capability to save the country at a crucial time, and they had been supporting him sincerely since then.

He assured that as long as the President continued to protect the country and its citizens, he would receive their full support.

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who also attended the event, stressed the importance of working with leadership that accepts challenges and moves the country forward, urging the people to support such leadership.
