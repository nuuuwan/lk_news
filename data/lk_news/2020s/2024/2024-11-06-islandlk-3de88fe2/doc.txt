Getting rid of Blackheads…

Who doesn’t like to have a clean and clear skin? But blackheads are a common type of skin condition that everyone usually faces at some point in their lives. Blackheads are a common skin condition that primarily affects the face, neck, back, and chest. There are several causes, including too much oil on your skin and irritation of your hair follicles.

Blackheads are most common in adolescents, but they can occur at any age, so this week I’ve worked on a remedy that should be of benefit to the readers of my column.

You will need 01 tablespoon of lemon juice and 01 tablespoon of egg white.

In a small bowl, mix the lemon juice and egg white. Whisk them together until well mixed and slightly frothy.

Wash your face with a gentle cleanser and pat it dry and apply the mask, using clean fingers, or a brush. Apply the mixture to areas with blackheads. Be careful to avoid your eyes.

Allow the mask to sit for about 15-20 minutes, or until you feel it’s dry.

Gently rinse your face with warm water to remove the mask. Pat your face dry with a towel.

Follow up with a gentle moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated.

Lemon Juice: Helps to exfoliate the skin and has natural astringent properties, which can reduce oiliness and tighten pores.

Egg White: Tightens the skin and can help pull out impurities, making it easier to remove blackheads.
