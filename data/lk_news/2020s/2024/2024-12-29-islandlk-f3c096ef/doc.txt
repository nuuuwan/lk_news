Preserving Ruhuna’s legacy: Suriya Jayalath Perera’s vision for Sri Lanka’s wilderness

Sri Lanka, a land teeming with biodiversity and historical significance, continues to captivate the global stage, thanks to individuals like Suriya Jayalath Perera. A celebrated wildlife photographer, researcher, and conservationist, Suriya’s work bridges the gap between Sri Lanka’s cultural history and its unparalleled natural beauty.

His book, Kingdom of Ruhuna, is a testament to his dedication. This masterpiece intricately documents the rich history of Ruhuna, one of Sri Lanka’s ancient kingdoms, while capturing its ecological splendour through vivid photography.

“The Kingdom of Ruhuna is more than just a historical region. It’s a living testament to how culture and nature coexist harmoniously. Through this book, I hope to inspire readers to cherish and protect this symbiosis,” Suriya remarked during an interview with The Island.

The book highlights the majestic landscapes of the Yala National Park, a key area of the Ruhuna Kingdom, showcasing iconic species such as leopards, elephants, and rare birds. Accompanying these visuals is a deep dive into the archaeological remnants of the kingdom, making Kingdom of Ruhuna a unique blend of natural and historical storytelling.

Suriya’s work has not only gained recognition locally but has also reached global audiences. His contributions to events such as In Focus USA, held at UCLA in 2024, emphasise the global importance of Sri Lanka’s wildlife. This exhibition featured Suriya’s photographs of Sri Lanka’s untamed wilderness, which stood out for their ability to bring the raw beauty of nature to life.

“Sri Lanka’s wilderness is a global treasure. Events like these help us connect with the world and highlight the urgent need for conservation,” Suriya noted.

Behind Suriya’s success is a supportive family that shares his love for nature. “My family has always been my backbone, accompanying me on many journeys into the wild. Their encouragement motivates me to keep pushing boundaries,” he shared.

Suriya’s wife and children are frequently seen accompanying him during his explorations, learning about the intricacies of wildlife and the importance of preserving it for future generations. This close-knit family dynamic further adds to the personal charm of his professional journey.

Despite the accolades and achievements, Suriya remains focused on his ultimate goal: conservation. His work goes beyond photography and books; he actively participates in initiatives aimed at educating local communities about the importance of preserving Sri Lanka’s natural heritage.

“The wilderness is not just for us—it belongs to the generations to come. If we don’t act now, we risk losing everything,” Suriya warned passionately.

Through his photographs, books, and global outreach, Suriya is creating a legacy that goes beyond aesthetics. His work serves as both a celebration of Sri Lanka’s biodiversity and a rallying cry for its preservation.

As readers turn the pages of Kingdom of Ruhuna, they are not just witnessing history and beauty—they are becoming part of a movement to protect one of the world’s most precious ecosystems.

Preserving Ruhuna’s Folklore: The timless echoes of Sri Lanka’s Past

Nestled in the heart of Sri Lanka’s southern plains, the Kingdom of Ruhuna is more than just a historical domain—it is a treasure trove of folklore. This ancient realm, steeped in myths and legends, serves as a window into the cultural and spiritual essence of the region. From the timeless tales of warrior kings to whispered stories of mystical beings, Ruhuna’s folklore is a vibrant tapestry that bridges the past and the present.

Ruhuna’s history unfolds like an epic, its roots intertwined with the island’s Buddhist heritage and folklore. It is said that the legendary King Mahanaga, escaping palace intrigues in Anuradhapura, founded the Ruhunu Kingdom in Magama. Oral traditions passed through generations paint vivid pictures of his journey through jungles, rivers, and mountains, accompanied by tales of heroism and resilience.

The region’s lore extends further back, connecting with the mythological era of King Ravana, mentioned in the Ramayana. According to folklore, Ravana’s palaces once adorned the rugged hills of Ruhuna, their remnants lost to time and tide. Fishermen recount sightings of inscriptions on submerged rocks, visible during calm seas—a haunting reminder of this mythical past.

Suriya, reflected on the enduring significance of folklore. “Folklore is the soul of Ruhuna. It is how our ancestors preserved their wisdom, their fears, and their dreams. To lose these stories is to lose a part of who we are,” he explained.

His years of research brought him face-to-face with the oral traditions that animate Ruhuna’s cultural landscape. “Every rock, every tank, every temple tells a story. Even the Yala wilderness, with its leopards and elephants, is a living testament to the harmony our ancestors sought with nature,” he said.

One such story is that of the Nittaewo, a mysterious race believed to have inhabited Ruhuna’s forests. “The Nittaewo are more than just mythical creatures,” Suriya highlighted. “Their story reflects the deep connection our people had with the land, and the battles they fought to survive in a harsh but beautiful environment.”

Folklore has long shaped Ruhuna’s socio-cultural identity, from its agricultural practices to its spiritual traditions. The region’s sacred sites, such as Kataragama, are steeped in stories that blend Buddhist, Hindu, and indigenous beliefs. “Kataragama isn’t just a temple—it’s a narrative crossroads where history and spirituality meet,” he noted.

However, the modern era poses challenges. “Urbanisation, globalisation, and even treasure hunters threaten the survival of these stories,” he warned. “Much of our folklore still exists only in oral form. If we don’t act now, we risk losing it forever.”

Suriya says the book is more than a historical account; it is a call for action. “I wrote Kingdom of Ruhuna to ensure that these stories are not buried in the sands of time,” he added. His work has inspired local efforts to document folklore through schools, community projects, and digital platforms.

For Suriya, preserving folklore is not merely an academic pursuit but a personal mission. “Every tale, whether of kings or villagers, holds a lesson for us today,” he said. “Folklore teaches us to respect our past and to live in harmony with the natural world.”

As Sri Lanka charts its future, Ruhuna’s folklore stands as a reminder of the island’s rich heritage. “Folklore is not just about the past,” he said adding “It’s a guide for the future, teaching us resilience, creativity, and the value of community.”

In conclusion, Suriya expressed his heartfelt gratitude to Prabath Sahabandu, the Editor of The Island newspaper , acknowledging him as the first to publish his research two decades ago.

President Emeritus of the International Institute of Space Law & Policy

The area surrounding the Ruhuna National Park is celebrated in Sinhalese history as a sacred place, steeped in meditation and spiritual significance, where Arahaths have sought refuge. As Nandasiri Jasentuliyana, President Emeritus of the International Institute of Space Law & Policy, observes, even today, the visitor cannot help but feel a sense of sanctity and tranquility in the region, as if stepping into a sacred land rich in history.

He highlights the legend of King Dutugemenu, who, in gratitude to God Skanda (Kataragama Deviyo) for helping him cross the Menik Ganga in his quest to defeat Elara, built a shrine to honour the deity. This shrine, which has remained a holy site for both Hindus and Buddhists, is one of many monuments that underscore the region’s spiritual importance. Tissamaharama and Kiri Wehera stupas are a further testament to the sacredness of the area, which is now home to a wealth of archaeological and religious relics.

Jasentuliyana also draws attention to the Mahavamsa, the ancient Buddhist text, whose final chapter dramatises these historical events, intertwining the sanctity of Ruhuna with the national consciousness of Sri Lanka. The Mahavamsa, written long after the events it narrates, captures the folklore that shapes the region’s history and geography, including that of the Ruhuna Kingdom and the surrounding area.

Despite these rich historical associations, the region is also renowned for its wildlife, particularly in Yala National Park, which boasts the world’s highest population density of leopards. The author, in his unique and insightful style, brings to life the serene beauty and historical richness of the Ruhuna Kingdom, offering readers a scholarly narration enriched by folklores, offering rare glimpses into archaeological sites often overlooked by even historians. As Jasentuliyana concludes, the Ruhuna Kingdom is not only a treasure trove of legendary stories but also a living testament to Sri Lanka’s rich cultural and natural heritage.
