And the event is open to all AIESECers, offering an unparalleled opportunity to refine ethical leadership, foster collaboration, and create positive change. Mark and Comm is its communications and PR partner.

NatCon 2024 will go beyond than just discussions and workshops, to be a vibrant community including international guests and facilitators, gathering for three days of intensive learning and networking. From tailor-made sessions to hands-on training, every moment is crafted to unlock one’s leadership potential. The Gala Night, the grand awarding ceremony, will also celebrate achievements, express gratitude, and honour outstanding contributions to AIESEC in Sri Lanka.

AIESEC encourages individuals to explore a plethora of opportunities beyond their confines, offering a diverse array of experiences aimed at shaping personal and professional journeys, seizing these chances to learn, grow, and enact positive change.

Among the myriad opportunities awaiting exploration beyond NatCon, AIESEC presents three distinct pathways: teaching, interning, and volunteering. With teaching positions available across 29 countries, internships spanning 67 nations, and volunteer projects aligned with the United Nations’ SDGs accessible in 60 countries globally, individuals are afforded the opportunity to broaden their horizons regardless of their background or experience level.
