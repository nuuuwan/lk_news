Sri Lanka to import 70,000 tonnes of rice to address shortage: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will import 70,000 metric tonnes of rice to address a shortfall in the market, Minister of Trade, Commerce, Food Security and Cooperative Development Wasantha Samarasinghe said.

“Even though there was a surplus rice production in the country this year, when you go to the market there is no rice,” Samarasinghe told reporters.

“The best decision we can take in this situation is to import rice to meet the demand.”

The rice will be imported by two state agencies, Sathosa and the State Trading Corporation Samarasinghe said.

Sri Lanka ran out short of parboiled rice (nadu) amid price controls which kept it at the same price as red rice, discouraging growing the variety according to demand, analysts say.

In Sri Lanka import duties are 65 rupees a kilo or about 200 dollars a tonne, compared to around 530 dollars a tonne for similar varieties of rice.
