Semasinghe urges opposition to avoid making false promises on economy ahead of polls

Sri Lanka’s State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe says that any reversal of the hard-earned reforms could result in a catastrophe for the country.

Posting on ‘X’ (formerly Twitter), Semasinghe expressed that as the elections approach, it is concerning to see opposition parties and their main advisors expressing unrealistic views on managing the economy.

“Any reversal of the hard-earned reforms could result in a catastrophe for the country”, he added.

Furthermore, the Finance State Minister also noted that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and international stakeholders have played a pivotal role in reshaping Sri Lanka’s economic landscape, which was in total chaos two years ago.

“I urge all opposition parties and their advisers to avoid making false promises that may not even offer short-term gains but definitely lead to long-term pain”, Semasinghe expressed.

Meanwhile, he also emphasized that it is crucial to prioritize the nation’s economic stability and progress over political games, requesting to engage in responsible discourse and ensure that our economic policies are based on sound and realistic principles, and a design of economic landscape with globally accepted and adopted good practices.
