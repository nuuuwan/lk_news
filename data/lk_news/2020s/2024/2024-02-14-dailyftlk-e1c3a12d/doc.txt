Cabinet nod to amend Online Safety Act

Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena confirms approval of over 20 revisions in Act, refrains from providing specifics

The Cabinet of Ministers approved making several amendments to the recently passed controversial Online Safety Act.

In response to widespread feedback and recommendations from industry experts, the Legal Draftsman has been tasked with crafting the proposed amendments to the Act.

“Since the amendments submitted at the committee sessions in the Parliament with regard to the said draft Bill should be made on par with the decision of the Supreme Court, there had been no opportunity to introduce proposed amendments furnished by the eminencies in the field,” the statement comprising weekly Cabinet decisions issued by the Government Information Department noted.

It also added that having passed the Parliament, the provisions of the Online Security Act are being implemented at present.

Speaking at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena confirmed that over 20 items in the Act were approved on Monday.

However, he refrained from providing specifics regarding the approved revisions and assured that the Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms Minister would brief the media about all pertinent information concerning the Act.

Gunawardena assured that the forthcoming amendments would be guided by the suggestions to ensure the Act aligns with the evolving landscape of online safety and regulation.

The proposal submitted by Public Security Minister Tiran Alles was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers at its meeting on Monday.
