Sri Lanka President meets Indian businessmen: In pictures

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s President Anura Dissanayake, who is on an official visit to India, met with leading Indian business representatives on Monday.

The event was organized by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

Dissanayake highlighted the investor-friendly environment in Sri Lanka and invited Indian entrepreneurs to explore investment opportunities in the country, his media division said.

“The discussion, aimed at strengthening investment and trade relations between the two nations, focused on key areas such as the digital economy, tourism, renewable energy, and information technology.”

Expanding investment opportunities in Sri Lanka by leveraging trade between the two countries was also discussed.

Dissanayake’s party, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, has been extremely critical of Indian involvement in the island in the past, often rallying protests, pickets and boycotts that have led to Indians abandoning projects.

“During the meeting, Indian business leaders expressed their willingness to invest in Sri Lanka, and the Sri Lankan government pledged to provide necessary investment facilitation.”
