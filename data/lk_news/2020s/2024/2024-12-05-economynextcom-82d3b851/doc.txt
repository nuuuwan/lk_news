Sri Lanka leader assures autonomy to BOI, no political favoritism for new investments

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has assured autonomy for the state-run Board of Investment (BOI) in attracting clean investments without any political favoritism, his office said.

Sri Lanka has been lower ranked in ease of doing business due to several layers of red tapes, bribes, and political favoritism in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) in the past.

Government sources have told EconomyNext, the government is in the process of digitizing FDI applications to minimize corruptions and red tapes with some developed nations pledging significant FDI, if the island nation reduces the red tapes and corruption.

President Dissanayake during a discussion held with senior officials of the BOI has said with the political stability after the new government, “an environment suitable for investment has been created”.

“He further emphasized that there will be no political influence in granting new investment opportunities, such as those based on political affiliations,” President’s Media Division said in a statement.

“The President assured that the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka would be granted full autonomy to attract clean investments that are beneficial to the country.”

“He assured that the BOI would be granted full independence to attract investors who can bring meaningful benefits to the nation. Additionally, the President announced that the upcoming budget would prioritize provisions to enhance the BOI’s efficiency. Plans are also underway to establish five new investment zones across the country next year.”

Sri Lanka had been expecting to sign FDI agreements of $3 billion in 2024, but a delay in a refinery to be built by Sinopec of China is likely to reduce that target significantly, a BOI official has said. (Colombo/December 05/2024)
