Online Safety Bill to come into effect from today

Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena has endorsed the Online Safety Bill, and it will be brought into effect as the Online Safety Act No.9 of 2024.

The legislation which seeks to regulate online content was passed in Parliament, with amendments, on 24 January, amidst objections from opposition politicians and activists who allege the new law will muzzle free speech.

The controversial Bill garnered not only the attention of local activists and organisations, but also that of diplomats and large international organisations, claiming that the Bill had numerous problematic aspects.

The Sri Lankan government says the Online Safety Bill, published in the government gazette on 18 September, aims to ban online communication of certain statements in the country, prevent the use of online accounts – both authentic and inauthentic – for the use of prohibited purposes, to suppress the financing and other support of communication of false statements and other related matters.

Additionally, the Speaker endorsed the certificate on National Hydrographic Bill passed on January 9th with amendments and the Contempt of a Court, Tribunal or Institution Bill passed on January 10 with amendments.

These two Bills will come into effect as the National Hydrographic Act. No.7 of 2024 and the Contempt of Court, Tribunal or Institution Act. No.8 of 2024.
