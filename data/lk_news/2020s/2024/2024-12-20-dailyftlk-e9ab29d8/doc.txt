Govt. increases daily allocation for preschool breakfast program

In a move to combat malnutrition among preschool children, the Cabinet of Ministers at their meeting on Wednesday approved increasing the daily allowance for the National Secretariat on Early Child Development’s breakfast program.

The decision raises the per child allocation from Rs. 60 to Rs. 100 reflecting the rising cost of food items.

The program launched in 2017 under the technical guidance of the Health Ministry provides nutritious breakfasts to children in early childhood development centres and preschools with high prevalence of underweight children.

“For 2025, the initiative is expected to benefit around 155,000 children,” Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said.

Addressing the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday, he said the program prioritises preschools with a significant percentage of underweight children. “By directing resources to the most vulnerable, the Government aims to address malnutrition and improve overall health among young learners,” he added.

He also said the increased funding comes in response to the rising cost of essential food items, which has strained the program’s ability to meet nutritional requirements under the Rs. 60 allocation.
