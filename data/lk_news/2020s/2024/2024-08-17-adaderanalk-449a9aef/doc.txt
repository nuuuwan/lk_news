‘Level-3’ landslide early warnings issued for several areas in 2 districts

The National Building and Research Organisation (NBRO) has issued a ‘Level-3’ (Red / Evacuation) landslide early warning for multiple areas in two districts, as heavy rainfall continues in parts of the island.

Accordingly, the Level-3 (Red / Evacuation) warning has been issued for the following divisional secretariat divisions (DSDs) in the Kalutara and Ratnapura districts:

Kalutara – Ingirya and Bulathsinhala divisional secretariat divisions (DSDs) and surrounding areas

Ratnapura - Elapatha, Eheliyagoda and Kalawana DSDs and surrounding areas

The advisory further states that, since rainfall in the aforementioned areas within the past 24 hours has exceeded 150mm, if the rains continue, residents should evacuate to a safe location to avoid the risk of landslides, slope failures, rock falls, cutting failures, and ground subsidence.
