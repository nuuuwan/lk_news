‘Misunderstandings’ in ties with India resolved: Maldives

Maldives Foreign Minister Moosa Zameer acknowledged that Maldives-India ties witnessed rough patches in the initial days of President Mohammad Muizzu-led government, but insisted that the two countries have resolved those “misunderstandings”.

Zameer made the remarks on Friday during a visit to Sri Lanka, where he stressed the importance of the Indian Ocean archipelago’s relationships with key allies, particularly China and India.

He said relations with India had faced challenges, particularly following Muizzu’s campaign to remove a small contingent of Indian troops from the Maldives. Zameer said the “misunderstandings” had been resolved following the repatriation of Indian troops. “(We) have good relations with both China and India, and both countries continue to support Maldives.”
