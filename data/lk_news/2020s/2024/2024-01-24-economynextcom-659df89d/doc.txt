Sri Lanka parliament passes online speech law despite opposition

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Parliament passed a controversial Online Safety Bill on Wednesday.

Legislators had passionately argued for and against the proposed law over two days.

Rights groups and international technology groups had expressed concerns about the law saying that it will stifle freedom of speech on the internet.

The bill, along with a new counter-terror law have drawn criticism from various quarters including civil society.

Meanwhile, around 71.6 percent of the Sri Lankan public are unaware of the Online Safety Bill, a CPA survey found. (Colombo/Jan24/2024)
