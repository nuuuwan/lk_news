Sri Lanka calls competitive tender for 50MW Mannar plant with bird radar

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s state-run Ceylon Electricity Board has called a competitive tender from private developers to build a 50 Mega Watt wind power plant, adjacent to an existing wind farm build by the utility.

The investor will have to build a Radar Based Bird Collision Avoidance (RBBCA) system.

Mannar is on a key bird migratory route (flyway) where birds come to the island around the third quarter of the year and leave at the end of the first quarter.

The radars will detect any incoming flocks towards the blades and shut down the turbines.

Mannar is estimated to have high plant factor of around 45 percent or more. (Colombo/Mar19/2024)
