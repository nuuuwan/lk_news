Showers expected in parts of the island

The Meteorology Department says showers will occur at times in Eastern and Uva provinces and in Polonnaruwa, Matale and Nuwara-Eliya districts.

A few showers may occur in Anuradhapura, Mullaitivu and Hambantota districts, it said.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at few places in Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces and in Galle, Matara and Kandy districts after 2.00 p.m.

Fairly strong winds about 40 kmph can be expected at times over the Northern, North-central, Eastern, Central, Uva and Northwestern provinces and Hambantota district.

The public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
