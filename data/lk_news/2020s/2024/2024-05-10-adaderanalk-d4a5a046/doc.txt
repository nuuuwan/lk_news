Public assistance sought to gather info on Sri Lankan military veterans fighting in Russia-Ukraine war

The Sri Lankan military veterans, who had illegally joined Russian mercenaries and subsequently escaped from such groups in the conflict zones to returned to the island, claim that around 1,000 Sri Lankans are currently fighting in the Ukraine –Russia warfront.

However, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) pointed out that the relevant figures cannot be confirmed, since the investigations are still underway regarding the identities of these individuals.

Against this backdrop, ASP of the CID’s Human Trafficking, Smuggling, and Maritime Crimes Division, Harendra Jayakantha urged the relatives of the individuals who have left the country to join the Russian army, to provide information regarding them through the contact number, 071-8592831.

Following the investigations by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), it has only been confirmed that 114 Sri Lankan soldiers and ex-soldiers have left the country to join the Ukrainian army.

Further, the police revealed that investigations have shown that 60 Sri Lankans have been sent to Russia and 23 Sri Lankans have been sent to Ukraine so far by human traffickers, to be deployed in the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

Joining Ada Derana’s current affairs programme “Big Focus” on Thursday (9), ASP Harendra Jayakantha said investigations have revealed that over 100 members of Sri Lankan security forces have joined the Russia – Ukraine war front by illegal means.

Meanwhile, investigations carried out so far have revealed that six Sri Lankans sent to Russia by human traffickers to join the military have been killed.

Two other Sri Lankans who joined Ukrainian forces by illegal means have also been confirmed dead, the police said.

In the meantime, the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) has arrested a retired Major General and a Sergeant in the Lake Round area in Kurunegala on suspicion of illegally sending Sri Lankans for employment in the Russian army.

Extensive investigations have been conducted by the police into the activities of the retired Major General in question, who was implicated in the operation.

During the course of the investigation, it was discovered that he had allegedly accessed a list of names of retired army officers from the Army Headquarters.

Authorities are currently continuously pursuing leads related to the trafficking of former Sri Lankan military personnel to mercenary camps both in Russia and Ukraine.
