SJB will support amended IMF program: Harsha

Main opposition, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Dr. Harsha de Silva yesterday said that they will support an amended International Monetary Fund (IMF) program for Sri Lanka.

Dr. de Silva made this announcement following a constructive discussion with notable economists and policymakers, including Jayati Ghosh, Martin Guzman and Charles Abugre, alongside fellow SJB member Kabir Hashim.

“Good conversation with @Jayati1609 @Martin_M_Guzman @CharlesAbugre w @KabirHashim4 on purported alternative to @IMFNews. Agree nations must cooperate to increase bargaining position but won’t blame conspiracy for SriLanka crisis. @sjbsrilanka will stay w amended IMF program,” Dr. de Silva posted on ‘X’.

He pointed out the importance of international cooperation to enhance bargaining positions but rejected conspiracy theories as explanations for Sri Lanka’s economic crisis.

Dr. de Silva’s statement underscores the party’s pragmatic approach to addressing the country’s financial challenges through the IMF’s framework, albeit with necessary amendments to better suit national interests.
