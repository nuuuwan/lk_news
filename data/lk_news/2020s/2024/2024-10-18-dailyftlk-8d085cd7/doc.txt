On 14 October, the tech world took notice as Samsung Sri Lanka and Singhagiri announced their spectacular flagship showroom at R.A. De Mel Mawatha.

This launch is such a bold statement about the enduring partnership between these two industry giants, which has thrived for over 40 years within Singhagiri’s impressive 52-year legacy. The showroom is packed with cutting-edge technology and home appliances from global brands like Hisense, Candy, HP, Lenovo, Realme, and Oppo, promising a thrilling experience for customers eager to explore the latest innovations.

The grand opening was a star-studded affair, attended by influential figures of Singhagiri Ltd., such as Directors Anusha Marasinghe, Nasser Majeed and Chathurika De Silva, and CEO Lasantha Alwis. Samsung Sri Lanka was represented by key executives including Managing Director SangHwa Song and Director of Consumer Electronics Business Sabry Anwar.

Founded in 1972 by Sugathadasa Marasinghe, Singhagiri has become synonymous with trust in Sri Lanka’s consumer electronics scene. Through thick and thin, Singhagiri has championed Samsung since introducing the brand in 1983, turning it into a household name and a preferred choice for consumers. This new showroom isn’t just a continuation of that legacy; it’s a dynamic leap forward, allowing Singhagiri to bring Samsung’s game-changing technology to even more homes across the island.

“The flagship showroom at Kiribathgoda is designed to elevate the retail experience, letting customers interact with Samsung’s latest offerings directly. This aligns perfectly with our strategy to fortify our footprint in key urban centres and improve customer access,” stated Anwar. The new space will not only feature the latest devices but will also host interactive displays and dedicated zones for hands-on experiences, ensuring customers can engage deeply with the products.

The Singhagiri Plaza flagship showroom is more than a retail space; it’s an innovative hub for consumers eager to dive into the latest tech — from smartphones to smart home devices. The showroom’s design embraces modern aesthetics while focusing on customer engagement. With interactive stations, augmented reality experiences, and expert staff available for demonstrations, customers will have the opportunity to explore the full capabilities of Samsung’s technology.

With a network of retail locations and service centres expanding across Sri Lanka, Singhagiri aims to ensure that customers everywhere can access premium Samsung products and unparalleled services. “Our mission is to make Samsung’s top-tier products and services readily available to every corner of Sri Lanka. This showroom launch is a significant stride in making that vision a reality,” remarked Alwis. The showroom will also provide after-sales support and customer service, reinforcing Singhagiri’s commitment to excellence.

As Singhagiri continues to push boundaries and explore new avenues, the launch of this flagship showroom marks another major milestone on its journey as a frontrunner in consumer electronics. The introduction of the SGL product line has also been a game-changer, attracting positive attention and further enriching Singhagiri’s diverse offerings. This flagship showroom not only symbolises the company’s growth but also underscores its true commitment to delivering top-notch technology and outstanding service at competitive prices.

In the coming months, Singhagiri plans to introduce exclusive events, product launches, and workshops at the showroom, positioning it as a community hub for tech enthusiasts. “We’re not just opening a store; we’re creating a space where technology meets lifestyle, and customers can immerse themselves in the future of electronics,” said Anusha Marasinghe.

With their partnership gaining momentum, Samsung and Singhagiri are set to transform the consumer electronics landscape in Sri Lanka, ensuring Singhagiri remains the ultimate destination for all tech enthusiasts. As they celebrate this new chapter, both companies are excited about the potential to elevate the customer experience and drive innovation in the industry.
