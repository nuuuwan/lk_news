Nagananda seeks to challenge NPP’s registration before courts

One time Presidential hopeful and Secretary of the Vinivida Front Attorney Nagananda Kodituwakku filed a motion before the Supreme Court yesterday seeking an opportunity to present facts to prove that the registration of the National People’s Power (NPP) party is illegal.

According to sources, Kodituwakku has filed the motion concerning the writ petition filed by him against the decision by the Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL) to reject the party registration application submitted by the front.

In his motion, Nagananda maintains that the registration of the NPP, a part of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) as a political party contravenes the law. According to him, it is against the law to register offshoots of the same party as separate political parties and it violates constitutional rights which assures a free and fair election.

Accordingly, he has now requested leave from the courts through the motion to present facts relating to the claim. Kodituwakku is a vehement critic of the NPP and is known for his online tirades against the party.
