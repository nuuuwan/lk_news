The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world’s largest charitable foundations, has agreed to establish a Program Support Unit to support the Office of the President of Sri Lanka.

Accordingly, Global Health Strategies, an international organization established by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and its local partner Connect to Care Organization, have agreed to establish a Program Support Unit to support the President’s Office in relation to these programs and to act as partners providing active contributions to the Government of Sri Lanka.

As such, an Executive Committee consisting of senior officials will be appointed to ensure proper coordination for the proper implementation of the various programs being implemented by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Upon consideration of the matters presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe regarding the policy support proposed to be provided by the Foundation to the Presidential Secretariat, the Cabinet of Ministers on Monday (29 Jan.) approved for the necessary measures to be taken in this regard.

The Office of the President plays an important role in the ongoing reform programs by providing guidance on policy issues and monitoring government programs, the statement said.

For this purpose, the President’s Office maintains coordination with a number of multi-stakeholder organizations such as International Monetary Fund’s Comprehensive Funding Facility, World Bank’s Development Policy Operational Program, Asian Development Bank’s Policy Assistance Programs, etc. and interacts with various public and private sector stakeholders, it said.
