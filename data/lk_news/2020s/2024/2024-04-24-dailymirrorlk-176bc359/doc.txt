Karapitiya Hospital gets new CT scanner

April 24, (Daily Mirror)  -  The Galle Karapitiya Teaching Hospital unveiled its latest addition of a cutting-edge CT Scanner valued at Rs 250 million.

The installation ceremony, held today (24), was spearheaded by Minister of Health and Industry, Dr. Ramesh Pathirana.

This state-of-the-art CT Scanner, manufactured in Japan, marks a substantial upgrade to the hospital's diagnostic facilities.

Following its installation last Sunday, patients can now benefit from CT Scan tests, with the hospital poised to conduct 40 to 50 scans daily, significantly alleviating the backlog of cases awaiting diagnostic imaging.
