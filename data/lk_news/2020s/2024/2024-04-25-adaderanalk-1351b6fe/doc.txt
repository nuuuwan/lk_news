Duminda Dissanayake appointed SLFP’s Acting General Secretary

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party’s (SLFP) faction led by Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva has appointed MP Duminda Dissanayake as the party’s Acting General Secretary.

He was appointed during the politburo meeting convened by the faction backing Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva this evening (25).

On Wednesday (24), the Colombo District Court issued an injunction preventing MP Sarathie Dushmantha Mithrapala from functioning as the General Secretary of SLFP and implementation of the decisions taken by him as the SLFP Acting General Secretary.

It was mentioned in the order that these injunctions will remain in effect until May 08, 2024.

These injunctions were issued after considering a plaint submitted by Ministers Mahinda Amaraweera, Lasantha Alagiyawanna and Member of Parliament Duminda Dissanayake.
