Navy sailor dies from injuries during arrest of Indian fishermen off Delft

Sri Lanka Navy has taken into custody 10 Indian fishermen in a trawler while poaching in seas off Delft Island.

A sailor who was injured during the incident has succumbed to his injuries after admission to hospital, the Sri Lanka Navy Spokesman said.

The Navy says it continues to conduct regular patrols and operations in Sri Lankan waters to curb illegal fishing practices of foreign fishing trawlers, taking into account the impact of those practices on the livelihood of local fishermen.

Sri Lanka Navy has arrested over 200 Indian fishermen and seized more than 27 Indian poaching trawlers in Sri Lankan waters so far in 2024, and subsequently handed them over to authorities for legal proceedings.
