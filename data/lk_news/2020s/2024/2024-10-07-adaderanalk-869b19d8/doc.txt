The former Senior DIG and head of the SIS, Nilantha Jayawardana, appeared before the Supreme Court this morning in relation to the contempt of court charges filed against him, for failing to complete the payment of Rs. 75 million in compensation for the Easter Sunday bomb victims as ordered by the court.

The relevant case was taken up before a seven-member Supreme Court judge bench led by Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya this morning, whereas the case was adjourned until 1.30 p.m. as President’s Counsel Chandaka Jayasundara, who appeared for defendant  Jayawardena stated before the court that since his client is an active duty police officer, he is not in a position to demand money from outside parties for payment of the compensation.

President’s Counsel further informed that however, the taking into account the situation, Jayawardena’s friends have come forward to help paying the rest of the compensation that is to be paid and that the relevant amount will be settled to the Office for Reparations through the bank today.

Later when the case was taken up again this afternoon, the Additional Solicitor General who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General informed the court that the Office for Reparations had reported that Jayawardena has settled the remaining Rs. 65 million.

During the trial, defendant Nilantha Jayawardena apologized to the court for the delay in paying the relevant compensation. Later, the case was ordered to be recalled on November 18.
