Five Exciting New Categories from Mackly and SEDA

Founded in 2017, Mackly, the premier sleep and loungewear brand that caters to both kids and moms, is synonymous with passion, vision, and dedication. It has quickly become a powerhouse in the industry, opening its flagship retail store at the One Galle Face Mall in 2021.

Sharmila Srikumar, the founder, is a visionary entrepreneur and devoted mother of three daughters. Mackly originated from Sharmila’s personal quest for the perfect pajamas for her children. Baby Clan, a sub-brand at Mackly, offers newborn essentials extending up to the age of two. Renowned for its 100% breathable cotton material, Mackly Sleepwear undergoes meticulous testing for safety, comfort, and style. Srikumar emphasizes, “We run world-class quality checks on our products related to wearability factors and root out the presence of harmful chemicals such as phthalates.”

Mackly was initially conceived as a mother and child sleepwear brand, but due to overwhelming consumer demand, the brand evolved to include exciting new collections for teens, women, and men.

Today, Mackly and SEDA stand as a testament to Sharmila’s creative focus, entrepreneurial spirit, and unwavering commitment to quality.

Sharmila has expanded her brand portfolio with the introduction of SEDA, targeting both teens and adults. This expansion includes new categories such as SEADA Teens, SEDA Innerwear, and SEDA Black Active.

Additionally, SEDA introduces a luxurious wedding collection, epitomizing elegance with satin and lace, offering premium options for brides on their special day.

In response to today’s active lifestyles, SEDA unveils SEDA Black Active, showcasing high-performance activewear with sleek designs and advanced fabric technology for optimal comfort and performance during workouts and outdoor activities.

Meanwhile, Mackly has introduced Kids Active, an environmentally conscious line of activewear for children, featuring vibrant sports bras, colorful prints, and essential silhouettes tailored for various activities like sports that involve dynamic movements, agility, and physical exertion, requiring specialized clothing that support athletes’ performance and comfort during play such as football, tennis, and basketball.
