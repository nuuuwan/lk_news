Renewed crisis grips ‘Suwa Seriya’ ambulance service, claims Sajith

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa alleged that 56 out of the 322 ambulances belonging to the ‘1990’ ‘Suwa Seriya’ free ambulance service are now out of service.

Speaking during today’s (14) Parliamentary session, Premadasa urged the government to take immediate action to safeguard the ‘Suwa Seriya’ Ambulance Service from collapse.

He further highlighted that a significant number of ‘Suwa Seriya’ ambulance drivers and Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) have departed the country, leading to prolonged periods required for training replacements.

Additionally, only a limited number of individuals have shown interest in joining the ‘Suwa Seriya’ service, the Opposition Leader stressed.

“In fact, adequate attention and support from the government has not been received for the repair of these ambulances and addressing their deficiencies. Therefore, I urge the government to intervene to maintain and protect this ‘Suwa Seriya’ service”, Premadasa further stated.
