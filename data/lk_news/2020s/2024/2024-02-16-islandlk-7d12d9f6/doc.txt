“Our journey of content creating as a couple began actually by teasing each other. We would both get ideas based on funny habits or patterns we noticed in each other and realize how relatable it was to talk about these things! On camera, everything is dramatized, but most of the videos are inspired by real life conversations, thoughts or events.”
