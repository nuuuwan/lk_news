Shavendra advises Sri Lankan veterans to avoid mercenary service abroad

Colombo, May 8 (Daily Mirror) - In light of emerging reports detailing the involvement of Sri Lankan veterans in foreign mercenary forces, Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Shavendra Silva has issued a heartfelt plea to his fellow veterans, urging them to resist the allure of mercenary service.

“These veterans, once the pride of our nation, have succumbed to the seductive promises of riches and adventure, forsaking the values that define us as warriors and patriots,” General Silva said in a statement yesterday.

He also stated that as members of the Armed Forces of Sri Lanka, “we are bound by duty, honour, and a deep sense of loyalty to our motherland. We have stood valiantly in the face of adversity, sacrificing for the greater good of our nation. Yet, there are whispers of temptation, enticing some of our comrades to forsake their loyalty for the allure of easy money and transient glory.”

“Our bravery is not a commodity to be traded for personal gain; it is a testament to our unwavering commitment to the protection and prosperity of our homeland.”

He also said; Mercenary warfare is not a noble pursuit; it is a path fraught with peril and moral ambiguity. Those who choose to walk this path risk tarnishing the reputation of our esteemed military. As members of a victorious military who defeated the most ruthless terrorist organisation in the world, we must uphold the honour and integrity of our profession".
