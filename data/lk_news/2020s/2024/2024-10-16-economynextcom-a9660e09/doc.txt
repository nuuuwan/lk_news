Sri Lanka should focus on debt restructure, legal challenge by Hamilton Reserve: former minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s focus now should be on implementing the debt restructuring process, particularly in response to the legal challenge by the Hamilton Reserve Bank, the former State Finance Minister has said.

It was encouraging to see the new administration continuing former President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s proven economic policies, despite heavy criticism from the current government while in opposition, Shehan Semasinghe said on X.

“The focus now is on effectively implementing the debt restructuring process, particularly in response to the legal challenge by the Hamilton Reserve Bank,” Semasinghe said in response to media reports on the case.

In March, Sri Lanka sought a 5-month extension in the suspension of a case filed by Hamilton Reserve, a holdout investor who is seeking immediate payment on a defaulted bond series in which it claims a 25 percent stake.

Sri Lanka had sought the extension of a six-month extension given by a New York court, to conclude restructuring negotiations with bondholders, having got an in-principle deal with official creditors.

Hamilton Reserve had objected saying Sri Lanka was not keeping it informed of the progress of discussions with bondholders, Bloomberg Newswires reported. (Colombo/Oct16/2024)
