43 hectares of land in Trincomalee Port allocated for 20MW solar power project

The Sri Lanka Ports Authority has allocated 43 hectares of land in Kappalthure, Trincomalee, for a 20-megawatt solar power project. This initiative supports the national goal of increasing the country’s renewable energy to 70% by 2030. The land, leased for thirty years, is expected to generate an income of 1.75 million rupees per month.

The agreement was signed between the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and the “Sun Scape” Project Company, a subsidiary of the Sri Lankan firm “Selex Renewables,” on July 24, at the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation Auditorium.

After signing this agreement, Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva stated:

“The National Energy Policy of the current government has accepted that renewable energy should be produced as a solution to the electricity crisis in Sri Lanka.

Accordingly, by the year 2030, 70% of the energy required by Sri Lanka is expected to be obtained from renewable sources. Under this programme, 43 hectares of unproductive land in the Kappalthura area owned by the Trincomalee Port has been given to a Sri Lankan company on a thirty-year lease basis, which will generate an income of 1.75 million rupees per month to the Port Authority which will thus make a special contribution to the national economy in addition to generating solar power.”
