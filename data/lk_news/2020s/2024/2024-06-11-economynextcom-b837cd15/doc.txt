Sri Lanka to promote sea cucumber hatcheries due to demand: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will establish more sea cucumber hatcheries to accommodate growing demand for the marine animal in the export market, Minister of Fisheries Douglas Devananda said.

“There are three hatcheries established in Jaffna peninsula. Very soon we will establish in the other areas,” Devananda told reporters on Tuesday.

“They are like black gold,” Devananda said. There are “a lot of farms, especially in the Northern Province. We are getting foreign exchange too.”

The invertebrate found on the sea floor is not commonly consumed by Sri Lankans, so they are being exported to countries like China, Devananda said.

“Sea cucumber, especially our people, they are not eating, it is in China, they are eating.”

Last year the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources told EconomyNext that a kilo of sea cucumber is valued at 20,000-30,000 rupees.

Devananda proposed the establishment of hatcheries as an alternative to catching wild sea cucumbers. (Colombo/Jun11/2024)
