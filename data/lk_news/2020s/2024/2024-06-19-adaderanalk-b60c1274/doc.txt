Teachers to launch ‘sick leave’ trade union action

The Ceylon Teachers’ Union (CTU) says they have decided to engage in trade union action by reporting sick on June 26 (Wednesday).

The CTU General Secretary, Joseph Stalin, stated that if their demands are not met as promised, the teachers will also withdraw from the Ordinary Level (O/L) exam paper marking activities.

However, Minister of Education Susil Premajayantha, speaking at a ceremony held yesterday (18), stated that students today are fulfilling their academic needs despite the trade union actions of the teachers.

Meanwhile, the University Trade Union Joint Committee (UTUJC) stated that the discussions held with the University Grants Commission (UGC) regarding their wage issues were positive.

UTUJC co-chairman Dhammika Priyantha emphasized that authorities will be given a week to provide necessary solutions to the wage disparities.

Additionally, he announced that a ‘Sathyagraha’ campaign will be launched in front of universities from today (19), and that if no solutions are received, the Sathyagraha will be brought to Colombo.
