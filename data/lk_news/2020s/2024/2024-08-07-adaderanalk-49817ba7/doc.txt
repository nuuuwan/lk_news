ACMC to announce decision on presidential candidate next week

The All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) led by former minister Rishad Bathiudeen has decided to announce the candidate it will support in the upcoming presidential election on August 14.

The leader of the ACMC, MP Rishad Bathiudeen, stated that this decision was taken during the party’s Supreme Council meeting last night.

“The Supreme Council of our party held an extensive discussion regarding who we should support in the presidential election. Accordingly, we have decided to reach a final decision at 10 a.m. on the 14th.”

He stated that since the ACMC is still in the ‘Samagi Jana Sandanaya’, they will participate in the alliance’s meetings.

“At that time, the SJB has requested to give our support to the party. Meanwhile, the current President has also sent us a letter requesting for our support. What we are saying is that we need to protect the current economy. We can’t go back in reverse gear”, he said.
