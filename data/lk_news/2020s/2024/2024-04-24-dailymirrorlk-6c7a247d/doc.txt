Tourists ride on footboards of express trains

Railway passengers on the upcountry mainline expressed concern over the accidents involving foreign tourists riding on footboards of the express trains.

They pointed out that tourists are in the habit of riding on footboards and taking selfies regardless of their danger, and that several accidents, some of which were fatal, had occurred recently.

In the latest incident, a foreign woman fell down the Podi Minike Express on Sunday (21) near the Ohiya railway station, and in a similar incident about a month ago, an Iranian tourist received serious injuries.

Passengers pointed out that the railway guards and the security service officials should take steps to prevent tourists from taking this risky journey.
