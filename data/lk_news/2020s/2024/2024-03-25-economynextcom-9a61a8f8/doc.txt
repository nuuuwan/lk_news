Sri Lanka to criminalize marital rape: Justice Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka aims to introduce a bill that would criminalize marital rape, Minister of Justice, Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa said.

“Under the law, spouses can only claim that their husband raped them when there is a separation order,” Rajapaksa said. “However, we plan to introduce a bill that would criminalize rape by one’s husband.”

Under the current law, marriage without judicial separation is recognized as an exemption to rape under 363 of the Penal Code.

A 2020 study conducted by the UNFPA found that 9.5 per cent of Sri Lankan men had perpetrated sexual violence against their intimate female partners while 6.7 per cent have caused both physical and sexual violence.

Sri Lanka’s current laws also fail to recognize a male as a victim of rape and a female as a perpetrator.

“We want to gender neutralize this,” Rajajapaksha said. “So that men can be recognized as victims and women as perpetrators.” (Colombo/Mar25/2024)
