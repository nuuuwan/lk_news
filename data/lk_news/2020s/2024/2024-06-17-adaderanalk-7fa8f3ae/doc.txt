Water supply to several areas disrupted due to damaged pipeline

The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWS&DB) says that the water supply in Godagama, Homagama, Pannipitiya, Pelanwatta, Rukmalgama and Mattegoda areas have been interrupted until further notice.

The water supply to these areas has been interrupted due to a damage in the transmission pipeline from the Kalatuwawa Treatment Plant.

According to reports, the water transmission pipeline from the Kalatuwawa Treatment Plant has burst at Godagama near the High-Level Road owing to a vehicular accident.

A car had veered off the road and collided with the water transmission pipeline this morning (17) causing severe damage to the pipeline.

Piyal Rajapaksa, the Operations Manager of the Kalatuwawa Reservoir in Labugama, has indicated that repairs are expected to be completed and the water supply restored by this evening.

As a result of the incident, the water supply to over 100,000 housing units in the affected areas has been interrupted until further notice.
