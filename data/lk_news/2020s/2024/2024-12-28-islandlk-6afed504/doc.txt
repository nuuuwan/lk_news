CIPM first to offer NVQ equivalent HRM courses in Sri Lanka

CIPM’s Diploma in Professional HRM (CQHRM Level 2) and Diploma in HRM (PQHRM Managerial Level) have been recognised as NVQ Level 5 qualifications by the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC). This landmark achievement was formalised in December 2024 with the signing of an official declaration between CIPM and TVEC.

The NVQ equivalence applies to students who completed the Diploma in Professional HRM from 2020 onwards and the Diploma in HRM from 2016 onwards. This ensures that both current and past students can benefit from nationally recognized qualifications. The move underscores CIPM’s commitment to enhancing the value and relevance of its programs within Sri Lanka’s National Qualifications Framework.

This achievement enhances CIPM’s academic reputation, offering students nationally recognised qualifications and solidifying its role as a leader in HRM education in Sri Lanka. It reflects CIPM’s dedication to meeting industry standards while supporting the professional growth of HRM practitioners.
