Sri Lanka to have pricing formula for water: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – A water price formula will be prepared in consultation with the advisors of the National Water Supply Board and the Asian Development Bank, Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development Minister Jeevan Thondaman said.

“A price formula will be introduced for water charges, that can reduce the water charges along with lowering the electricity bill,” Thondaman was quoted as saying in a statement by the Government Department of Information.

Thondaman was speaking at a discussion held at the Peradeniya University Institute of Water Research and Technology.

Last week, the National Steering Committee on Water Sector Reforms met today to finalise several key policies and guidelines in the water sector.

“We are ready to present to the public, for their feedback, Sri Lanka’s new national policies on Drinking Water and Water Safety, as well as new Guidelines on Water Supply Connections,” Thondaman said on X.

“Our aim is to ensure a safe, affordable and reliable water supply for all under a consistent and clear framework.”

The new policies and guidelines are part of the US$ 200 million ADB supported reforms in the water sector.

Thondaman said the goal of the reforms was to create a more sustainable water sector in Sri Lanka that is both climate and consumer conscious. (Colombo/Jan15/2024)
