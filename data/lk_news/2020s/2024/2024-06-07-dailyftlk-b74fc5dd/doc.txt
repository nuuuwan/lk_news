The Government has decided to provide Rs. 10,000 each for the families affected by floods in order to clean up their houses, State Minister of Defence Premitha Bandara Tennakoon said.

The Government has primarily allocated an amount of around Rs. 150 million for this purpose, and the relevant funds will be provided to the district secretaries, the State Minister expressed.
