Sri Lanka seeks wider cooperation with BIMSTEC partners

ECONOMYNEXT – ASEAN countries have potential to expand intra-regional trade relations by signing more free trade agreements, State Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe has said.

“Regional free trade agreements play a critical role in implementing an institutional framework that provides a stable operating environment for the success of trade and investment,” Semasinghe told a BIMSTEC discussion held on the sidelines of the Raisina Dialogue 2024 in New Delhi, this week.

An agreement to create a framework for a free trade agreement for BIMSTEC was agreed 20 years ago in 2004, but no progress has been made in implementing this, Semasinghe noted in a facebook post.

Several BIMSTEC countries have bilateral trade agreements, such as Sri Lanka and India, Thailand and Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand, but no collective regional agreement to enable intra-regional leverage, Semasinghe pointed out.

“Such an agreement, which strikes a balance between trade potential and protection of vulnerable sectors, could boost intra-regional trade as well as trade between BIMSTEC and the rest of the world.”

Due to the current high global interest rates, there was a huge financial need to fund long-term investment needs in energy, infrastructure and climate mitigation, Semasinghe told representatives of Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and India.
