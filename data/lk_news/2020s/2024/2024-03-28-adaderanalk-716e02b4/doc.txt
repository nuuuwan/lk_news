NCPA to work with UK-based global charity to remove online content of child sexual abuse

A new method will be introduced starting Thursday (28) to submit complaints concerning any online records of child sexual abuse, the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) says.

According to NCPA chairman Senior Lecturer Udayakumara Amarasinghe, the complaints can now be lodged online via the official website of the regulatory government authority responsible for the protection of children.

The complaints received by the NCPA will be directly reported to the UK-based Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), a global charity working to hunt down and remove videos and images of child sexual abuse shared online.

Each report received by the IWF will subsequently be manually assessed by its highly trained analysts and necessary measures will be taken to remove online images and videos of child sexual abuse victims.

The IWF says when it traces the content to being hosted in other countries, it is reported to the UK National Crime Agency (NCA) which will then forward it to INTERPOL, the international police organisation, so they can pass it on to the hosting countryâ€™s police.
