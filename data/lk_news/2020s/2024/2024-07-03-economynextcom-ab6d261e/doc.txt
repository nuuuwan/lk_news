Sri Lanka to enlist help of army, navy for deep-sea diving tourists

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is planning to enlist the help of the military to help boost deep-sea diving for tourists, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, Chalaka Gajabahu said.

“We are talking to the associations in that area and we also plan on enlisting the help of the Army and Navy,” Gajabahu told EconomyNext on 2nd July.

“We plan on focusing on water sports such as surfing and diving.”

Sri Lanka has several diving centres including in Unawatuna and Hikkaduwa.

In addition to coral eco-systems near-shore, Sri Lanka has a large number of wrecks around the island, some dating back centuries.

The National Shipwreck Database of Sri Lanka lists 114 shipwrecks, with the oldest dating back to 2nd century BCE.

Tourism Minister Harin Fernando said authorities also want to boost yacht ownership and yacht based tourism.
