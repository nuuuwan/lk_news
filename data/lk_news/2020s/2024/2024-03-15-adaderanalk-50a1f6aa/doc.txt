Harsha denies requesting meeting with IMF, says ‘Don’t play politics with our economy’

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Dr. Harsha de Silva has refuted recent claims that he requested for a meeting with the visiting delegation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Taking to ‘X’ (formerly Twitter) in response to a statement made by State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe, the SJB MP stated that he had merely requested for the Opposition to be involved in the External Debt Restructure (EDR).

MP Dr. Harsha de Silva further highlighted that he had made a request in this regard given the crucial importance of the Opposition being made aware of such facts and figures in the event they are elected as the next government.

“Never requested an IMF meeting (deal finalized). My request: Opposition involved in EDR (crucial for when we take over next Govt.)I have never reneged my responsibility and continue to work for #lka, even in Opp. Don’t play politics with our economy”, the MP’s statement on ‘X’ read.

On Thursday night (14 March), State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe revealed that the government is ready to discuss with the Opposition the progress of the discussions with Sri Lanka’s creditors and the programme of the IMF.

In a statement on ‘X’, Semasinghe revealed that as per the request made by MP Dr. Harsha de Silva, the government is willing to provide any additional information in this regard, however, he added that they “will not be able to disclose any market sensitive information”.

“Although the opposition deliberately missed out the discussion facilitated with good faith on alternative proposals including debt restructuring, the government is once again ready to facilitate another opportunity”, Semasinghe said, emphasizing the importance for the opposition too, to act in good faith.
