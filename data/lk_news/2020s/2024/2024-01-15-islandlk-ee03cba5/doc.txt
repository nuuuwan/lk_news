Yohani…doing it with Waves

Yohani de Silva, who came into the spotlight with her remake of ‘Manike Mage Hithe,’ released her very first album, ‘Kella,’ in December, 2023.

‘Kella’ contains 14 tracks, including three songs in English – ‘Submerged,’ ‘Free To Love’ and ‘Cold Sunday.’

Coinciding with the dawn of 2024, Waves, a local brand of footwear, challenged 50 influencers to dance to Yohani’s newest hit single, ‘Kella,’ at the Waves concept store and pick up a new pair of Waves for the new year.

Adding colour to the challenge, Yohani surprised fans at the Waves concept store and took time to interact with her fans.
