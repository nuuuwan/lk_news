Phew! With temperatures soaring high, the dreaded heat can certainly create problems for our skin, too.

Quite a few readers have indicated to me that they are having a tough time with this heat, with plenty of heat pimples cropping up.

The following skincare routine can help keep your skin stay fresh and hydrated during this scorching hot period…

Lemon juice is a reliable remedy to reduce heat pimples on the face, naturally. Mix a teaspoon of lemon juice with honey and dab the mixture on the pimples with a cotton ball. Let it stay on the pimples for five minutes and then wash off with cold water. Doing this daily will prevent heat pimples from forming.

Apply honey on the heat pimples directly and let it dry. Leave it on for at least 30 minutes and then wash your face. You can repeat this 02-03 times daily.

One of the major skin issues most of us face during the heat is sun tan and the effective ways to get rid of tanning and pigmentation is by applying natural face masks. Watermelon is packed with vitamins A and C, which are essential for healthy and youthful skin. Mix equal parts of honey and cold watermelon juice. Apply it on your face and neck and watch your tan disappear!

Keep your skin healthy and hydrated in this scorching heat by moisturizing it with a natural aloe-based cream. Mix fresh aloe vera gel with almond and coconut oil, and your homemade cream or serum is ready! Use this daily for best results and your skin will stay supple and hydrated.

A papaya-based cleanser helps in reducing acne and removing dead skin. To make this natural cleanser at home, mix three tablespoons of papaya pulp, one tablespoon of lemon juice, and one tablespoon of honey until you get a smooth paste. Apply it to your face and neck, leave it on for 20 minutes, and then rinse it off with cold water. If you have sensitive skin, you can even dilute lemon juice with water and do a patch test first. If lemon isn’t suitable for your skin, you can replace it with tomato pulp.

By the way, what you eat also shows on your skin. Therefore, you should consume a balanced diet rich in seasonal fruits and veggies when it’s hot, hot, hot. Additionally, you should keep yourself hydrated with cooling beverages, like lemonade, coconut water, etc. At the same time, indulge in pampering skincare sessions at home.
