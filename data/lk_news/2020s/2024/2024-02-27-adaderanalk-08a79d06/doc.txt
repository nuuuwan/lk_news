Mutukumarana to fill MP seat vacated by Premarathne

S. C. Mutukumarana is tipped to fill the vacancy in parliament created after the resignation of MP Uddika Premarathne earlier today (Feb.27).

The Anuradhapura District parliamentarian stepped down from his post for reasons yet to be made public.

Premarathne has thus submitted his letter of resignation to the Deputy General Secretary of Parliament Mr. Chaminda Kularatne.

Accordingly, Mutukumarana is reportedly next in line on the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) list for the Anuradhapura District.
