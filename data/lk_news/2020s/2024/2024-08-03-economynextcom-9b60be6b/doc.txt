Sri Lanka fights white fly infestation with parasitic wasp

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Agriculture Department is continuing with a program to introduce the parasitic wasp Encarcis Guadeloupae to control widespread whitefly infestation in coconut and king coconut plantations, a government statement said.

According to the Coconut Cultivation Board, 300,00 ‘packets’ of the predator have been distributed this year.

Damage to coconut plantations caused by the white fly has been reported from several parts of the island.

However, due to the rain there has been a reduction of the damage, officials told a meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture.

They pointed out that the white fly is more attracted to the color yellow, and this has led to more damage to king coconut, which is an export crop, plantations.

After a forex crisis, the island nation is in a drive to increase exports, particularly of agriculture crops. However, extreme weather patterns brought on by climate change have proved a challenge.

Encarcis Guadeloupae, a small parasitic wasp used to control multiple whitefly pests, is considered an important biological control agent of whiteflies around the globe.

Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries Mahinda Amaraweera also announced a hotline, 1916, will be active from Monday (5) for problems related to coconut cultivation. (Colombo/Aug2/2024)
