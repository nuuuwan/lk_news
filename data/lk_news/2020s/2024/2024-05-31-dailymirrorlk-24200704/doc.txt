EC defends talks with Julie Chung amid criticisms

Colombo, May 30 (Daily Mirror) - Following severe criticism that US Ambassador Julie Chung had interfered in discussing Sri Lanka’s election process with the Election Commission (EC) officials, the EC chairman R.M.A.L. Rathnayake defended the move saying that the discussion with Chung was a casual one.

He told Daily Mirror that in the discussion that took place on Tuesday (28), Chung had asked if the election would be held during the period from between September 17 and October 16 as officially announced by the EC.

“The focal point of the meeting was to discuss the election process. Besides, plans for elections were also discussed. However, there was nothing serious or influencing discussed during the meeting which lasted only 30 minutes. It was just a courtesy call,” he underscored.

He also noted that the appointment for the meeting was made two weeks ago and it came from the US Embassy.

This follows heavy criticism on social media that the US is influencing Sri Lanka’s internal affairs.

People have voiced serious concerns on social media as to why it was necessary for a foreign ambassador to meet with the Election Commission while others said US interference was not needed because Sri Lankan citizens were aware of the importance of a free and fair election.

Some social media users even went to the extent saying that the Election Commission was an independent body and therefore foreign interference would only dampen its image.
