Sri Lanka consumer confidence improves marginally in December 2023: survey

ECONOMYNEXT – An Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS) run by the Institute for Health Policy (IHP), an independent research institute in Sri Lanka, increased 4 points to 21 points in December 2023.

ICS is the broadest measure of the public’s view of their personal economic status and the national economy. The IHP said in a statement on January 12 that that the Index of Consumer Expectations (ICE), which tracks future perceptions increased 5 points to 26 points, while the Index of Current Conditions (ICC), a measure of perceptions of current conditions, also rose 4 points to 15

Regardless of the increase, the IHP said, all three indices remain at pessimistic levels.

These measures are part a series of Consumer Confidence Indices generated from the IHP’s Sri Lanka Opinion Tracker Survey (SLOTS), which it also uses to run its political voting intent and candidate favourability polls.All IHP SLOTS consumer confidence indices range from zero to a potential maximum of 100, with levels below 50 indicating net pessimism, the IHP said.

The CCI estimates are based on 522 interviews conducted in December 2023 and 14,245 adults surveyed between October 21, 2021–December 31, 2023, with sample sizes varying between indices depending on response rates. All estimates are adjusted to be representative of the national population, including gender, age, ethnicity, and income level.

The SLOTS platform tracks public opinion and wellbeing daily using a large national panel recruited by face-to-face interviews and other randomly dialled respondents, with numerous peer-reviewed scientific publications that use the data.

The IHP’s SLOTS was launched in August 2021 to track public experience and opinion during the recovery from COVID-19. It has been extended to track public perceptions during the economic crisis.

SLOTS interviews representative samples of Sri Lankan adults daily by telephone to gather their current views and situation. All interviews include a core set of common questions, with additional rotating sets of other questions that examine issues of topical importance. The survey has previously been funded by the Neelan Tiruchelvam Trust, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), the Asia Foundation in Sri Lanka, and others. Current fieldwork is financed by the IHP Public Interest Research Fund and others, the IHP said. (Colombo/Dec13/2023)
