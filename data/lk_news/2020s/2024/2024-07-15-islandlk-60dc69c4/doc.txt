People’s Bank Entrepreneurship Village Competition 2023 winners were recognized and rewarded at a special award ceremony held recently at People’s Bank Staff Training College auditorium in Colombo 5 which was graced by the presence of Chief Executive Officer/General Manager Clive Fonseka.

People’s Bank introduced the Entrepreneurship Villages concept in 2023 to achieve several key objectives of the bank which included financially empowering rural communities.

The bank aims to achieve this by making available financial and non-financial services and providing concessional credit facilities, to absorb them into the formal banking system. The ultimate objective of this program is to strengthen the entrepreneurial abilities through the financial and non-financial services offered to these groups and help them develop their products to export standards.
