Excessive exposure to sunlight may cause blindness

Colombo, March 7 (Daily Mirror) - During the prevalence of dry weather, exposure to excessive sunlight can lead to blindness, Eye Surgeon Dr. Mudita Kulatunga said.

She mentioned that it is important to drink water to prevent the eyes from drying due to excessive sunlight and to use glasses and helmets to prevent the reflection of ultraviolet rays into the eyes.

The doctor advised parents to make the children wear a face protective cap or sunglasses to protect their eyes from direct sunlight.

People who spend a considerable amount of time outdoors and are exposed to sunlight (Ultra Violet (UV) Rays) almost all the time are likely to develop severe eye problems such as macular degeneration.

Construction workers who always engage in their work outdoors, supervisors, and traffic police are essentially advised to wear sunglasses.
