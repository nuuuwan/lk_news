Sajith not ready for Presidential debate hosted by Daily Mirror?

Colombo, April 09 (Daily Mirror) -  The participation of Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa for a Presidential debate together with President Ranil Wickremesinghe and NPP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake hosted by the Daily Mirror is uncertain with SJB Manager Nalin Banadara Jayamaha stating that it is unbelievable that Dissanayake has agreed to it.

"It is unbelievable that Dissanayake has agreed for a debate with the President and Mr. Premadasa after declining to accept the challenge thrown at him by us, and agreeing for the debate with Mr. Premadasa and President Wickremesinghe.

"We are ready for the debate which was suggested by us. Then the economic experts of both parties could have their debate," he added.

Meanwhile Mr. Premadasa told a public meeting in the North-Western Province that the most important way for a political leader is to compete with his rivals to carry out development work in a competitive  way."

"You can debate, assissinate one's character or carry out development work in a competitive manner. However, the best way is to carry out various development work while competing with each other," he said.

The Daily Mirror and the Lankadeepa had invited President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa and NPP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake for a political debate.
