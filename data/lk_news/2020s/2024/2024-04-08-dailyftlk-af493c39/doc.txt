SLFP to hold politburo meeting today

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has scheduled a gathering of its politburo today (8) to strategise on navigating the party’s current internal crisis and charting its future course of action.

Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga is expected to preside over the meeting.

On 4 April, the Colombo District Court issued an interim injunction restraining former President Maithripala Sirisena from carrying out his duties as the SLFP Chairman, in response to a complaint lodged by Kumaratunga.

However, Sirisena has responded, stating his intention to provide the court with relevant information on the issue. Meanwhile, SLFP Acting General Secretary Dushmantha Mithrapala filed a complaint with the Maradana Police on Friday (5), alleging the disappearance of several ‘important’ files from the party headquarters.

Consequently, access to the SLFP headquarters in Darley Road, Colombo 10, has been restricted as the Police investigate the complaint. However, the scheduled politburo meeting will proceed at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute.

It has been reported that all party members, with the exception of former President Sirisena, former General Secretary Dayasiri Jayasekara, and MP Shan Vijayalal de Silva, have been invited to attend the meeting.
