Doctors to launch indefinite strike from tomorrow

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) has decided to launch an indefinite strike starting from tomorrow (Jan. 24).

Accordingly, government doctors will commence the strike from 08.00 a.m. tomorrow, as the government has temporarily suspended the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance, the GMOA said.

The GMOA states that the decision was reached following information received that the government has decided not to provide the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance which was increased by Rs. 35,000 from the month of January as previously promised.

On January 08, the Cabinet of Ministers gave its approval to President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s proposal to double the DAT allowance paid to government doctors, raising it from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000.

Since then, the health sector employees’ trade unions representing a wide range of health sector professionals, including radiology and laboratory technicians, pharmacists and drug compounders, midwives, Public Health Inspectors, and entomology officers have launched strikes on multiple occasions in protest of the government’s decision and demanding an allowance increase for all health sector employees.
