Rs. 300 m boost for handloom industry to empower women and youth

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the implementation of a comprehensive development program for the handloom industry, aimed at empowering women and youth.

The initiative comes with a significant allocation of Rs. 300 million from the 2024 Budget.

“This program addresses several key challenges faced by handloom industrialists, including a lack of entrepreneurial skills, insufficient and environmentally friendly infrastructure, the need for high-quality products that meet market demands and inadequate marketing facilities,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

Noting that a combined project proposal was prepared to tackle these issues, he said the recommendations of the Department of National Planning have been incorporated into the plan.

The development programs identified in the project proposal will be implemented by the National Enterprise Development Authority, the Department of Handloom, Lanka Salu Sala Ltd., and the National Design Center.

“These institutions will work together to enhance the skills and infrastructure of those engaged in the handloom industry, thereby increasing the quality and marketability of their products,” he added.

Gunawardena added that the initiative aims to provide a sustainable boost to the handloom sector, promoting economic growth and improving livelihoods for women and youth involved in this traditional craft.
