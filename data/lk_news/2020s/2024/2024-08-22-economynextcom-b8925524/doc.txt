United Petroleum launches services in Sri Lanka

ECONOMYNEXT – United Petroleum of Australia was launched in Sri Lanka on Thursday (22), Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera said.

“They will commence retail fuel operations in September with 150 dealer owned and operated fuel stations,” Wijesekera said on X (twitter).

United Petroleum becomes the fourth retail operator to enter the Sri Lankan market after LIOC, Sinopec, RM Parks-Shell.

The company signed an agreement with the Ministry of Power and Energy earlier this year to enter petroleum retail operations in the island.

Sri Lanka last year awarded retail fuel licenses to three foreign firms – China’s Sinopec, United Petroleum Australia and US-based RM Parks to reduce the state-owned Ceylon Petroleum Corporation’s (CPC) pressure on finding foreign currency for the country’s whole fuel import.

The government imposed conditions for all three fuel retailers to use foreign currency from their parent company for imports while banning the repatriations of foreign currency from Sri Lanka.
