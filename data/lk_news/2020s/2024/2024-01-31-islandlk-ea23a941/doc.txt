The easy way with Aloe Vera

This week I’m touching on beauty tips, connected with aloe vera, as most homes have aloe vera plants, in their garden, and so you don’t need to stretch your budget to buy expensive veggies to enhance your beauty. Moreover, aloe vera is a medicinal plant with antioxidant and antibacterial properties.

Cut an aloe vera leaf and scoop out the transparent, fleshy part, with a spoon. Apply this gel on your face, focusing on the affected area. Leave it on overnight and then rinse it off in the morning. Repeat every day until the lesions heal.

two tablespoons of pure aloe vera gel with four tablespoons of honey and half a teaspoon of cinnamon powder or oil. Apply the mixture to the affected area and wash it off after 10 minutes. Do this every alternate day.

¼ teaspoon of lemon juice with 02 tablespoons of fresh aloe vera gel and apply the mixture to the affected area. After it dries, wash if off. If you are going out, use a sunscreen as lemon makes your skin photosensitive.

one teaspoon of fresh aloe vera gel with 03-04 drops of sweet almond oil (or any other oil of your choice) and apply it to your face. Wash it off after a few minutes.

a teaspoon each of cucumber juice, rose water, and fresh aloe vera gel. Use a cotton ball to apply the mixture on the affected area or all over your face. Wash it off after it dries.

Make a paste with a pinch of turmeric, a small quantity of honey and fresh aloe vera gel. Make sure that you mix it well. Apply the paste on to the face, neck and hand and keep it for 20 minutes. Then wash it off with lukewarm water. Do this once in a week.
