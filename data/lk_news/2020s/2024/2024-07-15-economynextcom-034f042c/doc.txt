Free hold land grants blocked 20-years ago by Sri Lanka court decision: President

ECONOMYNEXT – A court decision blocked an attempt to give freehold rights to people 20 years ago, Sri Lanka’s President Ranil Wickremesinghe said, at a ceremony where 662 people in the Badulla District were given deeds.

“The “Urumaya” Program was implemented in this country in 2002 and 2003 but was halted by a court decision.”

“The government took the land from the people to build the Kotmale Reservoir and the Theldeniya Reservoir, relocating those affected to these areas,” Wickremesinghe was quoted as saying by his media division.

When he tried to do this in 2002-03, the court said a referendum was needed to do so.

“This necessitated a new law to provide these lands under the Land Development Ordinance. I presented the draft law, but the Supreme Court ruled that a referendum was necessary to pass such legislation.”

“If we had the opportunity to implement that program back then, we could have confirmed freehold land rights for the people 20 years ago. However, foreign investors were later given free land instead.

“If it was possible to allocate government land to the Shangri-La Hotel under the Land Ordinance, why can’t I, as the President, grant land rights to 2 million people?” (Colombo/Jul15/2024)
