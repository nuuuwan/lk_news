G.L. slams President’s proposal on Speaker and CJ consultation over Acting IGP appointment

MP Prof. G.L. Peiris calls President’s proposal asking Speaker to consult with CJ as preposterous and warns of severe legal consequences

Stresses any attempt by Speaker to discuss an active case with CJ would constitute contempt of court

Says although Speaker presides over CC it is not a functioning Parliamentary committee and thus subject to court intervention

Freedom People’s Congress (FPC) member MP Prof. G.L. Peiris has denounced President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s recent proposal for the Speaker of Parliament to consult with the Chief Justice regarding an ongoing Supreme Court case about the appointment of the Chief of Police. Peiris described the proposal as preposterous and warned of severe legal consequences.

“The President’s suggestion is unprecedented and highly inappropriate,” said Peiris. “The case is still under review, with the Supreme Court yet to issue a final ruling. The interim order from the three-judge panel is pending, and the case will continue in November after the presidential election.”

Peiris emphasised that any attempt by the Speaker to discuss an active case with the Chief Justice would constitute contempt of court. “The Speaker would be breaching legal protocols and could face serious repercussions. There is no constitutional immunity in this matter, and the Speaker must adhere to the law.”

According to Peiris, the President should follow constitutional procedures to appoint an acting Inspector General of Police (IGP) for 14 days, after which the Constitutional Council must approve the appointment. “This process ensures that the appointment is not solely at the President’s discretion,” he noted.

Addressing Wickremesinghe’s concerns about potential election petitions, Peiris argued that the Constitutional Council’s approval negates any grounds for such petitions. He suggested that the President’s claims are baseless and intended to create unnecessary complications for personal political gain.

Peiris also criticised the President’s hasty action in filing his election deposit, suggesting it was a deliberate strategy to disrupt the election process. “The President’s rush to deposit his funds on the first day indicates his intention to undermine the election and further his political objectives,” he said.

Peiris also condemned the President’s challenge to court orders in Parliament under the guise of parliamentary privileges. He explained that although the Speaker presides over the Constitutional Council, it is not a functioning Parliamentary committee and thus subject to court intervention.

Peiris also highlighted that President Wickremesinghe appointed former IGP C.D. Wickremeratne as Acting IGP on three occasions, contradicting his claims of having no power to appoint an Acting IGP. He further alleged that the President is attempting to create chaos and push the country towards anarchy. Peiris assured that the Samagi Jana Sandhanaya (SJS) will defeat any conspiracies by the President and emerge victorious in the elections, emphasising the importance of upholding the rule of law and the constitution.
