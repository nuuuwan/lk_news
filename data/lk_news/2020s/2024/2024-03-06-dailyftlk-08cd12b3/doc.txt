Basil returns; rules out Rajapaksa candidate for Presidency

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) founder Basil Rajapaksa on his return to the country yesterday from the US, remarked that he does not foresee a Rajapaksa family member being put forward as a Presidential candidate.

Speaking to the media he said his intention to confer with party members and the party leader in the days ahead to decide whether to endorse the current president’s candidacy or nominate a candidate from within the party.

However, Rajapaksa said that he intends to lead the SLPP’s preparations for the upcoming elections.

He stressed the necessity of the SLPP’s support, noting that without it, no Government candidate would be able to contest the Presidential polls.

A group of SLPP members including Chief Government Whip Prasanna Ranatunga, party General Secretary and MP Sagara Kariyawasam, MP Sarath Weerasekera were at the airport to welcome him.
