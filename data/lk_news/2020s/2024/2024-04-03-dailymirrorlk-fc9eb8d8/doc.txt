Cardinal Ranjith never received prior warnings: Fr. Cyril Gamini

Colombo, April 3 (Daily Mirror)- Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith never received any prior warnings on the Easter Sunday attacks, the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka said today.

Church Spokesman Fr. Cyril Gamini Fernando, responding to a question raised by journalists at a media briefing said speculations that Cardinal Ranjith had received prior warnings of the Easter Sunday attacks were totally false.

"The story that Cardinal Ranjith did not participate in an Easter service on the fateful year of 2019 is also false as he did hold an Easter Vigil on April 20, 2019. The Archbishop of Colombo traditionally participates in the Easter service on Saturday night and does not participate in any service on Easter Sunday," Fr. Fernando said.
