WNPS Monthly Lecture today

Anya Ratnayaka to speak on Unmasking Sri Lanka’s Small Wild Cats

Anya Ratnayaka Founder of the Urban Fishing Cat Conservation Project

The Wildlife and Nature Protection Society will hold its monthly lecture today at 6.00 p.m. at the Jasmine Hall, BMICH.

Specialist Anya Ratnayaka will speak on to speak on  “Insights into Feline Ecology:  Unmasking Sri Lanka’s Small Wild Cats.”

In the March 2024 NTB WNPS monthly lecture, PhD Candidate Anya Ratnayaka, from the University of Queensland, will unveil the secrets of Sri Lanka’s small wild cats and shed light on their secretive lives as well as the critical conservation efforts needed to safeguard these iconic species and their habitats.

Anya’s research focuses on the ecology and behaviour of Sri Lanka’s urban population of fishing cats, one of the two  small wild cat species in Sri Lanka, that has a unique semi-aquatic lifestyle. Collaborating with government agencies, she leads a team of biologists striving for effective conservation measures to combat escalating threats such as urban wetland habitat loss, fragmentation, and human-wildlife conflicts.

The talk, will showcase captivating insights into the ecology of the Fishing Cat (Prionailurus viverrinus), known for its comical call and buff leopard-like appearance, the Jungle Cat (Felis chaus), a crucial terrestrial predator controlling rodent populations, and the elusive Rusty-Spotted Cat, (Prionailurus rubiginosus) the smallest wild cat in the world.

Anya will discuss various ecosystems across the island where these small cats inhabit, each with its unique ecological niche. From nocturnal hunting behaviors to their adaptation to diverse habitats, these small cats offer a fascinating glimpse into Sri Lanka’s rich biodiversity.

The talk will also delve into cutting-edge research technology aimed at unraveling the ecological roles of these small wild cats and address the conservation challenges they face. Anya will emphasize the importance of citizen involvement in protecting these charismatic species for the long-term health and resilience of Sri Lanka’s ecosystems while fostering coexistence between humans and wildlife.
