Japan, UNFPA Sri Lanka gift computers to Ministry of Women and Child Affairs

ECONOMYNEXT – Supported by Japan, UNFPA Sri Lanka has handed over 278 computers to the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs to strengthen services provided for survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) in the country.

“These computers will enable Women Development Officers, Counselling Assistants & Child Rights Promotion Officers at Women Development Units across the country, to regularly update the upcoming GBV referral services database that will enable timely and effective support for survivors of GBV,” United Nations Population Fund Sri Lanka Representative Kunle Adeniyi said on X (twitter).

The database aims to improve coordination, response time and overall effectiveness of GBV interventions across Sri Lanka, he said. (Colombo/Aug22/2024)
