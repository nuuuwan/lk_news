State Minister Prasanna Ranaweera assaults ‘Porter’ at BIA

State Minister of Small and Medium Enterprises Development Prasanna Ranaweera has reportedly assaulted a Porter at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake.

Meanwhile, the State Minister has also threatened several security officers at the airport, according to sources.

Accompanied by his ministerial security personnel, Ranaweera had visited the airport with his wife in the early hours of Tuesday (May 14) as his spouse was scheduled to travel overseas.

The state minister had attempted to enter the airport through its main entrance along with his ministerial security officers who were carrying firearms, sources said.

At that moment, the airport security officers have informed the state minister that they could not allow the ministerial security officers to enter the airport while carrying the firearms.

The state minister had then allegedly proceeded to verbally abuse the airport security officers.

Airport sources said State Minister Prasanna Ranaweera had later also assaulted the porter who was pushing the trolley carrying the luggage of the state minister’s wife.

An incident in which the porter in question had objected to the state minister paying him a sum of only Rs. 700, despite signs at the airport clearly stating that a porter should be paid a fee of Rs. 1,000, is said to have led to the assault incident.

The state minister had reportedly left the airport premises after slapping the porter in the face. The airport employee n question, a resident of Kurunegala, had then visited the airport police station to lodge a complaint regarding the incident.

However, due to the absence of the officer-in-charge (OIC) at that time, the police officers present had informed the porter to return the next morning. But the assaulted porter has reportedly not visited the police station after that.

Ada Derana inquired from State Minister Prasanna Ranaweera regarding this incident.

“I got angry at that time. I called him and pulled him to the side. I slapped him, that’s true,” the state minister admitted.

The website of the Bandaranaike International Airport states the following regarding its Porter service:

“Passengers, who wish to obtain the services of Porters, could do so at the departure outer porch and arrival baggage claim area. A fee has been approved for them by the AASL and they have been advised to offer this service up-to the check-in counters at Departures and up to the outer porch at Arrivals.”

“Rs. 1000.00 per passenger (for maximum 04 baggages only) and Rs. 250.00 for additional baggage for both Arrival and Departure round the clock.”
