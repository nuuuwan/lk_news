Land bridge with India to bring mutual benefits: Sagala

Colombo, May 1 (Daily Mirror)- Chief of Staff of the President, Sagala Ratnayake said the proposed land bridge with India will benefit both countries.

Making his remarks at the UNP May Day rally, he said it is economical for India to use the Sri Lankan ports to unload India-bound containers and then transport them by road to their destinations.
