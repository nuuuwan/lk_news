Sri Lanka to bring in 40 new influencers to promote tourism

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will bring in 40 new influencers to promote tourism in the country, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, Chalaka Gajabahu, said.

“Today we are going to discuss with the board and we are going to bring 40 [influencers],” Gajabahu told reporters this week.

“When countries had put Sri Lanka on a red alert, we did a seeing-is-believing influencer campaign where we invited influencers to see for themselves. We have brought 190 influencers and that is why we are the top 5 in all the world’s travel indexes.”

In January, Sri Lanka announced the start of a 1.5 billion tourist campaign including working with social media influencers such as Nas Daily and Luke Martin.

Sri Lanka Tourist Development Authority (SLTDA) data shows that Sri Lanka has welcomed 1.1 million tourists from January to July 2024 and plans to bring 2.3 million tourists by the end of 2024.

“When we bring influencers, we make sure they focus on different markets, some are on wildlife, some are on wellness – we bring based on what we want to promote,” Managing Director of the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, Nalin Fernando, said.  (Colombo/Jul27/2024)
