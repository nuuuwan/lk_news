Royal Beach Saman’s assassination linked to decades-old conflict with ’Kosgoda Sujee’

Colombo, Jan 23 (Daily Mirror) - While multiple police teams are conducting investigations over the manslaughter of five persons in Beliatta, police revealed that the shooting was a result of conflicts between major organized criminal and drug trafficker 'Kosgoda Sujee' and 'Ape Jana Bala' Party leader Saman Perera over drug trafficking and the killing of Sujee's uncle and brother in 2004.

Five individuals, including Saman Perera, also known as 'Royal Beach Saman,' were shot dead near the Beliatta-Kahawatta interchange of the Southern Expressway when they were enroute to a court appearance in Tangalle.
