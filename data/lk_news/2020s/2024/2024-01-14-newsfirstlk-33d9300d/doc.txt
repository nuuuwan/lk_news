Acting Inspector General of Police Deshbandu Tennakoon has instructed all police divisional OICs, district OICs, station OICs, and crime OICs to actively participate in Operation Yukthiya starting today.

This directive came during an awareness program for the officers.

The Ministry of Public Security provided vital information for the operation, including 35,505 warrants issued, 4,258 suspects identified through fingerprints, and 2,485 known suspects wanted for previous offenses.

The Acting IGP emphasized intensive deployment of all crime branch officers 24/7 for the next month, covering all police divisions under Operation Yukthiya.
