Hospitals Brace for Disruptions as Healthcare Workers Plan To Strike Tomorrow

COLOMBO (News 1st); Tensions are brewing in the Sri Lankan healthcare sector as several supplementary medical professional associations have announced a trade union action effective tomorrow, potentially leaving crucial services unattended.

The move stems from a recent decision by the President to increase doctors' allowances by Rs. 35,000, a decision that other healthcare professionals feel unfairly excludes them.

Public Health Inspectors Union of Sri Lanka Secretary, Shanaka Bopitiya, confirmed the planned action, stating that all professional associations in the health sector, except for doctors, will participate.

This involves a wide range of personnel, including nurses, paramedical staff, and public health inspectors, potentially impacting various healthcare services across the country.

They demand the same increase in their allowances, arguing that their contribution to the healthcare system is equally vital.
