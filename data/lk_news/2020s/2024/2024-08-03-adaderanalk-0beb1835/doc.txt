Dayasiri to back Sajith in Presidential Election

Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MP Dayasiri Jayasekera says that he will support Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) candidate Sajith Premadasa at the upcoming Presidential Election.

Holding a press conference in Colombo today (03), Dayasiri stated that both the SLFP’s Central Committee and Executive Committee arrived at this decision to back SJB’s “Samagi Jana Sandhanaya.”

Speaking further he said: “This is a historic decision for the SLFP. We were in an anti-government ideology for the past period, so we cannot turn that back now… We are continuing with the decision that the party arrived at on November 11, 2023 to not join the government.”

Several members of the party including Thilanga Sumathipala and Rohana Luxman Piyadasa were also present at the occasion.
