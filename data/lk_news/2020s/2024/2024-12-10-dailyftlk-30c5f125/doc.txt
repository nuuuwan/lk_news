Roar Global, Sri Lanka’s leading provider of platform-specific digital marketing solutions, celebrated 10 years of pioneering digital transformation in the APAC region with its clients and partners.

The event, held at the newly inaugurated Cinnamon Life at City of Dreams, brought together industry leaders, experts, clients, and Roar’s valued partners to reflect on the company’s remarkable journey and unveil its ambitious vision for the future.

The evening commenced with a warm welcome from Roar Global Founder and CEO Mustafa Kassim, who shared the origins of Roar and reflected on its milestones and key achievements over the past 10 years. Founded in 2014 with a mission to redefine digital media and marketing in Sri Lanka, Roar has evolved into a global brand with a diverse portfolio of business units, each driving digital transformation in their respective fields.

Roar Global Chief Marketing Officer Umair Wolid moderated an engaging session with representatives from every business unit at Roar. This session highlighted the evolution of Roar Global. From its flagship content platform, Roar Media, which continues to deliver breakthrough content at scale, to Roar AdX, launched in 2020 with a Meta Partnership in Sri Lanka, the company’s growth trajectory reflects its commitment to staying ahead in the ever-evolving digital marketing landscape. In 2022, Roar expanded its footprint in the region by launching 3P Media, the official media sales representative for Google in Sri Lanka, Laos, and Brunei, further solidifying its position as a trusted partner for global platforms to connect with businesses seeking to amplify their digital advertising. Roar Apex is crucial in helping businesses in Australia and the USA access top-tier remote talent in Asia.

Meanwhile, Creator Flow, Australia’s largest UGC marketplace, excels in connecting brands with creators to produce content that drives impactful results.

The session also outlined the strategic vision for each business unit, emphasising Roar Global’s commitment to fostering stronger partnerships with businesses in Sri Lanka and across international markets.

Kassim said: “Roar’s growth over the past decade has been a remarkable journey, made possible by the unwavering trust of our partners, the loyalty of our clients, and the incredible dedication of our team. I am deeply grateful to everyone who has been part of this story, and I look forward to continuing to build a future driven by innovation and collaboration.”

The evening concluded with a heartfelt thank-you from Chief Operating Officer Prash Balakrishnan, who expressed gratitude to all attendees for their unwavering support and belief in Roar.  “As we look ahead, Roar is entering an exciting phase of growth driven by regional expansion and strategic acquisitions.
