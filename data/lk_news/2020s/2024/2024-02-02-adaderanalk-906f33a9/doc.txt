Health trade unions temporarily call off strike action

The health sector trade unions have decided to temporarily call off the ongoing island-wide strike action by 06.30 a.m. on Saturday (Feb. 03).

A collective of 72 trade unions from the health sector resorted to a one-day strike across the country last morning (Feb.01), which continued for the second day straight today, urging the government to address the issues concerning allowances without delay.

The doctors’ unions and the All Ceylon Nurses’ Union, however, decided to refrain from joining the strike action, alleging that the planned strike action was a conspiracy by the government.

In response to the island-wide strike, tri-force personnel were deployed to the state hospitals across the country, depending on the requirements at each facility to ensure uninterrupted provision of essential medical services to the public.
