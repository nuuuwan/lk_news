Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to set up Support Unit within President’s Office

Cabinet approves move after considering President’s presentation on policy support from Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

Global Health Strategies, by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and its local partner Connect to Care Organisation, are to establish a Program Support Unit within the President’s Office.

“The Cabinet of Ministers deliberated on the issues presented by the President concerning the policy support envisioned by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the Presidential Secretariat. Subsequently, approval was granted by the Cabinet of Ministers to proceed with the necessary steps in this regard,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said last week.

Speaking at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing he said that the President’s Office collaborates with multi-stakeholder organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and Asian Development Bank, providing guidance on policy matters and monitoring Government initiatives. To enhance these efforts, a Program Support Unit will be established through a partnership with Global Health Strategies, an organisation backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and its local partner Connect to Care Organisation.

“This initiative aims to actively contribute to the Government’s objectives, with an appointed Executive Committee ensuring proper coordination for effective program implementation,” he pointed out.

Accordingly, an Executive Committee consisting of senior officials will be appointed to ensure proper coordination for the implementation of the various programs being implemented by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
