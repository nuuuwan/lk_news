Court order preventing SYU protest in Colombo

COLOMBO (News 1st) – The Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court has issued an order to Eranga Gunasekara, National Organiser of the Socialist Youth Association, prohibiting them from entering Parliament Road from the Polduwa Roundabout and engaging in protest activity that could oppress the people.

The order was issued after considering a statement from the Welikada Police Station Commander.

The court order instructs Gunasekara and the group to refrain from blocking any roads, engaging in any violent acts that could cause public disorder, or conducting their protest in a manner that violates the parliamentary privileges of public representatives or obstructs the duties of public officials.
