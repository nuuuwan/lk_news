Japan pledges Rs. 2.8 b for solar energy in hospitals

The Government of Japan has pledged project support totalling Yen 1.23 billion (around Rs. 2.8 billion) through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).

The funding will facilitate the establishment of solar energy generation systems at three key hospitals in the country.

The beneficiaries of this initiative include Sri Jayewardenepura General Hospital, Kurunegala Teaching Hospital and Ratnapura Teaching Hospital, where solar energy facilities will be installed to provide electricity. The project aims to reduce reliance on non-renewable energy sources within the healthcare sector, thereby contributing to environmental conservation efforts.

The objectives of this project are to reduce the use of non-renewable energy in the health sector, to increase the overall efficiency of the health service sector and to promote sustainable development.

By harnessing solar power to meet electricity needs, the participating hospitals are expected to reduce operational costs, minimise carbon emissions and contribute to the countryâ€™s broader efforts towards green energy adoption.

Upon thorough review and consideration, the Cabinet of Ministers this week approved the implementation of this project proposal, presented by the President in his capacity as the Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies Minister.
