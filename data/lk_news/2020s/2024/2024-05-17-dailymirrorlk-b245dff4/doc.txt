Mendis’ visa not denied, likely to join team before warm-up games: SLC CEO

Colombo, May 17 (Daily Mirror) -  Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has denied recent reports that visas for two key players, including Kusal Mendis, in the Sri Lankan squad for the T20 World Cup had been rejected.

CEO Ashley de Silva said that Mendis' visa is currently under process and that he will likely join the team before the warm-up games.

It was reported that Kusal Mendis and Asitha Fernando declined to travel to the United States for the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup, despite the rest of the squad having departed for the USA.

Ashley de Silva said that Kusal's visa has not been rejected and the US embassy is in touch with Sri Lanka Cricket to get the visa approved.

"The visas of the players were not rejected. There is a process which Kusal has to go through. Hopefully, we should get the visa within the next two days. The information circulating that visas had been rejected is not correct. The Embassy is in the process of issuing it. But the Embassy has asked for more information from Kusal and when he submits those documents, the visa will be approved," the CEO said.

The CEO mentioned that fast bowler Asitha Fernando has received his visa to travel to the USA.

"Actually, the ICC support period will start on May 25, but we sent our team to the US two weeks in advance to get familiar with the conditions there. So, there is no delay. Hopefully, Kusal will join the team soon and be able to play two warm-up games as well," the CEO said.

Sri Lanka is set to play two warm-up games ahead of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024, starting from May 28. They will take on Netherlands in their first warm-up game on May 28 at Broward County Stadium in Florida. In their second warm-up game, Sri Lanka will face Ireland on May 31 at the same venue.
