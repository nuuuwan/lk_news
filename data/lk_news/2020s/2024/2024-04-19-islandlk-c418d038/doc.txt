Dialog-Airtel Lanka merger comes centre stage

Sri Lanka’s premier mobile phone company, Dialog Axiata, will issue 952 million shares by way of a share swap to Bharti Airtel to acquire the latter organization. The deal was finalized yesterday, CSE market analysts said.

Bharti Airtel and Dialog Axiata entered into a Binding Agreement to merge their operations in May 2023. Dialog is the largest telecom service provider in Sri Lanka with more than 17 million subscribers as of 2021, representing around 51 percent of the market. Airtel Lanka has about 5 million subscribers. The 952 million Dialog shares amount to 10.4 percent of the total shares issued by the company.

However, the stock market was sluggish because profit takings came to the fore due to continued uncertainty in the external debt restructuring exercise. Both indices moved downwards. The All Share Price Index went down by 33.1 points, while the S and P SL20 declined by 8.81 points. Turnover stood at Rs 2.22 billion with 3 crossings.
