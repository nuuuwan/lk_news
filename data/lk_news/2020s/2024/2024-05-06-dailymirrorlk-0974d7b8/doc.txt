Sri Lanka to retain existing visa fee

Colombo, May 06 (Daily Mirror) - The Cabinet decided to uphold the existing visa fee of USD 50 for a 30-day visa for foreign visitors to Sri Lanka, the Presidentâ€™s Media Division announced today.

The Cabinet also reaffirmed the provision of free visa services to citizens of seven countries, including India, China and Japan, among others.

The Department of Immigration and Emigration will continue to oversee the issuing of relevant visas upon entry into the country for foreigners.

The decision comes in response to calls from various stakeholders within the tourism industry, who advocated for maintaining the current visa fee to sustain the sector's growth momentum.
