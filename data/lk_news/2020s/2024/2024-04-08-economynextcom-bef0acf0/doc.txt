Sri Lanka issues guidelines for holiday activities, cautions people to avoid accidents

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s health officials and Police are cautioning the public to avoid accidents in the upcoming holiday period.

“Every year around this time we see a rise in various fatal accidents – road accidents, drowning, explosions and sports injuries – and increased numbers of people being hospitalized,” Minister of Health Ramesh Pathirana said at a press briefing to launch a set of guidelines for conducting sporting events (avurudu kreeda) ahead of the festivities this week.

“We entreat people to be vigilant about their and others’ safety during this festival period.

Pathirana said that health officials had studied 5 years of data and seen an increase in accidents every year during this period.

“If someone is injured, please don’t transport them in three-wheelers. This can do more damage, especially if they have fractures,” Health Ministry official and Consultant Community Physician Samitha Siritunga said.

Police Director of Traffic SP Indika Hapugoda said the Police had increased the deployment of personnel for the four-day holiday.

“We don’t have a shortage of breathalyzers, we have procured 150,000 units. In addition, we also have saliva and urine test kits to detect drivers high on other substances.
