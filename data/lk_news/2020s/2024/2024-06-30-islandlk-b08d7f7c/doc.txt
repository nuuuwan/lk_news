Learning to lead in academia in London

Early in my academic career, I understood that excelling in both teaching and publishing was essential for any serious post-secondary educator. While college-level teaching focuses heavily on instruction, universities expect their faculty to also contribute to academic research and publish in respected peer-reviewed journals. This scholarly input is critical for advancing in tenure-track positions, such as Associate Professor and Professor. I realized that my practical experience in hospitality operations and management could significantly enrich my research and publications.

In 1990, I had limited connections with reputable academic journals, so I began by publishing in trade magazines to gain experience. At that time, I had authored only two articles. My first article, ‘Cuisine à la Mosimann’, was published by the Chef Guild of Sri Lanka in their magazine, The Chef. My second article, ‘Internal Sales Promotion’, appeared in the Ceylon Hotel School Graduates Association’s magazine, Food & Accommodation. I later used my doctoral research at the University of Surrey to produce a longer article titled ‘Hotel Advertising’, published in the same magazine.

My boss, Professor Richard Kotas, suggested, “Chandi, let’s collaborate on publishing in reputable academic journals and with book publishers in the UK.” This idea planted a seed that grew into a prolific writing career for me, resulting in over 125 refereed journal articles and more than two dozen textbooks over the next 34 years. I owe much of my success in publishing to Professor Kotas, and my second doctoral thesis supervisor, Dr. Richard Teare.

One never knows what opportunities lie ahead. As the Assistant Director of the School of Hotel Management at Schiller International University (SIU), I was thrilled to work under my long-term mentor, Professor Kotas. Having a boss, you respect and like is crucial for job satisfaction. However, one morning, he summoned me to his office and delivered unexpected news: “Chandi, I’ve decided to leave SIU soon. I’ve accepted a good offer from Thames Valley University (formerly Ealing College), which is very close to my home in Acton.”

Sensing my dismay, Professor Kotas reassured me, “I’ve recommended you for the Acting Director position. Chandi, you have proven yourself, and you deserve this promotion.” Later, in recognition of his contributions, the university bestowed upon him the title of Professor Emeritus. His support to me was invaluable, and our friendship lasted over three more decades. My last lunch meeting with him and his wife was at their home in London in early 2020, a few months before he passed away.

In my new role, I reported directly to Dr. Richard Taylor, the Director of the London Campus of SIU. He was a perfect gentleman, and I learned a great deal about academic leadership from him. He was supportive of my suggestions, including structural changes to our office, although we faced challenges due to the historic status of our building. The main building, constructed in 1816, had been awarded Grade II listed status by English Heritage in 1980. I cherished working in such a prestigious building and having an office near Dr. Taylor’s.

The student population at SIU’s London campus was a key strength of our MA in International Hotel and Tourism Management and BBA in Hotel Management programs. During my second semester, our students came from 36 countries across five continents. Our BBA program was particularly unique, offering students the opportunity to study in four campuses in four different countries: the first year in Engleberg, Switzerland; the second year in Strasbourg, France; the third year in London, UK; and a new option of spending the final year in Dunedin, Florida, USA. This global feel was one of the highlights of my career at SIU.

Leveraging my extensive contacts in the British hotel industry, I arranged a series of guest lectures by industry leaders. Living in London provided me a significant advantage for initiating these lectures. I invited friends from Trust House Forte and my former classmates from Le Meridien Management Institute in France, to share their expertise with our students. Additionally, I arranged for Sri Lankan hoteliers working in London, such as Rohan Karr from Mable Arch Marriott, Nihal Sirisena from InterContinental corporate office, and Claire Bostock, to speak to our students. Dr. Taylor appreciated my efforts, saying, “Chandi, you are like a breath of fresh air!”

My early 1980s experience as a Senior Lecturer of the Ceylon Hotel School and teacher training gained on an UNDP/ILO fellowship in Europe helped me tremendously in my new position. Contracting senior British hospitality management educators to teach part-time at SIU presented a challenge due to the differing educational standards between the UK and the American systems we followed at SIU. For example, a 70% score in a British university was considered good, whereas in an American university, it was seen as a below average “C” grade. To address this, I included a special orientation for new part-time British lecturers on the American system to prevent unnecessary student failures.

We utilized excellent educational videos produced by the American Hotel & Motel Association to enhance classroom learning. We also allocated higher budgets for study visits to major events such as the Hotelympia Trade Show, World Travel Mart, Bar and Cocktail competitions, and events organized by the Hotel Catering and Institutional Management Association (HCIMA). Its basing in London allowed our school to fully engage with these opportunities.

During SIU ‘cultural exploration’ dinner at a Mexican restaurant in London, Katia Hekkala, a Swedish student in our BBA program, suggested, “Chandi, why don’t we organize our own event on campus and sell tickets?” Inspired by her idea, we organized a small Cheese & Wine event, which was a success. This led to a larger-scale international party featuring dishes from 36 countries, contributed by students. The success of this event prompted us to repeat it every semester.

The experience I gained at SIU in the early 1990s significantly enhanced my subsequent academic career in the Caribbean and North America.

I strengthened my foundation of professional network in England for the benefit of SIU hotel management students. My involvement as a past student of a few British professional associations such as HCIMA, Hotel and Catering Industry Training Board (HCITB) Wine and Sprit Education Trust (WEST), the Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM), opened more doors and allowed us to find additional guest lecturers to enrich our students’ learning experience.

At the 1990 HCIMA Annual General Meeting and annual lunch held in London at the Royal Lancaster Hotel I strengthened existing connections and established new ones. After that we organized a few HCIMA – London Branch events at the SIU campus. During one event, a senior hotelier from Trust House Forte and HCIMA office bearer, Mr. Merryweather, invited me to serve on their committee, stating, “Chandi, you would be an excellent addition to the 2,000-member strong HCIMA – London Branch.” Recognizing the benefits for SIU students, I accepted the invitation without hesitation.

Serving on the HCIMA committee in London taught me valuable lessons in running professional HCIMA chapters, which I later applied in establishing and leading HCIMA chapters in Sri Lanka (in 1991), Jamaica (in 1997), and Ontario, Canada (in 2002). This experience ultimately led to my election as the worldwide President of HCIMA (in 2004).

In managing a small school within a university, I found that success hinges on being “firm, fair, and friendly.” I encouraged students to address me by my first name and focused heavily on their success. I delivered bonus seminars on career planning and provided tips for establishing global careers. Many of our students achieved remarkable success in the global arena.

Even after 34 years, some of my SIU students from the early 1990s keep in touch with me. Moshi Perera, a Sri Lankan-British student, wrote to me in 2020 when he was appointed General Manager of Shangri-La Hambantota in Sri Lanka: “Thank you, Chandi. I also have lovely memories of a Sri Lankan meal you cooked and served me and two other SIU students at your London home in 1990.”

Zeynep Gürkek, a Turkish student, wrote to me after reading an article I wrote about Vienna in 2022: “Chandi, I now live in Vienna. You must visit us next time you are in Austria!”

Jaana Raisanen, a Finnish student, collaborated with me on projects in Finland, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka. A few days ago, she wrote to me on Facebook, “You were, and are, such an inspiration! Your lectures were much appreciated.”

The greatest satisfaction in a career in education is seeing students succeed in their careers and remember their time with you fondly. I feel blessed.
