Nihal Hettiarachchi and Company celebrates 40 years of excellence

NHCo marked its 40th anniversary with an event held on 16 May at the newly constructed NHCo Upskill Centre in the presence of a gathering of some long-standing clients and NHCo alumni members who worked tirelessly to contribute to the success of the firm over the past four decades.

It was a fitting occasion to reflect on NHCo’s remarkable journey, milestones, and enduring commitment in providing exceptional client services in accordance with our philosophies of achieving the right balance in everything we do. Established in 1984 under the visionary leadership of Nihal Hettiarachchi, NHCo’s humble beginnings have blossomed into a thriving firm of chartered accountants today.

In addition to their primary operations, they have expanded their reach through strategic partnerships which includes Wijeratne & Company, HLB Lanka Business Advisory, RNH BPO, RNH Holdings and LexAG. NHCo is an independent member of HLB International, an award-winning Top 10 worldwide accounting network, focused on innovation, collaboration, and cross-border client growth. This expansion is a testament to the commendable local and global teamwork and collaborations which underpin their success.

One of the memorable moments of the day was NHCo’s Founder and Senior partner Nihal Hettiarachchi along with Managing Partner Dinuk Hettiarachchi launching the company’s 40th anniversary logo and corporate video narrating NHCo’s journey. The staff of NHCo also performed a captivating traditional dance during the celebration, which brought a vibrant atmosphere to this jubilant occasion.

As NHCo commemorates its 40th anniversary and honours its legacy, it also sets its sights on the future to provide exceptional client services by leveraging its decades of expertise, innovative spirit, and passion to excellence being true to their motto Local in touch, global in reach.
