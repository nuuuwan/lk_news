3,000 Samurdhi employees to be absorbed into Department of Samurdhi Development

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved providing opportunities for around 3,000 employees of the Samurdhi Development Authority to be absorbed into the Department of Samurdhi Development.

Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena yesterday said, the move comes as part of the efforts into integrates these employees into the new structure, following the establishment of the Department of Divineguma Development under the Divineguma Act No. 01 of 2013.

“At the time of the creation of the Department of Divineguma Development, employees of the SamurdhiDevelopment Authority were given the choice to join the new Department with pension benefits, in accordance with the provisions of the Divineguma Act. However, due to various circumstances, around 3,000 employees were unable to revise their preference and make the transition,” he explained during the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing.

Recognising the need to address this issue, Gunawardena said the process of absorbing these employees will be carried out in consultation with the Public Service Commission.

The proposal to this effect submitted by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as the Finance, Economic Stability and National Policy was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
