Good scene for Sri Lankan entertainers in Qatar

It’s, indeed, encouraging to see our entertainers shining bright in the Middle East, as well.

A few weeks ago, I highlighted the band Seven Notes, performing in Dubai.

This week the spotlight is on The Exit, doing their thing in Doha, Qatar.

In fact, I’m told that the Qatar entertainment scene is packed with musicians from Sri Lankan.

Leel Perera, who is based in Doha, mentioned this to me: “I have chatted with you about Qatar and Sri Lankan entertainers. Even if you give one full page in The Island that will still not be enough to highlight everything that Sri Lankan entertainers are doing at this end.”

The band The Exit is a Sri Lankan pop/rock band, formed in 2017, in Doha Qatar.

The seven-member band comprises Tiron Ismet (lead vocals), Isuru Santiago (rhythm guitar/vocals), Asanka Mihijaya (keyboards), Nuwan Chanaka (lead guitar), Iqbal Assan (bass), Nisala Perera (drums), and Rukvinda Madushan (percussion).

Their versatility is such that they even do folk segments at selected venues, such as pubs, cocktail events, corporate events and even dinner dances and concerts.

They have also provided the backing for many popular guest artistes, including JAYASRI, Atula Adikari, Indrachapa, Kasun Kalhara, Wasthi, Falen Andria, Raini Charuka and Amal Perera.

The challenging part for the band members, they say, is their regular day jobs, and that makes it tough for them to plan out their rehearsals.

According to Tiron Ismet, whether it’s local (Sri Lankan music) or western music, The Exit can do it all. Their music is not limited to one genre, he went on to say, but encompasses rap, hip-hop, rhythm and blues, country, Hindi, and pop and rock.

A recent video clip, on social media, of the band doing the Queen hit ‘I Want To Break Free’, was well received by viewers, with Russel Kleyn saying: “We’ve been entertained by these guys for a while now; they are super awesome and know how to draw a crowd.”

Dileepa Liyanage, a musician who performed in Qatar, said: “A well-known band in Qatar for years.”
