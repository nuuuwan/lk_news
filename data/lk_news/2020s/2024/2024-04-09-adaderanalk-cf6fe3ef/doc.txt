Appeals Court to decide on Keheliya’s petition against remand order

The Court of Appeals has set a date to deliver its decision on whether or not to take up the writ application seeking to quash the remand order on former Minister of Health Keheliya Rambukwella issued by the Maligakanda Magistrate.

Accordingly, the court ordered that the decision will be communicated on April 30, 2024, Ada Derana reporter said.

The former Minister filed the relevant petition seeking to invalidate the order issued by Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court under the Public Property Act to remand him until the completion of the trial related to the alleged substandard immunoglobulin vials scandal.

Meanwhile, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has filed an interim petition requesting permission from the court to intervene and present facts in relation to the relevant petition by Rambukwella.

Through its interim petition, the BASL has sought the dismissal of Rambukwella’s writ application.
