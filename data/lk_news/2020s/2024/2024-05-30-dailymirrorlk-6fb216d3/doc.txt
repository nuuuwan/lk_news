Powerful western country concerned over SL ex-soldiers joining the Russian military

Colombo, May 30 (Daily Mirror)- A powerful western country remains concerned over Sri Lankan ex-soldiers joining the Russian military in the war against Ukraine, an informed source said.

According to the source, Sri Lankan government took initiatives to engage with the Russian authorities to seek details about Sri Lankans fighting as mercenaries of the Russian military in the wake of western concerns.

A delegation headed by Defence Secretary Kamal Gunaratne is also expected to visit Moscow for diplomatic engagements.

The source said some Sri Lankans had also joined the Ukrainian forces to fight against Russia.

The defence authorities have received hundreds of inquiries from family members of Sri Lankan soldiers in the war front there in Russia and Ukraine.

Recently, the police also arrested some individuals responsible for trafÂ­ficking people to the war front.

Most Sri Lankans are desperately trying to join the two militaries in Russia and Ukraine for money and other perks being offered.
