‘A Warm Meal for a Child’ – an initiative by Insurance Association of Sri Lanka

In a touching gesture of unity and generosity, the Insurance Association of Sri Lanka (IASL) fulfilled its mission to support the ‘Warm Meal for a Child’ initiative. Following a successful ‘Sing-Along’ fundraiser event, which was held in December 2023, the IASL team traveled to Matale to share a warm meal with 31 children aged 6-18 across two children’s homes. This heartening act not only brought joy to the recipients, but also showcased the power of corporate generosity and highlights the industry’s dedication to making a positive impact beyond insurance.
