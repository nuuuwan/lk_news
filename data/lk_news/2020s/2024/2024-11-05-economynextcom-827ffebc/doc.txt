Consistent updates on economic strategies needed from Sri Lanka gov: Former minister

ECONOMYNEXT – There is no clear communication from the Sri Lanka government on its economic strategies, former State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe has said.

“Firm and transparent messaging would prevent speculation and mitigate the spread of inaccurate information,” Semasinghe said on social media platform X (twitter).

“Consistent updates from the government on economic strategies, along with clear timelines for policy implementations, would provide assurance that these commitments are being honored.”

The former minister who worked with the International Monetary Fund team after Sri Lanka’s economic crisis, said it was “crucial for public understanding to have clarity on how these steps contribute to overall economic recovery and stability”.

The achievement of the 2025 revenue targets, including the primary surplus target of 2.3 percent of GDP, is tied to lifting vehicle import restrictions, Semasinghe said.

“This anticipated revenue from import duties and taxes is critical to supporting the government’s fiscal objectives and adhering to commitments with the IMF.
