Doctors to launch islandwide strike on Sep.18

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) has decided to launch an islandwide strike on September 18 (Wednesday).

GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe stated that the strike action has been planned in protest against the disciplinary inquiry launched against GMOA Assistant Secretary and Uva province coordinator Dr. Palitha Rajapaksa without a formal complaint.

Meanwhile, he further stated that it has been decided to display black flags in all hospitals for seven consecutive days from today onwards.

He stated that they are committed to ensure justice for Dr. Palitha Rajapaksa and that the “unfair” disciplinary inquiry should be suspended.

“This disciplinary inquiry has been initiated without any formal complaint. Dr. Palitha Rajapaksa spoke on behalf of the people of this country. He was talking about the impact from the lack of medicines and equipment at the Badulla Hospital and surrounding hospitals,” he added.
