Suspected drug trafficker injured in shooting at Borella

A 38-year-old person, said to be involved in drug dealings and who was recently released from prison on bail, has been shot and injured near a housing complex at Ananda Rajakaruna Mawatha in Borella, police said.

The gunshot victim is currently receiving treatment at the Colombo National Hospital, police reported.

According to police, an unidentified individual had arrived on a motorcycle and opened fire at the victim last night. The exact motive behind the shooting is yet to be ascertained.
