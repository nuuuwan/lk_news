Entire SL stands in solidarity with Palestine – Bimal

Minister Bimal Ratnayake has declared that Sri Lanka stands firmly with Palestine, emphasising widespread support across the nation. He made these remarks during the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People event, held in Colombo over the weekend.

Ratnayake highlighted that the turnout at the event reflected the country’s solidarity with Palestine. He reaffirmed that the new Government, led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, will continue to recognise Palestine as a free and sovereign State, working in alignment with established United Nations policies.

The event saw participation from prominent figures, including Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, religious leaders, diplomats, and other distinguished guests. Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Chairperson Imthiaz Bakeer Markar, speaking at the event, drew attention to the increasing death toll in Palestine as reported by global media.

“The calls of organisations such as the United Nations, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), and the Human Rights Commission (HRC), which exist to protect smaller nations like ours, are not being heeded,” he said.

He emphasised that if a small country like Sri Lanka were to face a fate similar to Palestine, it would be crucial for these organisations and the global community to unite and work together.
