Dry weather impacts consistent water supply

Colombo, March 11 (Daily Mirror) - In light of the ongoing dry weather conditions, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board has highlighted hurdles in maintaining consistent water supply across various regions.

The increased daily water demand exacerbates the situation, resulting in some areas receiving water at reduced pressure or facing restrictions.

The BoardÂ emphasized the need for proactive measures to address these challenges.

To facilitate public feedback and address concerns effectively, the NWSD has introduced a dedicated hotline, 1939, for lodging complaints related to water supply disruptions.
