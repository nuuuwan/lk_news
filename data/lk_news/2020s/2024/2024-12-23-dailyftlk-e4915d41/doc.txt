Elpitiya Plantations PLC has marked an extraordinary year, earning accolades at two of Sri Lanka’s most prestigious award ceremonies — the TAGS Awards 2024 by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) and the Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Awards by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce. The company in a statement said these honours reflect the company’s dedication to financial transparency, environmental stewardship, and its transformative journey through biodiversity

Under the leadership of Chairman Dr. Parakrama Dissanayake, Managing Director Dr. Rohan Fernando, and CEO and Joint Managing Director Bhathiya Bulumulla, and managed by Aitken Spence Plantation Managements PLC since 1997, Elpitiya oversees 13 estates and 17 factories, producing tea and diversified crops. It has pioneered berry cultivation in Sri Lanka, reducing import reliance, while expanding into sustainable forestry, eco-tourism, hydropower, and specialty tea manufacturing.

At the TAGS Awards 2024, Elpitiya Plantations was celebrated as the Bronze winner in the Plantations Sector, in recognition of its excellence in financial reporting adhering to global reporting standards. The company also received a Certificate of Recognition for Sustainability Reporting.

The company’s sustainability achievements were further reinforced at the Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Awards, where it earned the title of Second Runner-Up in the category of companies with revenue below Rs. 15 billion. The company also received recognition for its innovative project, “Grow to Grow,” which focuses on cultivating bamboo as a renewable source of biomass.

This honour underscores Elpitiya’s holistic approach to sustainability, seamlessly integrating economic growth with environmental conservation and community upliftment. Through its efforts, the company has consistently demonstrated how a business can align profitability with purpose, leaving a profound and lasting impact on the ecosystems it nurtures and the lives it touches.

Elpitiya’s narrative of progress this year was beautifully articulated through its “Symphony of Sustainability: Touching Every Heart and Every Life”, an ode to its dedication to biodiversity and community well-being. This philosophy has guided the company in every endeavour, underscoring the intrinsic connection between its operations, the environment, and the people it serves.

Elpitiya Plantations said as it embarks on the next chapter of its journey, it remains resolute in its mission to redefine success in the plantation industry. By intertwining economic prosperity with environmental and social harmony, the company stands as a beacon of inspiration, demonstrating that true progress is not just about growth but about nurturing a legacy where business, biodiversity, and humanity coexist in perfect harmony.
