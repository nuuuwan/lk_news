Heavy showers expected in parts of the island

The Meteorology Department says showers or thundershowers will occur over most places of the Island during the afternoon or night.

Heavy showers of about 100 mm can be expected at some places in Central and Sabaragamuwa provinces and in Kurunegala, Kaluthara, Galle and Matara districts.

Showers may occur in Southern province and in Batticaloa and Ampara districts during the morning too, it added.

Thus the general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
