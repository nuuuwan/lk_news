India’s Adani drops US funding request for Sri Lanka terminal with JKH

ECONOMYNEXT – India’s Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Limited said it has withdrawn a funding request from the US International Development Corporation for its Colombo West International Terminal (CWIT) project in Sri Lanka.

“The project will be financed through the company’s internal accruals and capital management plan,” the company said in a filing on India’s Bombay Stock Exchange.

The CWIT is as joint venture with John Keells Holdings and Sri Lanka Ports Authority.

The US DFC said last year that it would finance the project through a 533 million dollar loan.

After charges were filed in the US including against Adani officials for misleading US investors about 250 million dollars in alleged bribery in a renewable energy project, the DFC said it was still conducting due diligence.
