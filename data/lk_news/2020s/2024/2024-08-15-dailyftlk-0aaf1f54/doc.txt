AICPA-CIMA’s CGMA Leadership Academy shapes future accounting, finance, and business leaders

Fourth edition of flagship leadership program is set to return to Kuala Lumpur in October 2024

The world’s premier finance and accounting body, AICPA-CIMA, together as the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants, will host the fourth edition of their flagship leadership program, the CGMA Leadership Academy, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, from 7-10 October under the theme “Transformative Leadership for a Sustainable Future.”

Over four days, Chartered Global Management Accountants (CGMA designation holders) will have access to curated content, high-profile speakers, live case study discussions, and knowledge-sharing roundtables on topics such as ‘ESG and business sustainability’, ‘digital transformation and AI’, ‘effective communication and interpersonal skills’, and ‘leadership and fostering resilience’.

This intensive program will enable attendees to gain new insights and develop the necessary skills to drive innovation, sustainable business performance, and growth within their organisations.

AICPA-CIMA Asia Pacific Regional Vice President Venkkat Ramanan said: “In today’s uncertain and complex business world, organisations need leaders with skills and capabilities different from those that enabled them to succeed in the past. This rapidly changing landscape demands that we foster leaders with innovative thinking, resilience, and a forward-looking approach to business strategy.”

“At AICPA-CIMA, we are committed to supporting future accounting, finance, and business leaders to develop the mindset, knowledge, and skills they need to stand out and propel their organisations forward. We have designed the program of this year’s CGMA Leadership Academy with this in mind, ensuring that attendees walk away with actionable insights and elite leadership skills to accelerate and lead in an ever-evolving business world,” he added.
