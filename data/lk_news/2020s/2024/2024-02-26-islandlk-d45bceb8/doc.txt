Babu…the star

The concert ‘The Legacy Of Clarence & Milton’, held at the Musaeus College Auditorium, on 16th Feb, was a resounding success for Babu Jayakanthan, the Prince of Tamil Pop, from Canada.

The audience, at this particular concert, was seeing Babu in action for the very first time and he impressed everyone present with his singing style and stage presentation.

He came in for high praise from many as he entertained the enthusiastic crowd with hits of A.E. Manoharan.

Sohan Weerasinghe was in the audience and had this to say… “Well done Babu. I enjoyed your songs and your moves!”

Another music lover commented…”Babu is one of the best entertainers I saw in the present; not only his singing but the way he carried himself; his interaction with the crowd; his humble gestures; a complete package of a jovial, heartwarming outburst is this gentleman Babu.”

Babu, who is well known in the music industry as Montreal Babu, started his music career, in 1985, in Sri Lanka.

He left for Canada last Sunday with an assurance that he would be back to entertain his fans in Sri Lanka.
