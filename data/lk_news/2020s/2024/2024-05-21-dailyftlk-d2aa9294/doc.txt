SLPP denies requesting President to call for Parliamentary elections first

SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam says party merely advised the President that prioritising general elections might be preferable

Highlights ongoing efforts to spread hatred against national leaders and says Parliamentary election is most effective to expose these tactics

Stresses ultimate decision lies with President Ranil Wickremesinghe and SLPP is ready to face any election

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam clarified yesterday that the SLPP has not formally requested President Ranil Wickremesinghe to hold Parliamentary elections first. Instead, Kariyawasam emphasised that the SLPP merely conveyed its viewpoint on polls to the President.

“According to legal provisions, the timing of the Presidential election is predetermined. The President holds the authority to dissolve Parliament at any point after two and a half years of its term. The decision to dissolve Parliament rests with the President,” said Kariyawasam during a press briefing.

Kariyawasam elaborated that SLPP founder Basil Rajapaksa had advised the President that prioritising the General election might be preferable. However, he stressed that the ultimate decision lies with the President, affirming the SLPP’s readiness to contest any upcoming elections, including Presidential, General, Local Government, or Provincial Council elections.

The General Secretary emphasised the party’s advocacy for parliamentary elections, citing a perceived distortion in society.

“There are ongoing efforts to instil hatred against the leaders who safeguarded our nation, with attempts to portray them as thieves,” he said. “A political faction is orchestrating these actions. We firmly believe that a Parliamentary election would be the most effective means to expose them.”

Responding to queries regarding ongoing support for President Wickremesinghe, Kariyawasam clarified that the SLPP’s commitment extends only until the conclusion of Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s term.

“We have not made any agreements beyond that period. The party will collectively determine the most suitable candidate for the Presidency, considering several potential candidates. We will announce our chosen candidate when the time is opportune,” he added.

He also criticised jibes aimed at the party, stating that while they haven’t selected a Presidential candidate yet, it’s noteworthy that they have several potential contenders, which he viewed as a positive development.
