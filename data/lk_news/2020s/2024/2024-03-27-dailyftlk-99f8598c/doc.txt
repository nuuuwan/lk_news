The Cabinet of Ministers approved the awarding of contracts for investors to establish solar photovoltaic power plants for six grid substations in Ampara, Habarana, Kosgama, Kurunegala, Pannala and Veyangoda.

The decision follows the recommendations put forth by the Cabinet-appointed Negotiation Committee, which evaluated the proposals submitted by relevant investors.

On 2 October 2023, the Cabinet approved awarding of contracts to supply 51 MW at five grid substations on build-own-operate (BOO) basis with an operational period of 20 years.

The grids will be developed under the Solar Photovoltaic Power Plant Installation Project for 70 MW with AC capacity ranging from 1-5 in 11 grid substations. It was also noted that proposals have been invited again for supply of 19 ME for the remaining six substations.
