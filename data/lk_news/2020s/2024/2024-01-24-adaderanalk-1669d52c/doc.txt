Controversial monk ‘Vishwa Buddha’ further remanded

The Colombo Magistrate’s Court has ordered to further remand in custody the saffron-robed monk, claiming to be ‘Vishwa Buddha’, until January 29, 2024.

He was presented before the Colombo Additional Magistrate this morning (Jan. 24), as per an order issued by the Gangodawila Magistrate’s Court in Nugegoda on Tuesday (Jan.21).

The suspect, who was out on bail, was re-arrested on Tuesday morning by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) over breach of bail conditions and was presented before the Gangodawila Magistrate’s Court.

Earlier, the monk was arrested on December 12 at a private establishment in Kalagedihena by the cybercrimes unit of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), acting on a complaint received against the self-styled monk who was residing in Ratnapura.

According to police, the saffron-robbed monk had allegedly issued statements demeaning Buddhism.

Meanwhile, the Sangha Sabha Committee of Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya recently unanimously decided to expel the controversial monk Ven. Ratnapure Wimalabuddha over allegedly issuing statements demeaning Buddhism.

In January, this decision was communicated to the Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs by the Chief Prelate (Mahanayaka Thero) of Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya, Most Venerable Makulewe Wimalabhidhana Thero.
