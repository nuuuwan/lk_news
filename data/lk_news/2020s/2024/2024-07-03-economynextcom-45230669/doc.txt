Most of this came from Windforce Plc (Rs140mn), and the share closed up at 20.50. “There was foreign buying from a fund that was active when Sri Lanka was on a better footing,” Softlogic Stockbrokers said.

Sampath Bank Plc was one of four crossings in the day. The local to local exchange contributed Rs268n to the day’s turnover. The share closed flat at 79.00.

“Activity from retail segment is yet to be seen. Local investors are continuing with the same mindset.”
