Ranil to skip General Election, focus on party leadership: Ruwan Wijewardene

United National Party (UNP) Deputy Leader Ruwan Wijewardene announced today that President Ranil Wickremesinghe will not be contesting in the upcoming General Election or seeking a seat in Parliament via the national list. The decision, according to Wijewardene, has been made by Wickremesinghe himself, but he will continue to provide crucial leadership to the UNP during the election campaign.

“Ranil Wickremesinghe has made the decision not to contest or enter Parliament through the national list in the forthcoming election,” Wijewardene confirmed, adding that despite this, Wickremesinghe will remain actively involved in guiding the party through this critical period.

This decision comes after Wickremesinghe’s significant defeat in the recent Presidential Election, where he suffered a crushing loss. In the aftermath, Wickremesinghe has been attempting to form a coalition with other political parties, but initial reactions from potential partners have reportedly been lukewarm, with many expressing reluctance to join forces with the UNP under his leadership.
