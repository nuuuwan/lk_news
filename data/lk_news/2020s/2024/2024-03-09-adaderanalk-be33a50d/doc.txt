SJB to boycott meeting convened by President with IMF delegates

The majority of the Members of Parliament representing the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) have reportedly decided not to participate the meeting with the representatives of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) convened by President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

This was revealed by the National Organizer of the SJB Tissa Attanayake today (March 09).

Joining a press briefing held today, MP Attanayake stated that however the party’s stance on the matter would be officially communicated later.

Attanayake further said that the IMF delegation, similar to the last time they were in Sri Lanka, would meet with and hold discussions with the opposition leader this time as well. He also pointed out that the SJB does not expect to take part in any discussions convened by the President to seek support for the government’s program.

President Wickremesinghe had extended an invitation to the party leaders representing the opposition in Parliament for a discussion with the IMF delegation on Monday (March 11) to offer a chance to discuss the global lender’s proposals.

The President’s Media Division (PMD) earlier said Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, National People’s Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leader S. Sridharan were invited to participate in these deliberations.

Additionally, an open invitation was extended to interested individuals to join alongside the invited leaders.
