Sri Lanka, Elite discuss training private security providers for employment abroad

ECONOMYNEXT – Representatives of Elite Academy, a UK-based private security service provider and training institute, met with Sri Lanka’s Labour and Foreign Employment Minister to discuss establishing a training center in the island, the minister said.

Talks were held about establishing a training centre “aimed at foreign employment opportunities in the security sector including in the United Arab Emirates,” Nanayakkara said on Meta.

Nanayakkara said he would provide state level support towards establishing such a center.

Elite Academy representatives “briefed the Minister on the benefits of establishing a training center for security service providers,” and the importance of only directing those properly trained for foreign employment opportunities in the security service sector.

Elite provides security, teacher training, health and social care, first aid, health and safety, conflict resolution, physical intervention, and specialist qualifications.

Since its foreign exchange crisis, Sri Lanka is now keen to increase its foreign worker remittances by upskilling its workers for jobs abroad.

Last November Nanayakkara drew flak for agreeing to send 10,000 workers to warmongering Israel.

Upskill soldiers to reduce future defense spending: Sri Lanka opposition MP

After a decades long civil war, Sri Lanka also has a surplus of military personnel, which it has already started “right sizing” gradually, a State Minister has said.

Sri Lanka is among the top 10 countries with highest ratio of soldiers to civilians, an opposition MP told parliament during last year’s budget debate, pointing out that the government’s defense spending should be re-examined as the economy progressed. (Colombo/Jan23/2024)
