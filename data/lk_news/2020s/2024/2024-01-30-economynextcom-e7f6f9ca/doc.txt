Sri Lanka to seek private investor for Mannar Island wind plant

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet of ministers has approved a proposal to seek private investment on a built operate own (BOO) basis to build a power plant with six wind turbines at a wind farm in Mannar Island, Minister Bandula Gunawardana said.

Sri Lanka was originally planning to build the turbines with a 47 million US dollar loan from the Asian Development Bank.

“Asian Development Bank funds cannot be used until the government’s foreign debt restructuring program is completed,” Cabinet spokesman Minister Bandula Gunawardena told reporters Tuesday.

“Accordingly the Cabinet of Ministers approved the proposal to implement the project on a BOO basis with private sector investors selected on a competitive basis with an operational period of 20 years.”

There have been concerns raised about giving projects to build renewable plants without competitive bidding. (Colombo/Jan30/2024)
