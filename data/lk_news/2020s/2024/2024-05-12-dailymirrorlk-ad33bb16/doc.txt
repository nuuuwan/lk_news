Maithripala resigns as SLFP Chairman, Wijeyadasa appointed as successor

Former President Maithripala Sirisena stepped down from his role as Chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) paving the way for a new leadership.

Accordingly, the Executive Committee of the SLFP convened for a crucial meeting at a hotel in Kotte today, where a unanimous decision was reached to appoint Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe as the new Chairman.

The executive committee's deliberations culminated amid a host of issues the party is facing at present.

Rajapakshe was appointed as the Acting Chairperson of the SLFP during an Executive Committee meeting held on April 21 by the party faction led by former President Maithripala Sirisena.

However, on April 24, the Colombo District Court issued an injunction order preventing Rajapakshe from functioning as the Acting Chairperson of the SLFP.

In response, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe filed a petition seeking to suspend the interim injunction, which the Court of Appeal (CA) dismissed on May 7th.
