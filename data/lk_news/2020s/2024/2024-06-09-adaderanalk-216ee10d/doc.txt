Sajith pledges to implement 13th Amendment

Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa assured that he will implement the 13th Amendment to the Constitution after coming to power.

The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leader stated this while participating in the occasion of donating a smart classroom to Bharathipuram Maha Vidyalayam, Kilinochchi, under the ‘Sakwala’ programme.

Speaking further, Sajith Premadasa urged everyone to join hands “as children of one mother,” regardless of their religions or race, to help rebuild the country.

Premadasa said that various leaders are afraid to speak about the 13th Amendment as they are “political opportunists”, and that he will implement the 13th Amendment as a “straight talker”.
