Public sector trade unions threaten walk out

Over 200 public sector trade unions, including Grama Niladhari officers and surveyors, will engage in a two-day strike by reporting ‘sick’ today and tomorrow.

In addition, teachers and principals will join the strike by reporting ‘sick’ tomorrow.

These trade unions are taking action based on several demands, including receiving a stipend of Rs. 25,000 regardless of service grade.

According to trade unions, due to the economic pressure caused by the increase in the cost of living and the tax burden, the allowance has been increased to Rs. 25,000 but is currently limited to officers in the executive service of the public sector.
