Highlighting the significance of prioritising the legal rights of the working community, Siyambalapitiya noted that initiating reforms within the plantation sector should commence by safeguarding the rights of employees.

The State Minister asserted that this initiative marks the first duty of the year, underscoring the importance of promptly addressing the longstanding issue.

He assured that necessary instructions have been provided to the Ministry Secretary to expedite the process.

Siyambalapitiya also sheds light on the extensive legal battles surrounding this matter, with over 2,000 lawsuits filed by employees.
