Siyambalapitiya assures timely payment to public sector employees

State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya assured that the Government is committed to ensuring timely salary payments for all public sector employees and implementing relief measures for low-income families.

“The increased sum of Rs. 10,000 for public servants will be incorporated into their April salaries as outlined in the 2024 Budget proposals,” he told Journalists in Ruwanwella.  He said measures are underway to make the payment before 10 April.

Highlighting the Government’s efforts to alleviate the financial burden on low-income families, Siyambalapitiya revealed plans to distribute rice to 2.8 million low-income families during April and May. Each family will receive 10 kilos of rice in both months, providing essential sustenance and relief during challenging times. He assured that 10 kilograms of rice allocated for next month would be distributed before 10 April.

The initiative aims to support low-income earners while also incentivising farmers to increase paddy cultivation, contributing to agricultural development.

Siyambalapitiya announced an increase in the pension amount, with pensioners set to receive the Rs. 2,500 from April onwards. The adjustment seeks to enhance the financial security of pensioners and improve their quality of life.
