Inland Revenue Department warns against fraudulent tax collection schemes

The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue has issued a warning to all taxpayers regarding fraudulent activities involving individuals impersonating Inland Revenue officers to collect money from business owners.

The Commissioner General emphasizes that all recovery of outstanding taxes, across all tax types managed by the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), will be conducted strictly through legal channels, with official written notifications being issued prior to any such actions.

In a statement, the IRD Commissioner General highlighted that it has come to the departmentâ€™s attention that a group of individuals is approaching business owners, falsely representing themselves as Inland Revenue officers and demanding payment.

Accordingly, he has made it clear that the Inland Revenue Department does not take responsibility for any payments made to these fraudulent individuals.

To address these incidents, the IRD has filed a formal complaint with the Sri Lanka Police, urging swift legal action to bring those responsible to justice, the statement added.

Taxpayers are advised not to make any payments to individuals claiming to collect taxes on behalf of the Inland Revenue Department. If there are any concerns regarding tax payments or other related issues, taxpayers are encouraged to visit the nearest regional or head office of the Inland Revenue Department for assistance, it added.
