Mystery surrounds inmate deaths at Magazine Prison

Colombo, May 08 (Daily Mirror)- Following the deaths of two inmates at the Magazine Prison allegedly after consuming a parcel of rice containing pork curry, the Department of Prisons has announced an internal investigation into the incident.

According to sources, the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) has issued an open verdict regarding their autopsies.

However, the bodies are slated to undergo further examination at the Medical Research Institute of Sri Lanka (MRI).

The deceased individuals, who were detained on charges of trafficking 'Ice' narcotics, were part of a group of approximately 15 inmates who had consumed the parcel of rice brought by relatives.

This led to three inmates being hospitalized at the National Hospital, Colombo for suspected food poisoning.

Subsequently, two of them succumbed to the illness, while another remains in a critical condition.

Despite the autopsies conducted on May 7, the exact cause of death remains undetermined, prompting questions and speculation among authorities and the public alike.
