Sri Lanka to revise high feed-in renewable tariffs after Mannar tender at 4.88 US cents

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will lower high feed in tariffs offered to renewable developers after low prices that has come in from a 50 MW tender for power plant in Mannar, Minister Wijesekera said.

“With the new competitive bids coming in, The Ministry of Power & Energy has already taken steps to revise the Feeding Tariff rates, Roof Top Solar Tariff rates,” Minister Wijesekera said a twitter.com message.

Formulas for negotiating renewable projects and economic indicators will also be revised, he said.

Two years ago the government raised roof top solar tariff from 22 rupees a unit to 37 rupees the feed-in tariff for ground mounted solar to 33 rupee a unit and wind to 30 to “encourage developers to continue in the sector,” he said.

At the time Sri Lanka’s rupee was in tatters, there were forex shortages, global wind and solar equipment prices were also high and domestic interest rates were high.

The tender for the Mannar plant came in on June 26, at 4.88 US cents (about 14.80 rupees at 305 to the US dollar).

A tender for 165MW small ground plants had come in at 15 to 29 rupees, Wijesekera said.

Administratively decided feed in tariffs have been controversial for many years, as small plants under competitive tender drew bids at low prices due to high competition, beating the conventional logic of ‘economies of scale’ as shown by the 165MW tender also.

The latest falls, Minister Wijesekera has attributed to economic stability that removed risk premia and other risks.
