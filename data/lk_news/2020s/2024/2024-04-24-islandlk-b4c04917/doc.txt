ComBank crowned ‘Best Bank in Sri Lanka’ by Global Finance for 22nd year

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has been named the ‘Best Bank in Sri Lanka’ for a remarkable 22nd year in the ‘World’s Best Banks 2024’ list released recently by the US-based Global Finance magazine.

Global Finance said its Best Bank Awards recognise financial institutions that offer the broadest range of services, long-term reliability, and technological innovation.

“The winners of this year’s awards are those banks that attended carefully to their customers’ needs in difficult markets and accomplished strong results while laying the foundations for future success,” the magazine said. “Winning organizations managed their assets and liabilities in a savvy way in light of the fast-changing interest rate scenarios.”

The 2024 edition of Global Finance’s list of 28 Best Banks in the Asia Pacific region names Commercial Bank alongside leading banks of the calibre of CBA (Australia), China Construction Bank (China), HSBC (Hong Kong), ANZ (New Zealand), UOB (Singapore), Hana Bank (South Korea), MUFG Bank (Japan), and State Bank of India (India), which were adjudged the best banks in their respective countries.
