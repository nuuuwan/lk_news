Sri Lanka - Thailand Free Trade Agreement signed

The historic Sri Lanka - Thailand Free Trade Agreement (SLTFTA) has been signed, a short while ago at the Presidential Secretariat in the presence of Prime Minister of Thailand Srettha Thavisin and President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Thai PM Thavisin arrived on the island earlier today (Feb.03) for a 2-day visit, accompanied by a high-level delegation. He is also scheduled to grace the national ceremony to mark the 76th Anniversary of the Independence of Sri Lanka as Guest of Honour.

The FTA is expected to bolster trade and investment ties between the two nations, and also promote deeper integration with the Asian economies.

Negotiations for the free trade agreement between Sri Lanka and Thailand resumed in November 2023 after being put on hold for 4 years consequent to the Covid-19 pandemic and ongoing restructuring of Sri Lanka’s state-owned entities.

The 9th round of the FTA negotiations was held from 18-20 December, 2023 while the previous round of talks had resulted in arriving at a consensus on rules of trade, services, investments and economic co-operation.

In late December, the Director General of Thai Commerce Department’s Department of Trade Negotiations Chotima Iemsawasdikul told media that Sri Lanka plays a significant role in maritime freight in the Indian Ocean, and it is home to abundant natural resources such as gemstones, graphite, and aquatic animals, adding that many industries in Thailand would benefit from the FTA, including those in the automotive, fashion, gems, metal, electronic items, machinery, rubber gloves, pet food, and corn.

The FTA will also benefit from service firms, including those in finance, insurance, tourism, and research and development.

From January to October 2023, the value of bilateral trade between Thailand and Sri Lanka was worth USD 320.37 million.

Thailand exported goods worth USD 213.49 million, while it imported goods worth USD 106.88 million from Sri Lanka.
