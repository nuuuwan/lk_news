US updates Sri Lanka travel advisory ahead of presidential election

The United States’ Department of State has updated its travel advisory for Sri Lanka urging citizens to exercise caution in view of the upcoming presidential election.

The advisory highlights that since Sri Lanka is set to hold presidential elections on September 21, 2024, demonstrations could occur before, during, or after the election.

“In some instances, police have used water cannons and tear gas to disperse protesters. U.S. citizens are reminded to avoid all gatherings, even peaceful ones, as such gatherings can turn violent with little or no warning”, it stated.

Furthermore, the US State Department has advised citizens traveling to Sri Lanka during this period to be aware of surroundings when traveling to tourist locations and crowded public venues, follow the instructions of local authorities, monitor local media for breaking events and adjust your plans based on new information and to avoid demonstrations and crowds.

With over 17 million registered voters across 22 electoral districts, Sri Lanka is gearing up for the much-awaited presidential polls on September 21, where 38 candidates are vying for the presidency.
