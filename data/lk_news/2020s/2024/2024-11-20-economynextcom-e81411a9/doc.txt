Sri Lanka plans confab to boost marine linked exports

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is holding a conference showcasing the island’s maritime business potential with over 40 foreign participants in November as a part of efforts to boost exports, newly appointed chairman of the island’s Export Development board said.

“We can market our county’s location to increase foreign currency inflows,” EDB Chairman Mangala Wijesinghe told reporters Wednesday.

“Nearly 200 ships go through Sri Lanka everyday and we are hoping to provide off shore services and create jobs out of it,” Wijesinghe said.

The forum called Voyage Sri Lanka 2024 will be held on November 26.

Sri Lanka is keen to promote sustainable use of ocean resources, marine and aquaculture services and strengthen its boat and shipbuilding industries, he said.

“We are popular to a certain extent [Sri Lanka as a global maritime hub], and we hope to spread it out with the help of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and EDB,” Director- Group Business Development for the Gulf Agency Company Ltd, Ricky Barnett said.

The forum will be held on November 26 at the Kingsbury Hotel in Colombo.

Participating agencies from Sri Lanka included Sri Lanka Ports Authority, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Board of Investment, Sri Lanka Navy, Marine Industries Association, Colombo Dockyard PLC, GAC group Sri Lanka, and CWIT (Colombo West International Terminal).
