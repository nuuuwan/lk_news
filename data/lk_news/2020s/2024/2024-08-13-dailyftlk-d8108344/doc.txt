Fcode Labs offers free QA masterclass for startup founders

Fcode Labs, a leading Health-Tech company, has announced a free online QA masterclass designed specifically for startup founders.

The masterclass will delve into the critical role of quality engineering in the early stages of product development and explore the benefits of a shift-left approach in an agile environment.

Scheduled for 14 August 6 p.m. CET, the masterclass will feature Udara Sembukuttiarachchi, a seasoned expert in the field of quality assurance. Attendees will gain valuable insights into how to implement effective quality control strategies from the outset, leading to faster time-to-market and improved product quality.

Faster Time-to-Market: Startups can accelerate product launch by promptly identifying and fixing issues by including quality assurance (QA) early in the development process.

Better Product Quality: Prompt fault identification and avoidance results in a better product, which raises customer happiness and retention.

Lower Costs: Resolving problems early in the development cycle saves a lot of money compared to doing it later on.

Enhanced Effectiveness: By encouraging cooperation between the QA and development teams, shift-left QA streamlines the entire development process.

Enhanced Customer Focus: Startups that put quality first from the start are better able to comprehend and cater to the needs of their customers.

“We understand the unique challenges faced by startup founders,” said Fcode Labs Co-CEO Tharindu Malawaraarachchi. “This masterclass aims to equip them with the knowledge and tools to build high-quality products from the ground up.”
