Sri Lanka to commence Mahaweli A, B zone development: president

ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka plans to commence development of the Mahaweli A and B zones in 2026, spanning a land area of 70,000 hectares in the formerly war-torn eastern province, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.

Speaking at an event held to mark the 82nd birth anniversary of late Minister Gamini Dissanayake on Wednesday March 20, Wickremesinghe said the government’s plan is to distribute some of the land to locals and part of it to agriculture corporations to develop the agrarian industry.

The Mahaweli project is the largest multipurpose national development programme in the history of Sri Lanka, targeting hydroelectric power generation, flood control, irrigation for dry zone cultivation, settlement of landless and unemployed families by constructing and developing the physical and social infrastructure required for human habitation by using the waters of the Mahaweli river, Sri Lanka’s longest flowing body of water. Increased agricultural production and employment generation were other objectives.

President Wickremesinghe said that due to Sri Lanka’s then-raging civil war, the A and B zones of the Mahaweli region could not be developed. (Colombo/Mar21/2024)
