SJB Lawyers Federation launches legal reforms for system change

Clarification: Do not make CC a puppet of Executive: PC Upul Jayasuriya

The following quote of the front page article under the title “Do not make CC a puppet of Executive: PC Upul Jayasuriya,” which was carried on Wednesday, February 14th Dailymirror print edition should be attributed to SJB leader Sajith Premadasa and it has been inadvertently attributed to Upul Jayasuriya PC, who is the head of the Samagi Lawyers Federation. We regret the error.

Former President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) Upul Jayasuriya PC said the President should not make the Constitutional Council a puppet of the executive but let it function independently on its own.

He said the President had made statements on several recent occasions indicating that the Constitutional Council was part of the executive and that it should function under the purview of the latter.

“We would like to remind the President that the Constitutional Council was established to control certain executive powers of the executive, thus it should not behave like a puppet,” he said.

The President's Counsel made these remarks recently whilst addressing a special gathering of lawyers from countrywide during the launch of the new legal framework of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, which was organised by the Samagi Lawyers Federation.

A compilation of 116 proposals named as Legal Reforms for System Change was recently launched by the Samagi Lawyers Federation with the participation of over 1,000 lawyers and senior counsels, which was presided over by the SJB leader and the Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa.

PC Upul Jayasuriya who was the head of the Samagi Lawyers Federation said that they propose these new resolutions for a better system change in the future.

Amongst the proposals were revitalizing judicial integrity by making the appointments and removals in a transparent manner, to expedite criminal prosecutions, to make Attorney General’s Department, Public Prosecutor and Public Defendant to be independent, empowering free expression, upholding justice and optimizing public finances.

He said there will be no more than one member from a family to take part in politics in the future as an effective solution to the problem of nepotism. If a second person from the same family wishes to join politics, that person has to wait until the first member retires.

PC Jayasuriya handed over the legal framework to the Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa at the event.
