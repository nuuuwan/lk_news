Election Commission slams election delay moves

The Election Commission has expressed strong dismay over any attempts to delay the upcoming Presidential and Parliamentary elections, insisting they proceed as scheduled.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, the Election Commission Chief R.M.A.L. Ratnayake said that the stance of the Commission has already been conveyed to the government that the presidential election should be held between September 17 and October 16 while the parliamentary election is slated for 2025.

“We are fully geared for the upcoming presidential election as funds have already been allocated,” he said.

Further, he said presidential election will be declared between the end of July and the early part of August.

In response to the recent statement by the United National Party (UNP) headed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe where it was suggested holding a referendum to extend the term of the President and Parliament for two more years, the Chairman stated that they had not been informed about holding a referendum.

"The Constitution clearly outlines the provisions for holding a referendum. However, it should not coincide with an election," he highlighted.

In a strong rebuke, the People's Action for Free & Fair Elections (PAFFREL) warned they would take legal action against any attempts to delay the elections.
