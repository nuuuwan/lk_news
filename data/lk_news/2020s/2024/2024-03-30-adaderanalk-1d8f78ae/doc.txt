At least 25 trains on Coastal Lines facing cancellations today

The Railway Department says that trains plying on the Coastal Line are continuing to experience further delays today (30) and tomorrow (31).

Trains operation between Wellawatta and Colombo Fort railway stations have been limited to a single track due to pipeline maintenance work carried out by the Urban Development Authority (UDA).

Owing to the situation, at least 25 train journeys on the Coastal Line are facing cancellations today, the department said further, adding that the disrupted train services are expected to be restored after tomorrow night.
