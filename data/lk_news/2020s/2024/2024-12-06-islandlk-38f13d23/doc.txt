Empowering women by celebrating men with Eva Sri Lanka’s #TellHim initiative

This International Men’s Day, Eva, Sri Lanka’s leading feminine hygiene brand, made history by celebrating the men who empower women. Launching the bold and heartfelt campaign #TellHim, Eva became the first feminine hygiene brand to honour men on this day. The campaign paid tribute to the quiet champions—fathers, brothers, husbands, friends, and colleagues—who support women to lead with confidence and break barriers.

Developed in partnership with the creative agency DEFY, the #TellHim campaign resonated deeply with audiences, amassing over half a million views across digital platforms in just days. Featuring real stories and heartfelt messaging, the initiative inspired thousands of comments, shares, and stories of gratitude, creating a nationwide conversation about shared empowerment.

“Commenting on the success of the campaign, Lavanya Kathiresanathan, Assistant Brand Manager at Eva, stated, “Support often works quietly in the background, but its impact is profound. With #TellHim, we aimed to celebrate the men who uplift and empower, encouraging people to express gratitude and foster a culture of mutual respect.”
