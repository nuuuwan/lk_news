Several spells of light showers expected in parts of the island

The Meteorology Department says severalÂ  spells of light showers will occur in Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern and North-western provinces and in Kandy and Nuwara-Eliya districts.

Showers or thundershowers may occur at a few places in Eastern and Uva Provinces during the evening or night.

Fairly strong winds of about 30-40 kmph can be expected at times over Northern, North-central and North-western provinces and in Hambantota district, it added.

Thus the general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
