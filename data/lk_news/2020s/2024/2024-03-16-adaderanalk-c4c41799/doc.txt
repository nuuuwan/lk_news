Hot, dry weather expected in many parts of the island today

Showers or thundershowers may occur at a few places in Western, Sabaragamuwa and Central provinces and in Galle and Matara districts in the evening or at night, the Department of Meteorology says.

Misty conditions can be expected at some places in Sabaragamuwa, Central and Uva provinces and in Galle and Matara districts in the morning.

Meanwhile, in an advisory issued last evening, the Meteorology Department cautioned that high atmospheric temperatures would prevail in North Central, North Western and Eastern provinces as well as in Colombo, Gampaha, Monaragala, Mannar, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya and Hambantota districts today.

Accordingly, the heat index, the temperature felt on human body, is likely to go up to ‘Caution Level’ in aforementioned areas.

Under this level of temperature, fatigue is possible with prolonged exposure and activity, and continuing activity could result in heat cramps.

The members of the public are urged to stay hydrated, take breaks in the shade while outside, limit strenuous outdoor activities and wear lightweight and white/light coloured clothing.
