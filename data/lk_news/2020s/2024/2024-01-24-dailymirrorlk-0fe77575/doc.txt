’’There was no gold-plated camel at daughter’s house’’: Maithri

Parliament, Jan. 24 (Daily Mirror)- Refuting reports that there was a gold-plated camel in his daughter's house, former President Maithripala Sirisena told Parliament that only a personal gift given by the Emir of Qatar was kept at the said residence.

“The official gift I received from the Emir of Qatar is kept in the museum at Polonnaruwa. Some of my staff members including security personnel received wrist watches worth more than Rupees one million from the Emir. I also got a personal gift and I kept it at my daughter’s house,” MP Sirisena said.

“ A person who reads newspapers reports on a national TV station commented on the media reports of the robbery at my daughter’s residence in an unfounded manner and questioned as to why I kept the official gift which I have received at my daughter’s residence,” he said.

He said robbers had only taken some food stuff from his daughter’s house although it was sensationalized by the media,

“Both social media and mainstream media act in an uncivilized manner. Therefore there is a dire need to regulate all media. However the laws introduced through the Online Safety Bill is too draconian and has to be amended,” he also said.
