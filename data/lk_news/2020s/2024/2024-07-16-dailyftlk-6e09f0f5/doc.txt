Karu reminds ECSL of duty to call for timely elections

The National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ), led by former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in a statement has reminded the Election Comission of Sri Lanka (ECSL) of its duty to call for timely elections.

“As per the powers granted by the Constitution of Sri Lanka, the Election Commission is required to hold the Presidential election in 2024. An official announcement for the election must be issued as soon as the ECSL is empowered to call for elections to ensure a fair process,” Jayasuriya said yesterday.

Jayasuriya said the request is being made as Sri Lanka approaches the time to elect a President, noting that contradictory statements and unethical proposals are being disseminated in society.

“Due to such conflicting opinions and unnecessary debates, the country’s economy may face challenges. Different attitudes arising between international commercial and financial institutions could create conditions harmful to the country’s well-being,” he said.

He added that the unnecessary debates in Parliament, as well as actions taken by certain individuals through various petitions before the Supreme Court, are creating unrest in society.

“We strongly believe that the immediate implementation of the responsibilities and functions assigned to the Election Commission within its constitutional powers is essential, considering the potential impact of such an environment on society in general.” he said.
