Wijeyadasa’s petition against enjoining order fixed for consideration

The Court of Appeals ordered a petition filed seeking to invalidate the recent order issued by the Colombo District Court preventing Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from functioning as the Acting Chairman of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), to be taken up for consideration on May 02.

This petition was filed by Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe.

On Wednesday (24), the Colombo District Court issued an injunction order preventing the appointment of Minister Wijeyadasa as the Acting Chairman of the SLFP.

The court has also issued an injunction order preventing MP Sarathie Dushmantha Mithrapala from functioning as the General Secretary of SLFP.

Meanwhile, the court issued another injunction preventing the implementation of the decisions taken by the SLFP Acting General Secretary.

The Colombo District Judge issued these injunctions after considering a plaint submitted by Ministers Mahinda Amaraweera, Lasantha Alagiyawanna and Member of Parliament Duminda Dissanayake.

It was mentioned in the order that these injunctions will remain in effect until May 08, 2024.

Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was appointed as the Acting Chairman of SLFP during an executive committee meeting held on April 21, by the party’s faction led by former President Maithripala Sirisena.
