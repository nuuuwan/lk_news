“Ganemulla Sanjeewa” moved to Boossa Prison

The Gampaha Magistrate’s Court has ordered for the notorious drug trafficker and organized criminal infamously known as “Ganemulla Sanjeewa”, who is currently under detention orders, to be moved to the Boossa Prison.

Accordingly, he was ordered to be detained in the Boossa Prison until June 24.

This order was issued when the suspect was produced before Gampaha Magistrate Silani Perera this morning (10).

The underworld figure was detained at the Weeragula Police Station under detention orders obtained by the Colombo North Crimes Division under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).

“Ganemulla Sanjeewa” was arrested at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake upon his return from Nepal on September 13, 2023.

He had a forged passport in his possession at the time of his arrest, with personal details of a female believed to be a resident of the Dematagoda area.

“Ganemulla Sanjeewa”, who is believed to have illegally entered India by boat, had reportedly later fled to Nepal, and subsequently returned to Sri Lanka upon the issuance of an international ‘Red Warrant’ for his arrest.
