Patients bear the brunt as health strike continues

Colombo, May 13 (Daily Mirror)  -  Patients have been highly inconvenienced due to the health strike launched by health professionals in all government hospitals at provincial level.

The strike which commenced on May 09 targeting seven provinces has crippled healthcare services at respective hospitals. Today, the strike was launched at Central Province from 8am to 12 noon while the strike will affect hospitals in the Sabaragamuwa Province tomorrow (14).

The Health Trade Union Alliance confirmed its intention to spread the strike to other provinces in the coming days if their demands are not met. Among the key issues prompting the strike are demands for higher allowances, particularly for a diverse range of health professionals. These include radiology and laboratory technicians, pharmacists, midwives, dental surgeons, public health inspectors and entomology officers.

The dispute traces back to a recent decision by the Cabinet, led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, to approve a proposal doubling the Doctors’ Annual Training (DAT) allowance for government sector doctors. This move, raising the allowance from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000, has fueled discontent among other health sector professionals who feel that their contributions have been overlooked.
