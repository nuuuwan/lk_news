Sarath Fonseka to be axed from SJB chairmanship

Colombo, Feb 16 (Daily Mirror) - Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) is to expel its MP Sarath Fonseka from the post of party chairman shortly over his latest remarks affecting the party politically, a source said.

A source close to party leader Sajith Premadasa, said expulsion will be done very soon. Asked whether he will be removed from the party, he said it will lead to a process involving litigation but the party leader has the discretion to expel him from chairmanship.

MP Fonseka has been openly critical of the SJB and its leadership despite warnings. Recently, Mr. Fonseka held talks with President Ranil Wickremesinghe triggering speculation that he will join the government at any time.
