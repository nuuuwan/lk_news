‘Sarvajana Balaya’ ready to launch Presidential Election campaign – Dilith Jayaweera

Leader of the Mawbima Janatha Party (MJP) Dilith Jayaweera says that the ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ alliance is fully prepared to launch its Presidential Election campaign.

Speaking to the media during the inauguration of the MJP’s Galle District office, the entrepreneur expressed that the alliance ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ has emerged as the primary alternative for the people of Sri Lanka, representing the ideology of leftist nationalism.

“We are the sole political faction championing leftist nationalism. All other parties have united under the banner of right-wing liberalism. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sajith Premadasa, and Anura Kumara Dissanayaka are all aligned with this ideology”, Jayaweera highlighted.

“While they traverse that path, we offer a distinct alternative for the people of our nation”, he added.

Meanwhile, in response to a question raised by a journalist how the MJP is prepared for the upcoming presidential election, the MJP leader said: “We are fully prepared to launch our political campaign immediately as the alliance ‘Sarvajana Balaya’”.

The inauguration ceremony of the Mawbima Janatha Party’s Galle District Office took place today, attended by party leader Dilith Jayaweera, Senior Leader Dr. Hemakumara Nanayakkara, and several other senior members of the party.
