‘Happy Hour’ controversy:Historical roots, economic benefits, and social enjoyment

According to a report published in The Island on 01 June, 2024, the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA) has issued a directive to hotels to immediately cease offering discounts on purchasing alcohol products. This directive emphasises that such promotional offers are punishable under current regulations.

NATA Chairman Dr. Alan Ludowyke explained that his organisation had received numerous complaints about hotels, with liquor licences, offering discounts on alcohol products. Those complaints specifically highlight promotions like ‘Happy Hour’ discounts—alcoholic beverages are sold at reduced prices for a limited time to attract more customers.

To better understand the issue surrounding ‘Happy Hour’’ promotions, it is essential to consider who the primary consumers of these hotel promotions are. Are they locals or tourists? Most of the patrons are likely to be tourists. The concept and practice of ‘Happy Hour’ are familiar to tourists, as they are commonly practised in many countries.

The data highlights the significant growth in tourism in Sri Lanka compared to the previous year, noting a substantial increase in foreign arrivals. There has been a remarkable increase in the number of foreign tourists visiting Sri Lanka, with a growth of 261.2% year-on-year in August 2023 compared to August 2022. This indicates a strong recovery, or surge, in international tourism. This growth rate signifies a significant improvement, suggesting that Sri Lanka has become a more attractive destination for foreign tourists, potentially due to better marketing, improved political stability, enhanced infrastructure, or other favourable conditions. There is no reliable published data on the number of local tourists staying in hotels in Sri Lanka.

This suggests a gap in the available tourism data, making it difficult to accurately assess the domestic tourism market. It is assumed that the number of local tourists staying in hotels is much less than foreign tourists. It is estimated to be around 10%. This assumption could be based on anecdotal evidence or observations from industry stakeholders. To get a better understanding of the concept of ‘Happy Hour’ and how it’s being used, we need to explore the history of the concept, and its origin and practice.

The term ‘Happy Hour’ has its roots in American naval slang from the 1920s, a period following the conclusion of the First World War. During this time, life on naval ships was often monotonous and gruelling, with sailors enduring long stretches at sea, away from the comforts and diversions of shore life. To mitigate the tedium and boost morale, the Navy introduced designated periods known as ‘Happy Hours’.

These ‘Happy Hours’ were intervals during which sailors could participate in various recreational activities, providing them with a much-needed break from their routine duties. The activities included playing cards, engaging in sports, and enjoying music and theatrical performances. This initiative aimed to relieve the sailors from the drudgery and mental strain of their demanding environment, fostering camaraderie and improving overall well-being among the crew.

The concept was so effective that it eventually transcended its military origins, finding its way into civilian life. The term ‘Happy Hour’ gradually evolved to represent any scheduled period of leisure and relaxation, particularly in the context of social gatherings involving food and drink. Today, while its maritime origins may be largely forgotten, the essence of ‘Happy Hour’ as a time to unwind and enjoy oneself remains intact, providing a welcome respite from the rigors of daily life.

For many, the 5 o’clock ‘Happy Hour’ is considered the cornerstone of American working life. This daily ritual, deeply ingrained in the culture, offers a much-needed respite from the stress and demands of the workday. Whether an office worker in a bustling city or a tradesperson in a small town, heading to the bar for ‘Happy Hour’ symbolises a moment of luxury and relaxation; it is a time to loosen the proverbial tie, unwind, and engage in social interactions over a craft beer, a well-mixed cocktail, or even a glass of wine.

Typically held between 4 pm and 8 pm, ‘Happy Hours’ have evolved beyond their origins as mere drink specials. They serve a dual purpose: allowing workers to relax and socialise and giving bars and restaurants a chance to boost their sales during what would otherwise be slower weekday shifts. By offering discounted drinks and appetizers, these establishments attract a diverse crowd eager to decompress and enjoy themselves before heading home or continuing their evening plans.

‘Happy Hour’ has become more than just a marketing strategy; it is a social institution. For many, it represents a communal experience where colleagues can bond, friendships can be forged, and the day’s stresses can be momentarily forgotten. The ambiance during ‘Happy Hour’ is typically more laid-back and convivial, contrasting with the more formal or business-like atmosphere that characterises the daytime.

In urban areas, ‘Happy Hours’ often cater to a wide range of tastes, with many bars and restaurants offering themed nights, live music, and innovative drink menus to attract patrons. This variety ensures something for everyone, whether one prefers a quiet corner in a cozy pub or a vibrant scene in a trendy cocktail bar. The popularity of ‘Happy Hour’ has also led to the rise of specialised establishments, such as craft beer bars and wine bars, each offering unique experiences tailored to specific preferences.

Beyond individual enjoyment, ‘Happy Hours’ contribute to the local economy by driving foot traffic and increasing revenue for hospitality businesses. This influx of patrons during off-peak hours helps stabilize income for these establishments, ensuring they can thrive even during slower periods. In many ways, ‘Happy Hours’ have become a win-win situation: workers get well-deserved relaxation, and businesses benefit from the additional custom. Ultimately, the 5 o’clock ‘Happy Hour’ embodies a quintessential aspect of American working life, blending relaxation, socialisation, and economic benefit. It highlights the importance of balance between work and leisure, reminding everyone that amidst the hustle and bustle of daily life, there is always time to unwind and get happy before dinnertime commences.

During the same period, the United States was experiencing Prohibition, a largely unsuccessful attempt to ban the sale and consumption of alcohol. Naturally, Americans found ways to circumvent these restrictions, leading them to clandestine speakeasies, where they could enjoy beer or liquor before dinner. The term ‘Happy Hour’ emerged to describe those illicit gatherings.

Today, frequenting bars for ‘Happy Hours’ is legal and has become a cherished tradition enjoyed by men and women across the United States. This social ritual spans a variety of venues, from upscale dining restaurants to cozy craft beer pubs, offering a diverse range of cocktails and select craft beers designed to help patrons unwind and ease into the workweek. The appeal of ‘Happy Hours’ lies not only in the discounted prices but also in the opportunity they provide for socializing and relaxation after a long day.

Patrons’ beverage preferences during ‘Happy Hours’ reflect a broad spectrum of tastes. According to a 2014 survey, beer emerged as the most popular choice, with 41% of respondents favouring it. Wine followed closely, with 31% of people preferring it, while 28% opted for hard liquor. These preferences highlight the diverse drinking culture that ‘Happy Hours’ cater to, ensuring there is something for everyone.

In 2022, the craft brewing industry significantly contributed to the US economy, amounting to $72.2 billion. This impressive economic impact underscores the vital role that small and independent American craft brewers play in the nation’s financial health. The influence of craft breweries extends far beyond producing unique and flavourful beers; they are pivotal drivers of state and local economies, fostering job creation and community development.

The nearly 460,000 jobs generated by the craft brewing industry highlight its importance as a source of employment. These jobs span various roles, from brewers and quality control specialists to marketing professionals and sales representatives. Moreover, the industry supports numerous ancillary sectors, including agriculture, distribution, hospitality, and retail. The demand for locally sourced ingredients, such as hops and barley, stimulates agricultural production and benefits farmers. Meanwhile, the need for distribution services creates opportunities for logistics and transportation companies.

Craft breweries also contribute to the vibrancy of their communities by attracting tourists and locals alike to taprooms and brewpubs. These establishments often become social hubs, hosting events, live music, and festivals that draw crowds and generate additional revenue for surrounding businesses. The presence of a successful craft brewery can revitalise a neighbourhood, spurring economic development and increasing property values.

The economic ripple effect of the craft brewing industry is substantial. For every dollar spent on craft beer, a significant portion circulates back into the local economy, supporting other businesses and creating a multiplier effect. This economic activity helps to sustain local suppliers, artisans, and service providers, further embedding craft breweries within the fabric of their communities.

Overall, the craft brewing industry’s $72.2 billion contribution to the US economy in 2022 is a testament to the resilience and innovation of small and independent brewers. Their ability to adapt to changing market demands, coupled with a commitment to quality and community, ensures that craft breweries will continue to play a crucial role in the economic landscape for years to come.

This growth reflects a broader trend towards artisanal and locally produced beverages, which offer unique flavours and brewing techniques that appeal to a discerning consumer base. As a result, many bars and pubs have embraced this trend, featuring extensive craft beer selections during their ‘Happy Hour’ specials to attract beer enthusiasts and connoisseurs alike. In essence, ‘Happy Hours’ have become a significant aspect of American social life, providing an enjoyable and legal way for people to relax and socialize. The variety of drinks ensures everyone can find something to enjoy, making these gatherings a staple of the American workweek.

‘Happy Hour’ isn’t solely about drinks; it also features an array of enticing food specials, particularly in craft beer restaurants. These establishments often pair their wide selection of brews and mixed drinks with various appetizers and meals designed to complement the beverages and enhance the overall experience. Among the most popular ‘Happy Hour’ eats, one item stands out above the rest: burgers.

The enduring popularity of burgers is reflected in American eating habits, with the average American devouring nearly 50 billion burgers each year. This high demand makes burgers a staple on ‘Happy Hour’ menus nationwide. Bars and restaurants frequently offer special deals on burgers during these hours, drawing in patrons eager to enjoy a hearty meal alongside their discounted drinks.

Craft beer restaurants, in particular, have elevated the humble burger to new heights, experimenting with gourmet ingredients, unique flavour combinations, and artisanal preparation methods. These establishments might serve burgers made from premium beef, topped with creative ingredients, like truffle aioli, caramelized onions, or avocado. They may also offer alternative options such as veggie burgers, chicken burgers, or exotic meat varieties to cater to diverse dietary preferences.

In addition to burgers, many ‘Happy Hour’ menus feature other popular food items like sliders, wings, nachos, and flatbreads. These dishes are designed to be shared, encouraging a social dining experience where friends and colleagues can sample a variety of flavours while enjoying their drinks. Combining food and drink specials creates an inviting atmosphere, encouraging patrons to linger, socialize, and thoroughly enjoy their time.

The strategic inclusion of food specials during ‘Happy Hour’ enhances customer satisfaction and boosts revenue for bars and restaurants. By offering appealing food options, establishments can attract a broader audience, including those who might only typically visit for drinks with others. This approach ensures that ‘Happy Hour’ is a well-rounded experience, catering to patrons’ culinary and social desires.

In summary, ‘Happy Hour’ has become more than just a time for discounted drinks. It has become a culinary event in its own right, with craft beer restaurants leading the charge by offering delicious food specials, particularly the ever-popular burger. This combination of great food and drink ensures that ‘Happy Hour’ remains a cherished and anticipated part of the American social landscape.

‘Happy Hour’ promotions offer several advantages for hotels, contributing to increased revenue, customer satisfaction, and overall business growth. Here are some key benefits:

‘Happy Hour’ promotions can significantly boost a hotel’s revenue during off-peak hours. By attracting guests with discounted drinks and food, hotels can fill their bars and restaurants during times that would otherwise see low patronage.

Offering ‘Happy Hour’ deals can attract new customers and encourage repeat visits. Guests who enjoy the ‘Happy Hour’ experience are likely to return, potentially becoming loyal patrons. Positive word-of-mouth and social media sharing can further enhance this effect.

‘Happy Hours’ provide an enjoyable and relaxed atmosphere for guests, enhancing their overall experience at the hotel. This positive experience can contribute to higher customer satisfaction and better reviews, which are crucial for a hotel’s reputation.

While ‘Happy Hours’ often focus on discounted drinks, they also boost food sales. Guests are likely to order appetizers, snacks, or even meals alongside their beverages, increasing the overall spend per customer.

‘Happy Hour’ can serve as an opportunity to promote other hotel services and amenities. For instance, guests who come for ‘Happy Hour’ might decide to book a room, make a reservation at the hotel’s restaurant, or use other facilities, like the spa or fitness centre.

‘Happy Hour’ deals can attract a diverse range of customers, including locals, business travellers, and tourists. This variety can help hotels build a broad and varied customer base, reducing reliance on a single demographic.

For hotels located in communities, ‘Happy Hour’ can serve as a way to build relationships with local residents. By becoming a popular spot for locals, hotels can strengthen community ties and ensure a steady stream of local customers.

In a competitive market, offering an attractive ‘Happy Hour’ can differentiate a hotel from its competitors. Unique ‘Happy Hour’ deals and a vibrant atmosphere can make a hotel stand out, drawing guests away from other establishments.

‘Happy Hour’ helps in maximizing the utilization of staff and resources. By increasing foot traffic during slower periods, hotels can ensure that their staff is productively engaged, leading to better overall efficiency and reduced idle time.

‘Happy Hour’ promotions provide an opportunity to test new menu items or drinks at a lower risk. Feedback gathered during these times can be invaluable for refining offerings before fully integrating them into the standard menu.

‘Happy Hour’ promotions offer hotels a strategic tool to enhance revenue, improve customer satisfaction, and strengthen their market position. By leveraging the advantages of ‘Happy Hour’, hotels can create a dynamic and appealing environment that attracts a diverse clientele and encourages repeat business. These promotions typically offer discounted prices on drinks and food during specific hours, creating an incentive for guests to visit the hotel’s bar or restaurant during off-peak times. This can lead to increased overall sales as guests may stay longer and purchase additional items at full price.

In the Sri Lankan context, implementing ‘Happy Hour’ promotions can significantly boost revenue from foreign tourists. Sri Lanka, known for its scenic beauty and cultural heritage, attracts a large number of international visitors. By offering attractive ‘Happy Hour’ deals, hotels can enhance the overall experience for these tourists, encouraging them to spend more time and money within the hotel premises. This not only increases the hotel’s revenue but also enhances the country’s reputation as a tourist-friendly destination.

However, if the practice of ‘Happy Hour’ is discontinued, it could adversely affect the tourism industry in Sri Lanka. ‘Happy Hours’ are popular among tourists who look for ways to relax and socialise during their travels. Eliminating these promotions could lead to a decrease in the number of visitors frequenting hotel bars and restaurants, resulting in lower sales and reduced customer satisfaction. The absence of ‘Happy Hour’ deals might also drive tourists to seek alternatives outside the hotel, leading to a potential loss of revenue for the hotel industry.

To mitigate these negative impacts, the government should consider restricting ‘Happy Hour’ participation to foreign tourists. This targeted approach would ensure that the benefits of ‘Happy Hour’ promotions are retained for the tourism sector without affecting the local population. By implementing policies that cater specifically to foreign tourists, the government can support the hotel industry in maximising its revenue while maintaining a balance with local regulations and cultural norms.

In conclusion, ‘Happy Hour’ promotions are a valuable tool for hotels to enhance their appeal and profitability. In Sri Lanka, these promotions can significantly boost revenue from foreign tourists, contributing to the overall growth of the tourism industry. Rather than eliminating ‘Happy Hours’, the government should consider policies that restrict their availability to foreign tourists, ensuring that the benefits are retained while addressing any potential concerns.
