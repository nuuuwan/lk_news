Art enthusiasts and cultural admirers in Northern Sri Lanka have the unique opportunity to immerse themselves in

the rich tapestry of Tamil Christian art and architecture at the ‘Cultural Mosaic’ exhibition. Curated by Sagara Jayasinghe, a Senior Lecturer at the Department of Integrated Design, University of Moratuwa, and Research Fellow at the ARTIS Institute of the Faculty of Humanities of the University of Lisbon, this thematic poster exhibition unveils the fascinating convergence of 19th Century Tamil Christian Art and Architecture in Northern Sri Lanka. The venue for this cultural event is the Art Gallery of the Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Jaffna. The exhibition which began on January 30 will continue until February 9.

The backdrop of the exhibition is rooted in the historical and cultural landscape of Northern Sri Lanka, where the 19th-century Tamil Christian Art and Architecture laid the foundation for a unique regional identity. Influenced and fortified by traditional Hindu religious practices, this phenomenon gave rise to a distinctive blend of art, architecture, folklore, and rituals.The heart of the exhibition lies in its vibrant posters, each narrating a story of Hindu-Catholic encounters, cross-cultural responsiveness evident in places of worship, and the architectural models and interior elements linked to the Cochin and Malabar traditions of India and the vernacular architecture of Northern Sri Lanka. The tapestry of intercultural integration comes alive through sacred images, religious paintings, and liturgical fixtures that encapsulate the essence of the unexposed Tamil Christian artistic phenomenon.

As visitors walk through the exhibition, they will be captivated by colourful stories that bridge the gap between the remnants of the past and present-day distractions. Architect Jayasinghe, the visionary behind this cultural journey, has meticulously crafted an experience that transcends time, allowing viewers to delve into the layers of history and heritage that define the Tamil Christian artistic expression.

The exhibition, inaugurated on January 29 by the Vice Chancellor of the University of Jaffna, Prof. S.Srisathunarajah, corresponded with the opening session of the International Conference on “Tamil Christian Art Worlds.” This collaborative effort between the Department of Fine Arts of the University of Jaffna and the Post Graduate and Research Department of Folklore of St. Xavier’s College, Tamil Nadu, South India, sets the stage for an exploration of the intricate connections between art, religion, and culture. The exhibition is supported by the Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, I.P., within the scope of the ARTIS-IHA Base Funding project.

Architect Jayasinghe, the driving force behind the “Cultural Mosaic”, is a practising architect and a fellow member of the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects. With a research focus on cultural heritage, missionary movements, and ecclesiastical art and architecture in Sri Lanka, Jayasinghe has established himself as a leading expert in the field. His dedication is evident through a decade of contributions, including published books, exhibitions, conference papers, public lectures, and journal articles in both local and global contexts. He was currently serving as the Honourary Secretary of the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) Sri Lanka and an Expert Member of the ICOMOS International Scientific Committee on Places of Religion and Ritual.

In conclusion, the “Cultural Mosaic” exhibition is an invitation to embark on a journey through time, culture, and art. It is a celebration of the intricate threads that weave together the diverse elements of Tamil Christian artistic expression, creating a tapestry that reflects the resilience and beauty of cultural integration of the island’s northern region.
