Steps to accelerate development of Port of Galle resolving environmental and wildlife issues

The Ministry of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation has formulated plans for the development of the Port of Galle into a tourist port.

The plans entail the construction of two backwaters, measuring 850 m and 150 m respectively. Additionally, the harbour basin will be dredged to a depth of 12.05 m, and a new passenger terminal will be built.

To address environmental and wildlife concerns associated with these constructions, a special meeting was convened on 2 May, initiated by Ports, Shipping, and Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva and with the participation of the Wildlife, Forest Resources Conservation, and Irrigation Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi, and Health and Industries Minister Ramesh Pathirana.

Minister de Silva pointed out that delays in the construction at the Port of Galle were due to ineffective measures in addressing environmental and wildlife issues. It was proposed that the Department of Wildlife submit an Environmental Impact Assessment Report within one week. Furthermore, the Minister instructed officials of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) to call for Requests of Interest from both local and foreign investors interested in contributing to the development project based on the aforementioned report.

Minister Wanniarachchi directed officials of the Department to expedite the submission of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report within one week, ensuring the resolution of all environmental issues to facilitate the development program at the Port of Galle.

The Ministry of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation underscores that a total of $ 200 million will be allocated by SLPA for the development program at the Port of Galle.
