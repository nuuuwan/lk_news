Public resource misuse sparks over 750 complaints to TISL

The Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) said yesterday it has received 758 complaints concerning the misuse of public resources for election campaigning as of 1 September.

It said the largest category of complaints—343 in total—pertains to the misuse of public premises. These include the misuse of public grounds, Government offices, buildings, and schools etc. for election campaigns. Complaints detail instances where such premises were used without paying the required fees, were reserved for one candidate or political party for extended periods or were adorned with posters and cutouts in violation of election laws.

The second-highest category of complaints (117) relates to the misuse of public officers, their skills, knowledge, and working hours for political propaganda. TISL has received reports with evidence indicating that public officers, including senior officials with limited political rights, have been actively campaigning for political parties or candidates. These activities have taken place both in person and on social media, in violation of election laws.
