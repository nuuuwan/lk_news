UNP decides to contest all upcoming elections only under ‘elephant’ symbol

A special discussion on the future political direction of the United National Party (UNP) was held this morning (16) under the leadership of the party’s leader, former President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Several former UNP Members of Parliament participated in the meeting.

The discussion reportedly focused on the party’s strategy for the upcoming elections, with an emphasis on contesting under the ‘elephant’ symbol.

Speaking to the media following the meeting, UNP Chairman and former MP Vajira Abeywardena confirmed that the party plans to contest all upcoming elections under the ‘elephant’ symbol.

Abeywardena stated that this decision was made to strengthen the stability of the party and reinforce its direction as the party moves forward.

The United National Party, one of Sri Lanka’s oldest political parties, has a longstanding association with the ‘elephant’ symbol, which has been central to its identity and voter recognition.
