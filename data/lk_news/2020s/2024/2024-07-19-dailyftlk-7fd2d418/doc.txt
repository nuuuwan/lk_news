SDIG Nilantha Jayawardene sent on compulsory leave

The National Police Commission (NPC) has decided to place Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police Nilantha Jayawardene on compulsory leave, effective from 18 July. Jaywardene currently is the Senior DIG in charge of Administration.

According to NPC sources, the senior police officer is being placed on compulsory leave to facilitate a disciplinary inquiry against him concerning the Easter Sunday terror attack.

This sudden decision follows recent scrutiny from the Supreme Court, which questioned why no action had been taken against the former SIS head as mandated by court orders regarding his role in the failure to prevent the 2019 terrorist attack that claimed the lives of 253 people and injured many more. Last week, the Supreme Court directed the NPC to adhere to its order and take action against Senior DIG Nilantha Jayawardene.

The Senior DIG, along with former President Maithripala Sirisena and several other top officials, has been accused of negligence in preventing the Easter Sunday 2019 terrorist attack, despite receiving critical intelligence information. He was ordered to pay Rs. 75 million in compensation to victims.
