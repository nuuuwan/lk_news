Bird flu: Sri Lanka bars import of animals and animal products from affected countries

Sri Lanka’s Department of Animal Production and Health (DAPH) has emphasized that it will not allow the import of animals and animal products from any country where cases of bird flu have been reported.

Dr. Hemali Kothalawala, Director General of DAPH, stated that steps and measures have been implemented to prevent the entry of the Avian Influenza A(H5N1) virus (or “bird flu”), which has recently resurfaced in several countries.

Pointing out that she is frequently asked by the media regarding this issue, Dr. Kothalawala clarified that no animals or animal products will be permitted for importation into Sri Lanka from countries where bird flu cases have been reported.

She also highlighted a serious new development, where cattle in the United States have been afflicted with avian influenza virus for the first time.

Despite this concerning situation, Dr. Kothalawala assured that the disease control measures within Sri Lanka have been further strengthened. Therefore, she urged the public not to panic or create undue fears regarding this issue.
