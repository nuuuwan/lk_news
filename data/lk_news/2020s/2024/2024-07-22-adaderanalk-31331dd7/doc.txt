Teachers’ and principals’ issues to be addressed within this week – Edu. Minister

Minister of Education Susil Premajayantha assures that the issues raised by teacher-principal trade unions will be addressed within this week.

Several teacher-principal trade unions launched a two-week-long work-to-rule campaign starting today (22) in protest of the government’s inaction in resolving teacher-principal salary discrepancies.

Accordingly, teachers and principals claimed that they will not fulfil any professional commitments beyond their usual academic activities.

Meanwhile, the Convenor of the National Collective Against Teachers’ & Principals’ Salary Disparities Ven. Ulapane Sumangala Thero said that they do not support the union action planned with the aim of strengthening political movements.

However, Minister Premajayantha stated that the trade union action will not hinder academic activities in schools.
