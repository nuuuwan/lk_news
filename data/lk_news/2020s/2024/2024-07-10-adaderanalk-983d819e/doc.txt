President hails non-striking govt. employees, assures special increment

President Ranil Wickremesinghe has expressed his gratitude to all non-executive government employees who reported for duty on July 8 and 9, despite the trade union actions.

Posting on ‘X’ (formerly Twitter), Wickremesinghe stated that their commitment during these challenging economic times “exemplifies true patriotism and integrity”.

Furthermore, the Head of the State highlighted that the special salary increment for these government employees, approved by the Cabinet of Ministers, comes as a mark of the government’s gratitude towards them.

“This increment recognizes your efforts to strengthen the country and support its people when Sri Lanka needs you the most”, he added.
