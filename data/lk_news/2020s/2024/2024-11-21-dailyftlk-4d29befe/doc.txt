Prof. Anil Jayantha Fernando assumes duties as Minister of Labour

Prof. Anil Jayantha Fernando officially assumed his responsibilities as the new Minister of Labour yesterday at the Ministry premises.

Addressing Ministry staff during an introductory meeting, he emphasised his commitment to align his work and decisions with the political vision and electoral manifesto of the Government led by the National People’s Power (NPP).

Minister Prof. Fernando assured staff members that while the Ministry operates under the NPP’s mandate, they are free to hold their own political views and beliefs.

“You are not required to agree with the ideology of the NPP,” he said, “but the focus must remain on working towards the goals outlined in the electoral mandate entrusted to us.”

He highlighted the critical role of the Ministry in addressing labour-related matters and emphasised the interconnected nature of Ministry staff and workers. “Ministry staff and workers are fundamentally the same; both are integral parts of the labour force we serve and represent,” he said.

The Minister also underscored the importance of human resources as a vital area for development. “Human resources are pivotal in achieving our mandate. Unlike other fields, it offers fewer limitations and a broader scope for fostering growth and innovation,” he explained.

Prof. Fernando assured there will be enhanced collaboration and coordination among ministries under the NPP Government, stating that the Government is committed to maintaining harmonious relations across different departments. “Our Government’s connection and coordination with other ministries will be strong. Disagreements, if any, will be addressed through dialogue and resolved amicably,” he said.

He expressed confidence in the efficiency of the Cabinet and its ability to provide the necessary support to ensure the Ministry of Labour achieves its objectives.
