President outlines NPP’s inclusive vision for transformative change

Affirms NPP will only exit power after achieving unified, reformed SL

Calls NPP’s rise response to public demand for change, citing traditional power retention blocks true reform

Sees the 14 Nov. General Election as essential for securing additional reform power

Reveals plan to streamline governance with reduced ministerial privileges, public sector salary increases in the upcoming Budget, including special provisions for estate workers

Says diplomatic posts with political appointees will be reassessed to promote clean governance

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday outlined the National People’s Power (NPP) party’s inclusive vision to bring about transformative changes aligned with public demand.

“We aim to leave power only once we have successfully rebuilt this nation,” Dissanayake pledged, addressing a rally in Nuwara Eliya, reinforcing the NPP’s promise to steer the country towards a more unified and inclusive political landscape.

He underscored the district’s importance in the upcoming General Election, noting the NPP’s vision to unite Sri Lanka’s Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim communities under one political movement.

“Historically, our country’s politics have been divided, with Tamil parties representing Tamils and Sinhala parties for the Sinhalese. For the first time, however, a political movement seeks to unite all communities in the Nuwara Eliya district,” he stressed.

Reflecting on his Presidency, Dissanayake highlighted the NPP’s unique path. “If we were following traditional politics, the Presidency would suffice. But the people’s support for the NPP at the Presidential election was a call for real change. Many old leaders cling to power even after defeat – this blocks true reform. We need influence beyond just the Presidency to drive meaningful transformation,” he added.

Noting that the NPP wields influence through the President and three Cabinet Ministers, he stated that the 14 November Parliamentary election is critical to securing additional authority for reform, with plans to hold Provincial Council elections next year and local Government elections soon.

He indicated that the NPP’s approach to governance would break from past practices, with streamlined Cabinet roles and reduced privileges for ministers.

“Ministers will no longer have official residences in Colombo or extensive security details,” he said.

Dissanayake also announced plans for public sector salary increases in the upcoming Budget, with special provisions for estate workers.

Additionally, the President confirmed plans to recall diplomats with political appointments from overseas missions as part of a broader commitment to clean governance.
