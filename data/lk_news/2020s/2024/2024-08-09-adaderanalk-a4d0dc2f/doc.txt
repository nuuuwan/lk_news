This MOU has been entered into by the FIU, in terms of the provisions of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 6 of 2006, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) announced.

Registrar General W.R.A.N.S. Wijayasinghe and Director of the FIU Dr. Subhani Keerthiratne have signed the MOU on behalf of the respective institutions. The MOU was signed in the presence of Dr. P Nandalal Weerasinghe, the Governor of the CBSL, in the capacity as the Chairman of the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) National Coordinating Committee, and Mrs. E H Mohotty, an Assistant Governor of the CBSL, also attended the event.

Legal persons and legal arrangements could be misused for ML/TF and related crimes, and thereby could threaten the stability of the national and global economic and financial systems, the CBSL said, adding that legal arrangement includes an express trust, a fiduciary account or a nominee.

This MOU will facilitate Registrar General’s Department to provide information to the FIU relating to Trusts, property registrations and any suspicious activities, which will be vital for prevention, detection and prosecution of ML/TF and related crimes.
