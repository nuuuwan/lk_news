Need for passenger-friendly security at airports

The aviation industry universally enforces a rule that prohibits carrying liquids exceeding 100ml in hand luggage. This regulation, implemented for security reasons, aims to prevent the smuggling of liquid explosives. All containers must fit into a single, clear, resealable one-liter bag, making the process cumbersome for travellers who must decant and essential liquids into smaller containers.

Ironically, once past the security checkpoint, passengers can purchase large quantities of liquids, including alcohol and perfumes, from duty-free shops. These items, often exceeding the 100ml limit, are allowed on board as long as they remain sealed in tamper-evident bags. This contradiction highlights a gap in the logic of the regulations. While security measures are crucial, the inconsistency in rules—permitting duty-free purchases but not allowing even a sealed bottle of water—can be frustrating and seems contradictory to passengers.

Coordination between airport and airline security can sometimes be problematic. While airport security handles the initial screening, airline security might impose additional checks at the gate by the ground staff of Sri Lankan airlines. This lack of synchronisation can lead to repetitive screenings, delays, and added stress for passengers. The overlapping responsibilities and differing protocols between these entities can create confusion and inefficiency.

A significant issue with Sri Lankan Airlines’ ground staff is their frequent uncertainty about what items to allow through security. When faced with indecision, their default response often tends to be an inconvenience to the passengers. This cautious yet overly strict approach results in unnecessary confiscations and heightened stress for travellers. For example, harmless items might be removed without proper assessment, leaving passengers frustrated and inconvenienced.

One of the most troubling aspects of SriLankan ground staff’s behaviour is their reluctance to reverse decisions even when proven wrong. Once a decision is made, staff members often remain adamant, displaying a resistance to admitting mistakes or considering new information. This inflexibility can lead to prolonged disputes and a negative experience for passengers, who feel unfairly treated and powerless to rectify the situation.

Compared to advanced airlines, SriLankan Airlines’ ground staff procedures seem outdated. Where leading airlines use sophisticated risk assessment tools and staff training to ensure efficient and fair security screenings, SriLankan staff rely on more rudimentary methods. This gap in procedure and training contributes to the overall negative perception and inefficiency of the security process.

Contrasting sharply with the ground staff, SriLankan Airlines’ cabin crew exhibit extraordinary passenger-friendly attitudes. They are known for their warm hospitality, attentiveness, and commitment to making flights pleasant for passengers. This contrast between ground and cabin staff highlights a significant inconsistency within the airline’s service standards.

The cabin crew’s efforts of SriLankan airline to ensure passenger comfort and satisfaction stand in stark contrast to the often frustrating and adversarial interactions with ground staff. By providing exceptional in-flight service, they help mitigate some of the negative experience passengers face during the initial security processes, creating an overall more positive impression of the airline.

Certain airports and airlines enforce extremely strict security measures requiring passengers to remove belts, shoes, and sometimes even more, leaving them with only their essential clothing. These practices, while aimed at ensuring maximum security, can be invasive and uncomfortable, particularly for vulnerable passengers like the elderly, disabled, or those traveling with young children.

SriLankan Airlines has been criticised for its inconsistent and sometimes irrational security policies and discriminating approach. Passengers report that the airline often removes items referred by airport security as “risky” without proper due diligence or common sense, seemingly to intimidate and discourage decision-making by the airport security staff. This overzealous approach can lead to unnecessary inconvenience and the confiscation of harmless items.

SriLankan Airlines could benefit from adopting more sophisticated risk identification techniques used by other airlines, such as Qantas. These techniques involve using advanced technology and intelligence to assess threats more accurately, thereby minimising unnecessary disruptions to passengers while maintaining security.

Airports in cities such as Melbourne have implemented passenger-friendly security systems and trained their staff to be more accommodating. For instance, they allow transit passengers who have mistakenly passed through the migration process to return to the relevant gates without undergoing customs procedures. The ground officers are senior personnel with the necessary authority to open even exit gates for this purpose. They would reverse such erroneous migration entries with just a mere telephone call to the immigration office. This flexibility, enabled by empowering ground staff with decision-making authority, significantly enhances the passenger experience. Such practices demonstrate that security and efficiency can coexist without compromising passenger comfort.

Despite criticisms of its airline’s security policies, Sri Lanka’s customs and immigration systems and staff have received praise for their friendly yet diligent approach. Similar to advanced countries, Sri Lankan officials are known for balancing thoroughness with a respectful and approachable manner, ensuring a smooth and positive experience for travellers. This balance is crucial in maintaining security while also making passengers feel valued and respected.

Here’s an overview of the various hassles encountered at different checkpoints and some insights into why these processes are necessary and how they could be improved.

Language Barriers: Non-native speakers may find it challenging to understand instructions or fill out necessary forms, adding to their stress levels.

Privacy and Dignity Concerns: The invasive nature of security screenings, including pat-downs and body scans, can make passengers feel uncomfortable and violated.

Time Management: Navigating these checkpoints requires careful time management. Passengers need to arrive at the airport well in advance, often leading to long waiting periods before boarding.

Technological Advancements: Improved screening technology could reduce the need for physical searches and make the process quicker and less invasive. For instance, more advanced X-ray machines and AI-powered scanners can enhance efficiency and accuracy.

Streamlined Processes: Implementing more streamlined and user-friendly processes at check-in and security checkpoints, such as better signage and more efficient queue management systems, could reduce wait times and stress.

Sniff dogs: Introducing sniffer dogs would also be helpful in reducing any risks involved in relaxing certain stringent policies, especially in customs control purposes.

Customer Service: Training security personnel and airline staff in customer service and sensitivity can improve the passenger experience, making them feel more respected and understood during these necessary security procedures.

Navigating airport and airline security is fraught with challenges and inconsistencies, from stringent liquid restrictions to overly aggressive security checks. However, by adopting best practices from leading airports and airlines, improving coordination between security entities, and empowering staff to make sensible decisions, the overall passenger experience can be significantly enhanced. Continuous learning and adaptation in security protocols, coupled with a focus on passenger comfort, are key to achieving a balance between stringent security measures and a hassle-free travel experience.

While airport and airline security checkpoints are essential for ensuring passenger safety, they undeniably cause hassle and stress to the travel experience. SriLankan Airlines’ ground staff, in particular, exacerbate this stress through uncertain decision-making, adverse default responses, and resistance to correction. Improving their training and adopting more sophisticated procedures could significantly enhance the passenger experience. By embracing technological advancements, streamlining processes, and enhancing customer service, especially by learning from the exemplary behaviour of their own cabin crew and leading airlines, the industry can mitigate these challenges, creating a smoother and more pleasant journey for all travelers.
