Sufficient rice, vegetables, eggs, chicken, fruits supplied to market for festive season

Colombo, April 11 (Daily Mirror) - Locally produced rice, vegetables, eggs, chicken and fruits needed for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year celebrations have been supplied to the market without any shortages, Agriculture and Plantation Industries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.

He said the vegetable prices, which increased rapidly about a month ago and the shortage of vegetables have been completely ended by now. Under the government's programme to increase production in the country, more than the required amount of poultry meat, eggs, vegetables, fruits and rice are now available in the market.

"People also claimed that the price of a kilogramme of carrot will go up to Rs. 5,000 during the New Year season. But now, not only the price of carrots but also the prices of all other vegetables have come down. Although some said that the price of an egg will go up to Rs. 75, the price of eggs has also decreased to Rs. 40," he said.

"During previous years, the prices of these goods in the market increased during the Sinhala and Tamil New Year celebrations. But this time there is no such price increase. And you can buy as many consumer goods as you need without a shortage.

"Today, the markets are overflowing with rice, vegetables and fruits. Our farmers deserve full credit for this. According to the measures taken by the government, the prices of essential food items will be reduced further in the future.

"By May, the price of an egg will decrease to between Rs. 30 and Rs. 38. Similarly, we have several other challenges as well," the Minister said, and added, "Our goal is to overcome all these and make the country self-sufficient in food."
