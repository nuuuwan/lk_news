Ongoing railway strike disrupts services, cancels 48 trains

Colombo, June 9 (Daily Mirror) - A total of 35 trains were canceled this morning due to the ongoing strike by the Sri Lanka Railways Locomotive Operating Engineersâ€™ Union.

The strike, which began at midnight on June 6, is now on its third day.

Despite the cancellations, 41 trains were still able to operate this morning.

According to a senior official from the Railways Department, measures were taken to ensure all-night mail trains ran on June 7 and 8, with plans to continue running night mail services today.
