Tense situation in front of SLFP headquarters

A tense situation has been reported in front of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) headquarters at Darley Road in Colombo 10.

The tense situation arose after a group trying to enter the party building were obstructed by police, Ada Derana reporter said.

Meanwhile, Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was appointed as the Acting Chairman of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), sources told Ada Derana.

This appointment has been made by the SLFP faction led by former President Maithripala Sirisena, who has been prevented by a court order from functioning as party chairman, during its executive committee meeting held in Athul Kotte today (21).

On April 04, the Colombo District Court issued an enjoining order preventing former President Maithripala Sirisena from functioning as the SLFP chairman.

Later, the SLFP’s politburo appointed Minister of Ports, Aviation and Shipping Nimal Siripala de Silva as the party’s Acting Chairman on April 08.
