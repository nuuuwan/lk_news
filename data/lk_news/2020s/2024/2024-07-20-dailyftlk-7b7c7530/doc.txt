DIE says prior online registration required to apply for passports

The Department of Immigration and Emigration (DIE) said yesterday that prior online registration is now required when applying for a Sri Lankan passport with the new methodology.

The Department further stated that it is no longer possible to obtain a passport by visiting the department without first being assigned a date and time through the online registration system.

An applicant must reserve a date and time through the http://www.immigration.gov.lk/ website to obtain or renew a passport.

This requirement applies to both the one-day service and the general service.

However, despite this new system being launched yesterday, a large number of people had arrived at the Immigration and Emigration Department office in Battaramulla this morning to obtain passports without making such reservations.

After it was announced that only those with a reserved date and time would be served, the applicants who had not registered online in advance had voiced their objections causing a heated situation, resulting in long queues and congestion in front of the department.

Given the tense situation, the police and the anti-riot units were called in to ensure order.
