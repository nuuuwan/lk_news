Two foreign women arrested at BIA with swallowed cocaine capsules

Two foreign women, who were attempting to smuggle in 500 grams of cocaine by ingesting them have been arrested at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake.

Their drug smuggling attempt was thus foiled by the officers of the Narcotics Control Unit of Sri Lanka Customs attached to the BIA.

According to the customs spokesperson, as many as 40 capsules of cocaine have thus far been extracted from the two women and the market value of the contraband is estimated to be around Rs. 20 million.

The two women, identified as Guinean nationals, had arrived at the Katunayake airport onboard a Turkish Air flight on Saturday morning (20), from the West African country Sierra Leone via the Turkish city of Istanbul.

The duo, aged 40 and 42 years, have been handed over to the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) for onward investigations.
