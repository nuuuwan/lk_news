Sajith demands immediate compensation for enforced COVID-19 cremations

Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa welcomes Cabinet’s decision to issue an apology but says an apology alone is insufficient

Criticises former President Gotabhaya Rajapaksa’s Cabinet Ministers for supporting the policy

Calls for a thorough investigation into the decision-making process and naming of those responsible

Emphasises importance of transparency and accountability to ensure justice for the affected Muslim community

Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa has welcomed the Cabinet’s decision to issue an apology for the mandatory cremation of COVID-19 victims during the pandemic. However, he emphasised that an apology alone is insufficient and proposed that compensation be paid to those affected by the controversial decision.

Speaking in Parliament yesterday Premadasa said, “You cannot get away by tendering an apology. Compensation should be paid to those who were affected.”

Further amplifying the demand for accountability, MPs A.L.M. Athaullah and Mujibur Rahman advocated for penalising those responsible for the cremation policy. Additionally, MP Harsha de Silva urged the introduction of a motion to ensure truth, reconciliation, accountability, and reparation for the affected groups. “The truth behind the wrong decision should be known to determine who is responsible for it and how one should be accountable for it. It will be possible to bring in reconciliation if these steps are taken,” de Silva stated.

Premadasa criticised former President Gotabhaya Rajapaksa’s Cabinet ministers for supporting the policy, which he argued violated the religious and cultural rights of the Muslim community, fostering racism and discrimination in the country. He demanded transparency in the decision-making process, questioning who advised the mandatory cremation policy and why the political authority was not consulted.

“The truth behind the wrong decision should be revealed to determine responsibility and accountability. Naming those responsible and providing compensation to the affected Muslim community is essential,” Premadasa emphasised. He further asserted that seeking forgiveness alone is insufficient to address the grievances caused by the policy.

Premadasa reiterated the importance of transparency and accountability, stating that the mandatory cremation policy was a wrong decision that violated the religious and cultural rights of the Muslim community. He called for a thorough investigation into the decision-making process and the naming of those responsible.
