New legislation to protect women from discrimination based on sexual orientation

Sri Lanka is moving towards protecting women from discrimination based on sexual orientation.

This was confirmed by the Women’s Empowerment Bill which was presented to Parliament. One of the objectives of the legislation which has been already gazetted is to protect women from all forms of discrimination based on gender and sexual orientation.

The legislation further seeks to take steps to prevent discrimination, marginalization, sexual harassment and violence against women.

It also seeks to promote realization of, and ensure equality and justice of women and to take measures to ensure as far as possible women’s participation in all measures and mechanisms connected with administration of justice and equal representation of women in decision making structures and positions at every level within the government.

The legislation provides provision to appoint a women’s empowerment commission which will comprise seven members of which five will be women. The commission members will be appointed by the President following the recommendation of the Constitutional Council and the Women’s Caucus of Parliament. The commission will have the power to inquire and investigate I to infringement of women’s rights and receive complaints.

The commission will have the power to intervene in any proceedings relating to infringements pending before any court with the permission of such a court.
