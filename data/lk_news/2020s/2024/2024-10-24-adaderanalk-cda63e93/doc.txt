Travel advisories for Sri Lanka can be withdrawn within 2-3 days – Minister

Public Security Minister Vijitha Herath says that the travel advisories issued by several foreign countries for Sri Lanka could be lifted within the next two to three days.

Minister Herath stated this during a special press conference held in Colombo today (24), to brief on the steps taken following information received on possible attacks targeting foreign tourists in Sri Lanka.

He reassured to public and the tourists that there is no cause for concern, as necessary security measures have been taken to ensure the security of the foreign tourists.

“They have been informed through the hotels and the Tourism Authority. Police as well as the tri-forces have taken the required steps. So, tourists can travel freely. The countries that have imposed travel advisories will be able to withdraw them in two to three days,” the Minister said.

Furthermore the Minister stated: “We will restore normalcy in a few days, allowing the travel advisories issued by the United States and other countries to be lifted. These nations are already satisfied with the measures we’ve implemented, and they have confidence in sending their citizens to Sri Lanka for tourism.”

“Tourist arrivals have not been affected. Even the day before, Israeli tourists arrived in Sri Lanka without any issues. Those currently here are enjoying their travels freely, without any obstacles. We have already successfully managed the situation”, he added.

He further stated that the public, local as well as foreigners, need not entertain any fears on probable attacks on Israelis or any others, as all possible security measures have been taken to ensure their safety.
