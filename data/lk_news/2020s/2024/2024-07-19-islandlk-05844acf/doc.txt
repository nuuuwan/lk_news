It was an exceptional opportunity to showcase their culinary skills and Sri Lanka’s gastronomic heritage. This engagement reflects the restaurant’s growing local and international reputation for quality and service since opening its doors in 2021. Ceylon Curry Club is proud to have represented Sri Lanka and Citrus Group at such a prestigious occasion, which was graced by celebrities and leaders from all over the world.
