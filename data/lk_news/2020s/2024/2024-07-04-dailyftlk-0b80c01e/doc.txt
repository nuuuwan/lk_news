AKD says Ranil has no chance of getting tenure extension

National People’s Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday said President Ranil Wickremesinghe has no chance of getting a one-year extension of his tenure as the Supreme Court has given a clear ruling in 2019 that the President’s tenure is five years.

Dissanayake told the media in Colombo that the President and his group were trying to create confusion among the people about the Presidential election.

“The Supreme Court has given a clear ruling in 2019 when the then President Maithripala Sirisena sought Supreme Court determination of the President’s tenure. The Supreme Court observed that the President’s tenure is restricted to five years as per the 19th Amendment to the Constitution,” he said.

Dissanayake said the NPP never thinks that the President will get an extension of his term as per the ruling given by the Supreme Court in 2019.

He said the NPP will defeat any conspiracies or tactics of the President and his group to secure power without facing the people.

“We will not only defeat Ranil Wickremesinghe’s conspiracies but we will defeat Ranil Wickremesinghe altogether,” he said.

“Ranil has to face the Presidential election. The NPP will defeat all attempts to prevent the election. We request the people not to give in to the unrests and confusions created by the Government,” he said.
