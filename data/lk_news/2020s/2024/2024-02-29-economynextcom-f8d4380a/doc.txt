Sri Lanka to get Cyber Security Act, Authority: Min

ECONOMYNEXT – A National Cyber Security Act will be introduced this year, followed by the establishment of a Cyber Security Authority, State Minister for Technology Kanaka Herath has said.

“The Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (SLCERT) is anticipated to introduce the National Cyber Security Act within the year, followed swiftly by the establishment of the Cyber Security Authority,” Herath said at a press briefing held at the President’s Media Centre (PMC) on Thursday.

Herath said the digital economy which previously stood at 4.73 percent had grown past the 5 percent mark.

“This expansion has notably bolstered the country’s overall economic resilience. To further enhance this momentum, preparations are underway for the Digital Economy Summit scheduled to take place in Sri Lanka at the end of July.”

The summit aims to attract both local and foreign investors, with collaborative efforts from foreign embassies, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Investment Promotion facilitating this initiative. (Colombo/Feb29/2024)
