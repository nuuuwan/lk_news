SC rules against rejection of DNA nomination papers in Vanni

The Supreme Court has ruled that the rejection of the Democratic National Alliance (DNA) nomination papers for the Vanni District in the upcoming General Election was in violation of election laws. The decision follows a petition filed by DNA leader Pararajasingham Udayarasa on 18 October, challenging the Returning Officer’s decision to reject the party’s nomination papers.

During the hearing, Udayarasa, along with two other petitioners, argued that all necessary documents had been duly submitted, and the rejection was therefore unlawful. The petition named the Commissioner General of the Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL), members of the Election Commission, the Vanni District Returning Officer, and other officials as respondents.

After considering the arguments, the Supreme Court ordered the ECSL to approve the DNA’s nomination papers, ruling that the rejection contravened electoral laws. It ordered the ECSL to act accordingly. The court’s decision will now grant the DNA the right to contest in the Vanni District in the upcoming General Election.
