Sri Lanka cricket coach Chris Silverwood resigns

ECONOMYNEXT – Head coach Chris Silverwood has resigned for personal reasons, Sri Lanka cricket said days after Mahela Jayewardene also left.

“Being an international coach means long periods away from loved ones. After lengthy conversations with my family and with a heavy heart, I feel it is now time for me to return home and spend some quality time together,” Sri Lanka Cricket quoted Silverwood as saying in a statement.

“I would like to thank the players, coaches, backroom staff, and management of the SLC for their support during my time in Sri Lanka. Without your support, none of the success would have been possible

“It has been a real honour for me to be part of Sri Lanka Cricket and I will be taking away many fond memories,” added Silverwood.

Under his tenure, the national team won the T20 Asia Cup in 2022 and also reached the finals of the 50-over Asia Cup in 2023, SLC said. (Colombo/June27/2024)
