Sri Lanka and Switzerland consolidate enduring ties with two high-level visits

Foreign Minister, Vijitha Herath, had a cordial meeting with Assistant State Secretary and Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs Peace and Human Rights Division Head Ambassador Tim Enderlin, during his recent visit to Sri Lanka.

The discussion centred on promoting national unity and reconciliation in the country. The Foreign Minister reiterated the Government’s commitment to building one national identity for all Sri Lankans and requested Swiss support for strengthening initiatives such as dialogue and capacity building for attaining sustainable peace and inclusive development. The Swiss side affirmed its continuous support to further strengthen the relations in key areas of mutual interests.

Prior to this visit, Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC) Assistant Director General Ambassador Christian Frutiger visited Sri Lanka as the Chief Guest at a ceremony to mark the successful conclusion of the 14-year ‘Safe Labor Migration Program’ funded by the SDC. The program played a significant role in enhancing labour migration governance and policy reforms, promoting safe and regular migration practices, skills development and recognition, awareness campaigns, and supporting the sustainable reintegration of migrant workers in Sri Lanka. Ambassador Frutiger met with the senior officials at the Ministry and engaged in a discussion to further support Swiss funded initiatives such as de-mining, humanitarian and development assistance to the country.
