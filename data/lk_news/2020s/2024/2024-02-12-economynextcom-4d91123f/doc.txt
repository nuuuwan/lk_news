Sri Lanka needs to diversify markets to address food insecurity: US ambassador

ECONOMYNEXT – The US supports addressing Sri Lanka’s food security challenges, US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung has told Minister of Commerce, Trade and Food Security Nalin Fernando.

“The ambassador emphasized the importance of enhancing food security in the country. She also stated that to slash the food price increase and to adapt to the inflation, Sri Lanka needs to diversify the market,” a statement by the Ministry said.

The trade ministry focuses mainly on decreasing the cost of production, minimizing post-harvest wastage, and enhancing the quality of production, Fernando said after the meeting on Monday (12) at the trade ministry.

Fernando conceded that the country needs assistance with new technology to improve production, and assistance for SME sector productivity improvement.

In May 2023, the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Program estimated that 17 percent of the country’s population are in moderate acute food insecurity.

“Discussed US support to address Sri Lanka’s food security challenges, including USDA’s school feeding program and USAID SriLanka’s initiative to boost paddy productivity,” Chung said on social media platform X (twitter).

“The United States continues to support training and financing to small businesses and entrepreneurs and expand trade between our countries.” (Colombo/Feb12/2024)
