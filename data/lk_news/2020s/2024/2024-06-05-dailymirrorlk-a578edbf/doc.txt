Sri Lankans fighting in Russia-Ukraine war face lies, hardships

Colombo, June 5 (Daily Mirror) - In the midst of the increased number of calls from ex-Sri Lankan soldiers who joined the Russian military to fight against Ukraine, a Sri Lankan delegation headed by State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya will head to Russia later this month to seek repatriation of them under a plan to be implemented in stages, the Daily Mirror learns.

The delegation comprising former Sri Lankan ambassador to Russia Dr.Saman Weerasinghe, Defence Secretary Kamal Gunaratne, MPs Dayasiri Jayasekara and Gamini Waleboda will meet with the Russian defence authorities in Moscow on June 25, 26 and 27.

A top source told Daily Mirror that the Sri Lankan authorities receive numerous telephone calls from those soldiers in the war front seeking to return to the country. It is learnt that these soldiers have been duped into believing that they will get attractive salaries and other perks.

In a move to resolve the matter without any diplomatic tussle between the two countries, Russia has afforded an official visit to discuss arrangements for the early repatriation of soldiers .

The police have arrested two retired generals for illegally acting as recruiting agents for Russian mercenary firms.

Meanwhile , the absence of a Sri Lankan mission in Ukraine has hampered the process of collecting data regarding Sri Lankans fighting there against Russia.

However, the Sri Lankan Embassy in Turkey which is concurrently accredited to Ukraine wrote to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry last Saturday seeking details about Sri Lankans fighting there .

Earlier it was reported that one Sri Lankan died in Ukraine while fighting against the Russians and due to the lack of information, Sri Lankan authorities are unable to verify the present status of those involved in the war.
