The National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (NCCSL) in a statement congratulated Anura Kumara Dissanayake on his election as the ninth Executive President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

“As he takes office during this pivotal period, we recognise the importance of his role in steering the nation through current economic challenges,” the NCCSL said.

NCCSL President Deepal Nelson, on behalf of the council, extended warmest congratulations to President Dissanayake. He also thanked Dissanayake for taking the time, while being a candidate, to attend the NCCSL ‘Voice of Leaders’ forum to educate his vision to members.

The NCCSL, representing the business community, is prepared to support and collaborate with the President in fostering economic growth, developing local businesses – especially in the MSME sector – and enhancing international trade relations, Nelson said. “The Chamber looks forward to initiatives that will bolster economic stability and prosperity. We anticipate policies that will facilitate a favourable business environment, promoting investment and supporting infrastructural development, ultimately benefitting all citizens of Sri Lanka,” he added.
