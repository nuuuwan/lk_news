AIA Poson safety programme saved six lives this year

AIA Insurance concluded the 29th year of its Poson Safety Programme, celebrating zero fatalities and the rescue of six lives. This comprehensive CSR initiative, one of the longest standing projects in the country continues to be a beacon of safety and community service during the religious Poson festival.

AIA deployed over 500 dedicated lifeguards across 39 reservoirs and lakes in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Mihintale, Dambulla, and surrounding regions. Their vigilance ensured pilgrims could participate in their traditional bathing rituals safely and without incident. Complementing these efforts, AIA implemented a comprehensive safety campaign featuring prominently displayed warning signs, banners, and digital media promotions throughout the Anuradhapura District.

Collaborating closely with Sri Lanka Life Saving, Sri Lanka Police, Sri Lanka Navy, and the Civil Security Division, AIA’s Poson Safety Programme has collectively saved more than 260 lives since its inception. This milestone underscores AIA’s enduring commitment to safeguarding the wellbeing of Sri Lankan communities.
