TISL says rampant misuse of public resources obstructs free and fair poll

Transparency Intern-ational Sri Lanka (TISL) has expressed deep concern over the rampant misuse of public resources reported during the “Presidential Election 2024”.

With 580 complaints received as of 4 September, TISL urged the Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL) to take immediate and decisive action to halt these violations and uphold the integrity of the election process.

TISL has identified alarming instances where Government vehicles, including those of the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) and the Sri Lanka Air Force, have been used for election campaigning. TISL has filed Right to Information (RTI) requests with relevant authorities to seek details and transparency on the use of these public resources.

Furthermore, reports have surfaced of public officers, including those in senior categories who do not have political rights, actively campaigning for political parties both in person and on social media. TISL has lodged complaints with the ECSL and the respective heads of institutions, calling for the reconsideration of deploying such officers for election duties.

TISL Executive Director Nadishani Perera last week highlighted several Government decisions that appear to target specific voter groups to influence election outcomes.

“The recent decisions to write off crop loans for farmers and integrate school development officers into the teaching service are concerning. While we support benefits reaching the people, announcing them during an election period in a way that favors certain candidates is an abuse of entrusted power,” she said. “Citizens need to remain vigilant and not let their votes be manipulated or bought. To the candidates we say, your actions now will demonstrate the type of leader you will be if elected. People are watching.” TISL National Coordinator of the Program for Protecting Public Resources Thushanie Kandilpana, while appreciating the swift, preventive action taken by ECSL in response to many complaints lodged by TISL, emphasised that more robust accountability is needed for incidents that have already occurred.

“We have raised the issue of the continuous misuse of the President’s Media Division (PMD) to promote a specific candidate. We urge the ECSL to intervene immediately to stop this trend,” she said.

“The citizens’ ability to live with dignity, enjoy rights and freedoms, ensure economic stability, and secure their future all depend on a free and fair election,” Perera stressed. “This is the citizens’ opportunity to elect their representatives to take critical decisions for the next five years. They must be allowed to do so without interference.”

TISL calls on all citizens to report any misuse of public resources for election campaigns to www.apesalli.lk or to the hotline 0763223442. The public’s vigilance and timely reporting are crucial in safeguarding the democratic process.

TISL Senior Program Manager Gowriswaran Kirupairajah, urged all citizens and media to bring these issues to light and ensure public awareness, holding all stakeholders accountable for their actions during this crucial election period.
