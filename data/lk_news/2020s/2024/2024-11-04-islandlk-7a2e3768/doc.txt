Colombo Tea Traders’ Association celebrates historic 130th Annual General Meeting

The Colombo Tea Traders’ Association (CTTA), the apex private-sector body representing Sri Lanka’s tea trade, marked its 130th Annual General Meeting at the Shangri La on October 25 , 2024. This milestone event brought together over 500 distinguished members, industry veterans, and stakeholders to celebrate CTTA’s enduring legacy and its pivotal role in championing Ceylon Tea on the global stage.

Founded on August 9, 1894, the CTTA has consistently driven progress in the tea industry, overseeing the world-renowned Colombo Tea Auction, the largest single-origin tea auction globally. Over 130 years, CTTA has upheld its founding commitment to “promoting the common interests of tea sellers and buyers while preserving the Colombo Tea Market’s good name.” Reflecting on CTTA’s legacy, Mr. Sanjaya Herath, Chairman of the CTTA, stated, “This landmark anniversary reminds us of our responsibility to sustain the legacy of Ceylon Tea and innovate for the future. Our tea industry must harness advanced technology, foster public-private partnerships, and support smallholder farmers to ensure resilience and growth.”

In honor of this momentous year, CTTA organized a series of impactful initiatives, underscoring its dedication to both heritage and social responsibility. The association expanded its outreach by deploying two 1990 Suwasariya ambulances to Maskeliya and Nivithigala in February, increasing access to essential medical services in tea-growing communities. Additionally, the “Ray of Hope” charity initiative, launched in April, further emphasized CTTA’s commitment to supporting vulnerable communities within the tea sector. The association also revived the Colombo International Tea Convention in July 2024, welcoming over 800 delegates to celebrate Ceylon Tea’s heritage, sustainability efforts, and global role.
