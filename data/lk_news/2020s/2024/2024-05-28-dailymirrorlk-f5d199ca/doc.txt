AG decides not to defend Nilantha Jayawardane

Colombo, May 28 (Daily Mirror) -  The Attorney General's Department informed the Court of Appeal that the Attorney General will not appear on behalf of Senior DIG Nilantha Jayawardane in a writ petition filed against him for his omission and serious dereliction of duty which led to the Easter Sunday bomb attacks.

The Centre for Society and Religion had filed this writ petition before the Court of Appeal seeking an order to conduct a credible investigation and take appropriate actions against Senior DIG Nilantha Jayawardane for his omission and serious dereliction of duty which led to the Easter Sunday bombing in 2019.

When the matter was called before the Court of Appeal with the two-judge-bench comprising Justices Sobhitha Rajakaruna and Dhammika Ganepola, Counsel appearing on behalf of Nilantha Jayawardena informed court that they expect to present limited objections against this petition. The petition was re-fixed for support on July 25.

The Centre for Society and Religion, its Chairman Fr. Rohan Silva and Surach Nilanga, a victim of the Easter Sunday bomb attack filed this petition naming the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Senior DIG Nilantha Jayawardena and the Attorney General as respondents.

The petitioners are seeking a Writ of Mandamus, directing the IGP and the Attorney General to take steps forthwith to initiate appropriate action to facilitate the carrying out of the findings and recommendations of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry appointed in connection with the Easter Sunday bomb attacks.

Counsel Ermiza Tegal appeared for the petitioners while President’s Counsel Chandaka Jayasundera appeared for Nilantha Jayawardane and Deputy Solicitor General Janaka Bandara appeared for the IGP and the Attorney General.
