Doctors to begin strike against suspension of DAT allowance

Colombo, Jan 23 (Daily Mirror) -Â  The government doctors, including specialists, are set to initiate an indefinite strike starting at 8 am tomorrow in protest of the suspension of the increment to the Disturbance, Availability, and Transport (DAT) allowance.

The Health Ministry, responsible for overseeing these allowances, confirmed the suspension decision.

Previously, the DAT allowance was raised from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000 following the government's approval of the President's proposal.

Despite the earlier announcement of the allowance increase, the Ministry clarified that the elevated amount of Rs. 35,000 would be suspended in accordance with the Treasury's directive.

This unexpected turn of events has fueled dissatisfaction among government doctors, leading them to call for an indefinite strike beginning tomorrow morning.
