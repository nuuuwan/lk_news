Asela Sampath tenders apology to ex-Minister Channan Jayasumana

Colombo, March 5 (Daily Mirror)- Asela Sampath, the National Organizer of the All Ceylon Restaurant Ownersâ€™ Association, today tendered an apology and expressed regret to former Minister and Parliamentarian Dr. Channa Jayasumana against two false statements he had made by on 21 June 2021 against Dr. Channan Jayasumana on social media regarding the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine proposed to be manufactured in Sri Lanka with the approval of the World Health Organization.

The defendant had made a defamatory statement against Dr. Jayasumana alleging that the plaintiff in this case had accepted monetary and other advantages with regard to the proposed programme for which Dr. Jayasumana had sued for Rs. 5,000,000 from Asela Sampath for slandering him.

At the outset of the hearing before the Colombo District Court, Counsel appearing on behalf of Asela, Sampath pleaded that his client was willing to tender an apology in court to Dr. Channa Jayasumana.

Counsel V.K. Chosky who watched the interests of Dr. Channa Jayasumana complied with the proposal to accept the apology on condition that the defendant should withdraw all statements made by him in this case and in another case as well.

In an earlier occasion Colombo Additional Magistrate Kanchana Neranjana de Silva had warned Asela Sampath not to make any irresponsible statements against Dr. Jayasumana and was ordered to be released on two personal sureties of Rs. 500,000 each.

In that case Deputy Solicitor General Deleepa had pointed out that while a nationwide vaccination programme was underway to curb the spread of corona, the process would be hampered due to the baseless statements made by Asela Sampath who has no medical knowledge.
