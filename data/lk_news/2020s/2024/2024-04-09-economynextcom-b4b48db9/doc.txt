Usual protesters take U-turn; Sri Lanka postal employees agree to work on April 12 holiday

ECONOMYNEXT – Employees of Sri Lanka’s Department of Posts, who usually protest on various demand, have agreed to work on April 12 holiday to prevent reputational damage on their service amid a higher number of parcel to be delivered, State Media Minister said.

The island nation has received a record number of foreign parcels this year including gifts for the festive reasons from Sri Lankan expatriates to their relatives.

“So it is the responsibility of the Department of Posts to deliver these parcels on time,” Minister Shantha Bandara told reporters at a media briefing in Colombo on Tuesday.

“We were facing an issue with long holidays during the upcoming festive seasons. All the postal employees have decided to report to work on April 12 despite a holiday to prevent a backlog and reputational damage of their service.”

“If not for their service, the people will receive their parcels only around 16th or 17th.”

The State Minister did not elaborate on the overtime payment for the work postal workers will receive in return of their service on a public holiday. Sri Lanka has declared holiday on April 12 as the island nation celebrates the traditional new year.

Strong postal trade unions comprising over 27,000 employees cripple the postal services by protesting for wage hikes, sale of state properties, and privatization.

The last strike in March 2024 was in response to the non-repair of two elevators that have been out of service in the eight-story building at the Central Mail Exchange in Colombo. (Colombo/April 09/2024)
