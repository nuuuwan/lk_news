Former Health Minister and the current Environment Minister Keheliya Rambukwella was arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) yesterday in connection to the controversial scam involving the import of substandard human immunoglobulin IV vials to Sri Lanka.

Rambukwella was taken into custody following a 10-hour statement provided to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). On Thursday Maligakanda Magistrate Lochani Abeywickrama, issued an order for him to appear before the CID yesterday after he failed to appear before the CID earlier in the week and had submitted written justifications for his absence.

During Thursday’s court hearing, Deputy Solicitor General Lakmini Girihagama disclosed that Rambukwella’s explanations were deemed unacceptable. According to Girihagama, Rambukwella failed to attend a meeting he claimed was a reason for his absence. Additionally, the court learned that another scheduled court proceeding, which Rambukwella mentioned, concluded by 1 p.m. providing him with ample time to appear before the CID as required.

Accordingly the Magistrate also imposed a travel ban on Rambukwella, due to what the court perceived as his clear unwillingness to support the investigation.

Earlier this week, the CID also notified the Maligakanda Magistrate Court that minutes from the files seized from former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, related to the fraudulent acquisition of counterfeit immunoglobulin were missing.

CID investigators noted that the log entries and minutes were present in other files related to Cabinet decisions. However, it was disclosed in court that the minutes were absent from the files concerning Cabinet memoranda dated 30 May, 27 September, 25 October, and 5 December 2022.

The Secretary to the Ministry of Health released these files to the CID, following an order from Maligakanda Magistrate Lochani Abeywickrema, prompted by a request from Deputy Solicitor General Lakmini Girihagama, leading the prosecution on behalf of the Attorney General.
