ECSL Chair appeals to citizens to vote on 14 November

Urges all eligible voters to exercise their constitutional right to vote in upcoming election

Highlights power of each citizen’s vote, emphasising that voting is not only a right but also a duty

Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL) Chairperson R.M.A.L. Ratnayake has urged all eligible voters in Sri Lanka to exercise their constitutional right to vote in the upcoming election on 14 November. Addressing a press conference yesterday, Ratnayake highlighted the power of each citizen’s vote, emphasising that voting is not only a right but also a duty.

“Voting is a right granted to you by the Constitution,” Ratnayake said. “It is your duty to exercise that right. Your vote is your power, so head to the polling stations on 14,” he urged.

Ratnayake also provided updates on the election process, confirming that postal voting and the distribution of ballot papers have been completed. Voters who have not yet received their ballot papers were advised to visit the nearest post office to collect them.

With only days left before the polls, Ratnayake reminded the public and candidates that all campaign activities must end by midnight on 11 November, and a period of silence will follow, during which no further campaigning will be allowed. Additionally, he stressed that the election offices of candidates must be cleared by midnight on 12 November.

For those preparing to cast their vote, Ratnayake explained the voting process in detail. He noted that voters must tick the box next to the symbol of the party or independent group of their choice. Failure to do so will result in a rejected ballot and after selecting the party, voters will need to mark the number of their preferred candidate. He said voters are permitted to select up to three candidates, with the name list of candidates and their numbers having been distributed to households in advance to help with the process.

Ratnayake also clarified that voters must select candidates only from the party they chose earlier. “You cannot select a party and then vote for a candidate representing a different party,” he said. “Such ballots will be rejected.” Similarly, he warned that votes for more than one party or independent group, as well as votes for more than three candidates, will also be invalidated.

With these clear instructions in mind, Ratnayake called on all eligible voters to participate in the election and fulfil their civic duty, ensuring that their vote counts in the democratic process.
