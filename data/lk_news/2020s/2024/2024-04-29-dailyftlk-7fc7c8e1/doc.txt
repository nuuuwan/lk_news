US research ship granted entry to SL waters for replenishment

The Sri Lankan Government has granted entry to a US research ship for replenishment purposes alone.

The Ministry of Defence confirmed that while the ship was denied permission to conduct research activities, it was allowed entry for replenishment purposes.

Earlier reports indicated that the Sri Lankan Government declined a request for a research vessel to access Sri Lankan waters, consistent with its policy against permitting research ships in its maritime territory. The vessel, which included students from a US university, specifically sought permission to enter Sri Lankan waters solely for logistical support, including fuel, water purification, and food.

In December of last year, Sri Lanka suspended the entry of foreign research vessels due to significant security concerns raised by neighbouring India and the United States, particularly following the visits of two Chinese research ships within 14 months.

However, the Government recently permitted a German research vessel to dock at the Colombo Port for replenishment purposes. Last month, the Foreign Ministry issued a clarification regarding the ban on foreign research vessels.

The statement clarified that Sri Lanka will continue to permit offshore research vessels to dock at the nationâ€™s ports for replenishment purposes, notwithstanding the one-year ban on such vessels.

The US vessel arrived in Sri Lanka on 19 April and departed on 22 April after obtaining the necessary replenishment services.
