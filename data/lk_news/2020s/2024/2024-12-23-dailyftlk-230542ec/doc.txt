AHRC urges President to tackle judicial and legal reforms

The Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) has urged President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to prioritise and enact critical legal reforms to strengthen the rule of law in Sri Lanka.

In a written appeal, AHRC Policy and Programs Director Basil Fernando highlighted significant shortcomings in the country’s legal and judicial systems that require immediate attention. The organisation outlined three key areas for reform to ensure justice, transparency, and accountability.

The AHRC called for the daily hearing of serious criminal cases in High Courts to address judicial delays and expedite justice delivery. This, it argued, would significantly improve the efficiency of the judiciary.

Second, the organisation stressed the urgency of introducing comprehensive anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation. Such reforms are essential, the AHRC said, to rebuild public trust in governance and ensure greater accountability across all levels of Government.

Lastly, the AHRC urged reforms to the Attorney General’s Department to enhance its independence, efficiency, and transparency in prosecutorial decisions.

The organisation’s recommendations have highlighted the urgent need for systemic changes to uphold the rule of law and strengthen accountability mechanisms in Sri Lanka.
