President addresses APRC, underscores agriculture’s crucial role in nation building

During the 37th session of the Asia and Pacific Regional Conference (APRC) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) on Tuesday (Feb.20), President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced Sri Lanka’s chairmanship until 2026.

The Sri Lankan leader affirmed the government’s dedication to elevating the island nation as a prominent exporter of agricultural produce through rapid agricultural sector transformation.

He emphasized the pivotal role agriculture played in navigating Sri Lanka through the previous economic crisis and highlighted agriculture and tourism as key sectors for the nation’s swift recovery.

These remarks were made during the opening session of the 37th Asia and Pacific Conference of FAO in Colombo, attended by Dr. Qu Dongyu, Director General of the UN FAO.

The conference, which commenced on Monday (Feb.19) in Colombo with the participation of diplomats and representatives from 34 countries including the United States, China, and Russia, will conclude tomorrow (Feb.21). Sri Lanka’s presidency of the Asia-Pacific region of the FAO, succeeding Bangladesh’s hosting in 2022, will extend from now until 2026.

Sri Lanka, having previously hosted the 2nd conference in 1955, is now hosting it again after a span of 69 years. Approximately 70% of the Asia-Pacific region’s population relies on agriculture. This year’s conference, themed “Transformation of the Agro-Food System,” will delve into key areas such as promoting nutritious food production, ensuring food security, enhancing food production, safeguarding the environment, curbing greenhouse gas emissions, and mitigating climate change risks.

Following the conference’s opening session, President Ranil Wickremesinghe participated in a group photo with foreign ministers and delegates before engaging in discussions with attending agriculture ministers.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized the vital role of the Food and Agriculture Organization in bolstering food security, fostering sustainable agricultural production, and advancing resilient small-scale agricultural systems aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals in the Asia-Pacific region.

Highlighting agriculture’s pivotal role in Sri Lanka’s economic transformation, President Ranil Wickremesinghe outlined the country’s forthcoming initiatives.
