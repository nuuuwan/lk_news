Brandix partners GLO programme for unique learning and development experience

Brandix rounded out its commitment for the Guiding Leadership and Outreach (GLO) programme this year, empowering up to 50 individuals across its value chain. GLO is conducted in partnership with the Association for HR Professionals in Sri Lanka and AIESEC, involving Brandix, Fortude, SyscoLabs, John Keells Holdings and IFS.

Under Phase 1 of the GLO programme, five employees from each company benefitted from a unique Train-the-Trainers programme, with sessions hosted by Global Learning Lab. With Phase 2, the GLO programme saw each company engaging students from universities across Sri Lanka to design and deliver a two-day GLO leadership academy. Brandix engaged 22 students who were tasked with developing Sustainable Impact Projects, with one chosen to be funded and implemented.

Accordingly, a Professional Skill Upliftment Workshop in Batticaloa was conducted at the American iHub Batticaloa as the chosen project, with 18 students from the region to enhance knowledge on job application and preparation, selection processes, CV development, behavioral skills and more. The programme was facilitated voluntarily by students who graduated the GLO programme conducted by Brandix.

“The GLO programme offered innovative insights and learning experiences to our employees, alongside the opportunity to engage with the wider community. This is a unique programme that encompasses a cross-section of stakeholders, and Brandix is pleased to both gain and impart value alongside our partners,” averred Sahad Mukthar, Chief People Officer at Brandix.
