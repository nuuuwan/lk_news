Notes party, despite recent setbacks, is analysing all shortcomings in order to improve going forward

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara has emphasised that the SJB is prepared to fulfil its responsibilities as a strong Opposition in a country facing significant economic challenges.

Addressing a press conference in Colombo yesterday, Madduma Bandara noted that while the SJB has now emerged as the main party of the Opposition, it comes with the opportunity and responsibility to carry out a significant task for the country.

“We are closely monitoring the Government’s actions to ensure they honour the promises made to the people and work to strengthen the country’s economy,” he said.

He further noted the SJB’s support for combatting corruption, a key promise of the current Government, led by the National People’s Power (NPP). He recalled that the SJB has actively contributed to legislative efforts in this regard.

“We introduced the Anti-Corruption Bill in Parliament, along with a bill aimed at recovering property and wealth stolen from the country. We call on the Government to enact these laws and implement them immediately,” he said.

Madduma Bandara also raised concerns about the concentration of power within the Government, underscoring the importance of protecting democracy and citizens’ rights. He assured that the SJB is prepared to play a proactive role in safeguarding these principles while holding the Government accountable.

Meanwhile, SJB Chairperson Imtiaz Bakir Marker, also addressing the media, acknowledged the public’s desire for change in the political landscape.

“People did not focus on our policies but chose to bring the NPP to power to challenge the existing political culture,” he said.

Bakir Marker reiterated the SJB’s commitment to reform and innovation in its approach as an opposition party.

“The SJB is not ready to act as a traditional Opposition. We are a movement that challenges conventional politics. Despite setbacks in the Presidential and General Elections, we are analysing these shortcomings and working towards a better future,” he said.

He emphasised the importance of steering the country towards economic recovery by learning from global success stories. “We are observing whether the Government is following the right path to address the economic crisis. When the Government takes positive steps, we will support them. Our ultimate goal is to ensure the country is on the right track,” he claimed.

Both leaders also pledged that the SJB would continue to act as a constructive Opposition, committed to national progress and the welfare of the people.
