University system heading for a standstill

Colombo, May 6 (Daily Mirror) - The university system's administration is on the brink of a standstill due to trade union actions initiated by the Joint Committee of University Trade Unions and the University Executive Officers' Association (UEOA), UEOA President M. W. Vanninayake said.

He told the media that they have launched their trade union action on May 3.

In parallel with this ongoing strike, the UEOA has decided to hold a protest in front of the University Grants Commission (UGC) in Colombo on Wednesday (8) from 10.00 am over eleven main demands including non-rectification of salary anomalies and non-receipt of allowances and other facilities promised by the government are the reasons for this strike, Vanninayake said.

He also said that since January this year, despite various professional actions including symbolic strikes to obtain demands, the authorities did not fulfil their promises, he had to go on a continuous strike.

Meanwhile, Joint Committee of University Trade Unions co-chairman Dhammika S. Priyantha said all non-academic staff members of the university began their trade union action at 12 noon on May 2. This action is driven by various demands, one of which is rectifying a 15% salary cut imposed on non-academic employees.

Since last Thursday, around thirteen thousand non-academic staff members have stopped working. The union says they're gradually pulling out of vital services like supporting students' academic activities, research and lab work, and even tasks like garden maintenance, Priyantha said.

He also said the University Trade Union adjacent committee mentions that its staff will also boycott all maintenance activities such as water, electricity and cleaning services.
