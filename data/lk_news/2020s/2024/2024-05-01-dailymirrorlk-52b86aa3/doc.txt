Around 1,500 workers assigned to clean Colombo after May Day rallies

Colombo, May 1 (Daily Mirror) - A total of 1,500 workers have been assigned for cleaning and garbage collection purposes in Colombo city after the May Day rallies, Colombo Municipal Council Solid Waste Management Division Director Engineering Eng. Shahina M. Mysan said.

She told the Daily Mirror that 1,000 workers were assigned for cleaning purposes in the city, and another 500 workers were assigned for the collection of garbage after the May Day rally.

She also said the workers have been tasked with cleaning the entire city by tomorrow.

On ordinary days, 500 workers are assigned for day shifts, and another 500 are assigned for night shifts. As a requirement of the service, the CMC has decided to assign all janitorial staffers today to clean the town.

Ms. Mysan requested the party leaders advise their members to clean the areas where they hold their May Day rallies. That will help to save the taxes collected from the people living within the CMC limits, she said.

People are also requested to adhere to their cleaning practices, she said.
