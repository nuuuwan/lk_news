Sri Lanka Shippers’ Council congratulates new President AKD and Secretary

The Sri Lanka Shippers’ Council (SLSC) said yesterday it extends its warmest congratulations to the newly appointed President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and the Secretary to the President, Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake.

“Their appointment reflects the Sri Lankan people’s desire for change, not only in leadership but in the direction of the nation’s future,” SLSC said in a statement.

The SLSC said it is optimistic about the new leadership, particularly the President’s commitment to creating an inclusive society, promoting transparency, reducing corruption, and driving sustainable economic development. The council hopes the new administration will address pressing concerns in the trade sector, including the full digitalisation of customs, streamlining import/export procedures, and eliminating corruption from the industry.

The SLSC said it firmly believes these reforms will strengthen the Sri Lankan economy, creating a fair and competitive environment where trade can flourish. The Council is eager to collaborate with the Government to bring these changes to life, offering its full support to ensure the success of these initiatives.

“As Sri Lanka embarks on this new chapter, the SLSC looks forward to working hand in hand with the Government to safeguard the interests of the shipping industry and foster growth in the country’s trade sector,” the statement added.
