SL facing the challenge of attracting ESG conscious foreign and local investors

Sri Lanka appears to be facing the challenge of attracting local and foreign investors towards Sustainable Bonds; the likes of Green Bonds and Blue Bonds, and other sustainable debt instruments that have a common goal to create a sustainable ecosystem, and are becoming an important part of global fixed income markets.

This was made known during the course of a speech made by the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Faizal Salieh, at a seminar centred on ‘Unlocking Opportunities through Sustainable Bonds: Towards a Greener Economy’.

The event had been organized by the SEC, The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) at Shangri-La Colombo on July 3.

“The challenge is how quickly can Sri Lanka socialize these bonds and attract ESG conscious foreign investors, whilst being mindful of Sri Lanka’s default sovereign rating hurdle. We also need to build an ESG conscious local investor base,” he said.

“We are witnessing a new landscape of ESG conscious investor activism evolving in the world today, inspiring and moving markets towards a greener horizon. Investors are becoming more and more conscious and concerned about impact reporting, climate change mitigation, social equity considerations, transition towards a circular economy, and are driving the demand for innovative green financing and green financial instruments. A green and sustainable economic environment is now the joint responsibility of the government, business and civil society,” he pointed out.

Speaking further the SEC chairman said,” Sustainable Bonds, the likes of Green Bonds and Blue Bonds, and other sustainable debt instruments have a common purpose and goal to create a sustainable ecosystem and are becoming an important part of global fixed income markets. According to a report by the Climate Bonds Initiative, green bonds issued reached a record high of USD 1.1 trillion in 2023, driven by strong demand from investors seeking to finance climate-friendly projects. In the global stock take, nature and biodiversity are key factors for mitigating risks and protecting vulnerable communities in a heating planet. Nature-based financial solutions are crucial in this regard and the compelling reason for markets to embrace and enable sustainable debt instruments.”

“COP 28 has identified the continuing prevalence of a large climate finance gap, an even larger overall environmental finance gap, and a huge UN SDG finance gap. To close these gaps, countries need to mobilize much more private capital at a much faster pace through the capital markets, and allocate it to projects, products, and processes that have a positive impact on the sustainability agenda.”

“Investors are actively seeking to align their investments with ESG principles and contribute to the transition to a climate-friendly low-carbon economy. Green finance instruments are increasingly being integrated into mainstream investment portfolios.”

“Sustainable Bonds fit this purpose. They are structured to finance new and existing projects and activities with positive environmental impact. Sustainable Bonds can raise funds for projects in renewable energy, energy efficiency, clean transportation, green buildings, wastewater management and climate change adaptation in accordance with the globally defined and accepted principles, rules and requirements that govern the issuance of Sustainable Bonds.”

I am happy to say that the SEC, with the technical support and assistance of the ADB, has established an enabling policy and regulatory framework for Sustainable Bonds since Oct 2023. Any prospective issuer; whether the government, parastatal agencies or the private sector can now raise capital under this framework. We also have had ADB’s technical assistance for other new initiatives such as the Collective Investment Schemes (CIS) Code and the regulatory framework for Islamic Capital Market Products.”

“The regulatory framework for Sustainable Bonds provides discerning investors higher comfort levels by mandating an independent and professional verification and assurance process on the use of the capital raised, performance monitoring and periodic reporting requirements. Investor engagement is a key part of labeling a bond. The increased transparency of sustainable bonds helps build investor trust and confidence.”

“Sustainable Bonds provide more market power, relevance and value benefits to issuers. Though the connected costs and resources may seem to be bit cumbersome at the outset, the effort required for the next round of issues would be substantially less than that for the first round and so on. The extra effort on the issuer for labeling continues to decline in the long run.”

“By expanding the availability of green finance instruments and fostering collaboration between investors, issuers, and regulators, financial markets will be able to accelerate the transition to a more sustainable and resilient financial system.”

“Though the regulatory framework has been in place since Oct 2023, we are yet to see new issues in the local capital market. So it is critically important that all stakeholders come together, work together and support one another to kick start sustainable bond issuances,” he said.
