Sri Lanka Cabinet decides to order passports from old vendor

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet of minsters have decided to order passports from its previous supplier following a court order, and call tenders after a 750,000 books in the order run out, Minister Vijitha Herath said.

“We expect the first stock to come by next Monday,” minister Herath told a post-cabinet press briefing.

The earlier supplier agreed in court to supply passports at a specific cost, Herath said.

“Considering the urgent need in the country, at a special cabinet meeting [held on Oct 11], we decided to approve the company providing 750,000 passports in batches.

“We believe this will address the shortage soon. By Saturday we will get one batch and by Monday the new passports will be issued.

“But these 750,000 will last about four to five months and the need for more passports will arise. So the cabinet decided that we will call for tenders and order more.”

Tenders won’t be called for e-passport suppliers at this time due to a court order, Herath said.
