Health workers to resort to another strike

Colombo, Jan 31 (Daily Mirror) -Â In a decisive move set to reverberate across the nation's healthcare landscape, at least 72 trade unions within the health sector have announced plans for an island-wide strike commencing at 6:30 a.m. tomorrow (01).

The primary demand fueling this action is the long-standing dispute over the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance.

Despite assurances from the highest levels of government, including promises of dialogue upon the President's return from official overseas duties, healthcare workers remain disillusioned by the lack of substantive engagement.

The trade unions assert that no formal discussions have materialized since the President's return, exacerbating the brewing discontent among healthcare professionals.

However, the All Ceylon Nurses' Union, a prominent voice in the healthcare arena, has opted not to takepart in the scheduled strike.
