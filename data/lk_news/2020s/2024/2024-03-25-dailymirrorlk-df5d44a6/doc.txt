COPF showdown led to milk powder price slash: Harsha

Colombo, March 25 (Daily Mirror) - The Committee on Public Finance's (COPF) showdown with milk powder importers led to the slashing of milk powder prices, its chairman Harsha De Silva said today.

"After the showdown at COPF where we refused to increase tax on milk powder and found fault with the regulator for lack of competition in the absence of the formula, the story has taken a completely different turn. Instead of an increase, now prices have fallen by Rs. 150 a kilogram," de de Silva said in his X message.
