Sri Lanka delays Hilton building sale until after the elections

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has halted the sale of Hotel Developers (Lanka) Ltd, a state-run. company that owns the building housing Colombo Hilton, until elections are completed, the Finance Ministry said.

The Finance Ministry statement said several social and mainstream media reports relating to the sale of Hilton hotel are not correct.

A claim that the Government Chief Valuer has released a valuation in July 2024, which was lower than a 124 million dollars assessed in August 2024 was false, the statement said.

“Furthermore, it should be noted that the divestiture of Hotel Developers (Lanka) Ltd will not be finalized until the Presidential election is completed,” the statement said.

Several investors expressed initial interest in the building but only one party made a final bid.

Analysts familiar with asset sales say valuation usually come in a range and they are sometimes not made public as bidders will then submit valuations at the or close to the floor price.
