Sri Lanka calls applications for National Police Commission vacancy

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has called for applications to fill a vacancy in the National Police Commission.

The commission consists of 7 members of which two members are yet to be appointed, according to its webpage.

The parliament issued a statement calling for applications this week.

Applications should be sent to ‘Secretary-General to the Constitutional Council, Constitutional Council – Office, Parliament of Sri Lanka, Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte’ on or before July 1 by registered post, or by email to constitutionalcouncil@parliament.lk.

‘Appointment of Members to the NPC’ should be on the top left-hand corner of the envelope, or as the subject of the email.

Members of Parliament, Provincial Councils or any local authority are not eligible to apply for the member post.

“Further, every person who immediately before his/ her appointment as a member of the Commission, was a public officer in the service of the State or a judicial officer, shall upon such appointment taking effect, cease to hold such office and shall be ineligible for further appointment as a public officer or a judicial officer.”

The applications should be prepared in accordance with the information sheet which is available in the parliament website www.parliament.lk with a quick link named ‘Appointment of the members to NPC’,

The NPC was established under the 21st Amendment to the Constitution, and was intended to eliminate political interference and make the department more efficient, but successive commissions have revealed their partisanship, which has effectively blocked any decisive action.
