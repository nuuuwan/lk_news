Sri Lanka named best destination for solo female travellers

A London-based global magazine has named Sri Lanka as the best destination for solo female travellers.

According to Time Out, the Indian Ocean island is the ‘perfect first stop’ for female travellers wanting to dip into South Asia.

The magazine further says that Sri Lanka is popular with backpackers and perfectly sized for a week or a month spent exploring the ancient UNESCO-listed sites like Dambulla and Sigiriya or visiting tea plantations in Nuwara Eliya.

“And for some blissful downtime, the golden beaches of Arugam Bay, Mirissa and Hikkaduwa promise beachfront hostels, surfing and delicious local food.”

Portugal has been ranked the second-best destination, followed by Czechia, Japan, Guatemala, Vietnam, Australia, Greece, and New Zealand, respectively.

The magazine says more women than ever are now heading to far-flung destinations in search of new friends, different cultures, and memorable experiences.
