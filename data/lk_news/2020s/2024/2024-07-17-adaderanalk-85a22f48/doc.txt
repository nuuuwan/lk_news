Committee to conduct threat assessments on presidential candidates, ex-Presidents

In view of the forthcoming Presidential Election, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has submitted a Cabinet paper for the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers to ensure the safety of the candidates.

This proposal suggests the appointment of a committee to conduct threat assessments and provide necessary security for Presidential Candidates as well as former Presidents, the Presidentâ€™s Media Division (PMD) said.

The committee will include the Secretary of the Ministry of Public Security as Chair, the Chief of Defence Staff, the Inspector General of Police, the Chief of National Intelligence, and the Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police/Elections.

Additionally, a Deputy Inspector General of Police will be appointed to oversee all security arrangements, the statement said.

This proposal comes in light of the recent attack on former U.S. President Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, highlighting the pressing need for enhanced security measures.

The committee and the designated officer will work closely with the Election Commission to ensure seamless coordination of security arrangements, the PMD report added.
