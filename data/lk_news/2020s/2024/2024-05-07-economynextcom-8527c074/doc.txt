Singapore ICA to assess Sri Lanka’s airport, immigration for modernization: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – A five-member Singapore’s Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) team will be in Sri Lanka from May 27 to assess the island nation’s immigration counters with an aim to modernize in par with Singapore, Ministry of Public Security Tiran Alles said.

The move comes amid repeated complaints on overcrowded immigration desks at the main Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA).

The ICA is responsible for securing Singapore’s borders against the entry of undesirable people and cargo through land, air and sea checkpoints.

It also administers immigration and registration services, such as issuing passports and Identity Cards to Singapore citizens, and immigration passes and permits to foreigners.

The ICA enforces laws and regulations relating to immigration and registration and is under the Singapore Ministry of Home Affairs.

“I have asked Singapore government to study our airport and immigration to modernise them to the standards of Singapore and to give us a report on that,” Alles told reporters at a media briefing on Monday (06).

“They are from Singapore Immigration Checkpoint Authority. I personally spoke to the minister in charge. This was about six months back. Last week also when I was there, I had a meeting with him and they will do a complete study and give us a report.”

A five member ICA team will study the existing Sri Lankan system.

“Then they will give us a comprehensive report. We may not be able to do this at once. But we have to target to bring the standard to that level,” the Minister said.

“In fact he offered after this, because he is in charge of Home Affairs, the entire home affairs like police all that, new technology what we could use, he offered to send another team to help us by studying other areas.” (Colombo/May 7/2024)
