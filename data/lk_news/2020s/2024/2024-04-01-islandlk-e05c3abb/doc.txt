A worthy cause

This scene, ‘Waggoners Musical Extravaganza 2024’, is for a worthy cause as the proceeds from the event will support social welfare projects of the Army Seva Vanitha Unit.

Organised by the Army Service Corps Seva Vanitha Branch, ‘Waggoners Musical Extravaganza 2024’ will feature the group Infinity along with Sanuka, Falan, Vindi, JAYASRI, and Centigradz.

This concert will be held on 5th April at the Lotus Tower Outdoor Arena, from 8 pm onwards.

The show will also feature dance performances by the One Step Dance troupe

The lineup of artistes look interesting and since it’s for a worthy cause, it would be nice to see music lovers checking out this scene.
