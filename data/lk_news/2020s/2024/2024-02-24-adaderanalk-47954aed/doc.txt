Kurunegala hospitalâ€™s dialysis unit closed after patient deaths; experts committee begins probe

The dialysis unit of the Teaching Hospital in Kurunegala has been temporarily closed on Friday (Feb.23) after a series of patient deaths attributed to a suspected infection.

According to reports, the deaths have taken place since January.

A spokesperson from the hospital said an investigation was previously conducted at the institutional level to determine if the fatalities were a result of an infection caused by the germs that entered the bloodstream or the chemicals administered during the dialysis procedure. However, the exact cause of the deaths remains unknown.

Accordingly, the Ministry of Health has appointed a 5-member committee of experts to look into the matter at the ministerial level, Health Secretary Dr. Palitha Maheepala said.

The panel led by Dr. Samitha Ginige, the head of the Epidemiology Unit has arrived at the hospital for the investigation.

The experts committee is tasked with conducting a comprehensive probe into the deaths and submitting a report containing the recommended measures that need to be taken in this regard.

In light of the situation, the Kurunegala Hospital authorities have decided to direct the kidney patients to the nearest units until its dialysis unit is reopened.
