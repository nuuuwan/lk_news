Sri Lanka should follow India in granting Overseas Citizenship Status

Colombo, Jan 31 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka should take a leaf from India's book and grant Overseas Citizenship Status to people of Sri Lankan origin holding foreign citizenship abroad, opposition MP Mano Ganeshan said.

In a message on his X account he said that Indian law does not allow dual citizenship but provides Overseas Citizenship of India status to persons of Indian origins who migrate from India and acquire foreign citizenship.

“OCI holders can buy residential and commercial properties in India except farmland and they cannot engage in politics but are granted visa free entry, stay and many perks. Let us stop quarreling over dual-citizenship and take the cue  from India. If nearly three million overseas Sri Lankans of all ethnicity, that is, Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims and their spouses  and children are recognized as overseas citizens of Sri Lanka, it would provide a well-defined role to OCSL in rebuilding Sri Lanka. Hassle-free travel with a sense of inclusiveness will intensify heritage and habitual visits,” he said.
