Reminds Govt. it has a responsibility to monitor and regulate activities of foreigners in SL

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Colombo district candidate S.M. Marikkar yesterday called on the Government to monitor and regulate the activity of foreigners in Sri Lanka in the light of recent revelations following a terrorism threat against Israeli tourists in the country.

Addressing a press conference at the Samagi Jana Sandhanaya (SJS) head office, Marikkar highlighted recent warnings from the United States Embassy, which issued a travel advisory to its citizens against visiting the Arugambay tourist zone due to security concerns. He said the Government, in response, acknowledged the advisory and claimed it had taken appropriate measures.

Marikkar, however, questioned the Government’s vigilance, pointing out the influx of foreign nationals, including Israelis, engaged in various activities across Sri Lanka. “The Government has a responsibility to monitor and regulate activities of foreigners in our country,” he stated, noting that similar negligence by previous administrations had failed the people and that this administration risked following the same path.

The former MP also addressed unfulfilled promises by the National People’s Power (NPP), questioning the lack of visible progress since the election. “The people are watching with great interest, waiting for clear dates and timelines for promised reforms,” he remarked.

Marikkar compared the current Government’s performance with the 2015 Good Governance Government, which quickly enacted measures like raising public sector wages and providing a monthly allowance for expectant mothers. “If they had a plan, the NPP should have been able to deliver similar results swiftly,” he asserted.

Marikkar also criticised the Government’s failure to control rising costs, reduce taxes on essential goods, and honour commitments to lower the national debt. “They pledged to eliminate queues for basic necessities and avoid reliance on external debt, yet today we see lines for rice, coconut, and passports. Moreover, they’ve borrowed Rs. 600 billion despite promising otherwise.” The former MP urged the Government to announce a concrete timeline for amending the IMF agreement, which included commitments to tax reductions, noting that both voters and non-voters of the NPP are keenly awaiting signs of the promised changes.
