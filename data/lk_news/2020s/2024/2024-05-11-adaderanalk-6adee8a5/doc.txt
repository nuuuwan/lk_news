Heavy showers over 100mm expected in parts of the island

The Department of Meteorology says showers or thundershowers will occur at several places in most provinces of the island after 2.00 p.m.

Heavy showers more than 100mm are likely at some places in Western, Sabaragamuwa and North-western provinces and in Galle and Matara districts.

Showers may occur at several places in the coastal areas of Southern province during the morning too, it said.

General public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
