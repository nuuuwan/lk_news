Hasaranga's return to Test Cricket saves T20 World Cup participation

Mar. 19 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka all-rounder Wanindu Hasaranga has been suspended for Bangladesh's two-Test series against Bangladesh, shortly after announcing his decision to return to Test cricket following his retirement from the format last year.

During the third ODI in the recently-concluded series against Bangladesh, Hasaranga was found guilty of breaching Article 2.8 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to "showing dissent at an Umpireâ€™s decision during an International Match.

The incident occurred in the 37th over of the game when Hasaranga snatched his cap from one of the umpires and ridiculed the umpiring during the match.

Bangladesh clinched the series 2-1 after winning the contest by four wickets.

Hasaranga received a 50 percent fine and accumulated three demerit points for his offense. This brought his total demerit points to eight within a 24-month period.

The all-rounder was already on five demerit points after receiving three demerit points in the third T20I against Afghanistan in Dambulla last month. Consequently, he was suspended for two T20Is against Bangladesh.

The four suspension points equate to a ban from two Tests or four ODIs or T20Is, whichever comes first. Hasaranga will, therefore, miss the two ICC World Test Championship Tests against Bangladesh.

Sri Lanka won the T20 series against Bangladesh, which was their last T20 series before heading to the T20I World Cup.

Hasaranga, who is the captain of the Sri Lanka T20 side, could have missed the first matches in the T20 World Cup if he had not returned to Test cricket.
