EC issues statement on release of election results

The Election Commission of Sri Lanka announced that with the voting process completed in the 2024 General Election today (14), vote counting will commence after 7:15 p.m. at the main counting centers after ballot boxes reach the respective counting centers.

In a special media statement, Election Commission Chairman R.M.A.L. Ratnayake stated that as soon as the results are received from the returning officers, they will be re-checked and promptly released to the media.

Results will be published in three phases: first at the constituency level, then at the district level, along with the announcement of the number of MPs each political party and independent group will receive.

Preference counting will commence immediately at each counting center as results are released.

However, only the preference votes of political parties and independent groups eligible to secure MP seats will be counted, according to the Election Commission. Representatives of all political parties and independent groups not eligible for MP seats will be required to vacate the premises of the counting centers.
