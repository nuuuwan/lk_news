Digambaram denies allegations of opposing wage hike for plantation workers

Nuwara Eliya District Parliamentarian of Workers’ National Front Palani Digambaram denied accusations that he opposed raising the minimum daily wages of plantation workers.

Speaking at a public meeting in Hatton, Digambaram accused President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Minister Manusha Nanayakkara of misleading estate workers and spreading false propaganda.

The MP’s remarks were in response to a statement made by former Minister Manusha Nanayakkara during a meeting with Kandy District Plantation Labour Unions and Youth Leaders, organized by the Ceylon Workers’ Congress on Saturday (Aug 10).

Nanayakkara had alleged that Digambaram had acted against the interests of estate workers by opposing wage increases.
