A family affair, indeed…

Hi! I’m Shivona Alexander, 35 years of age. I’m a wife, mom to two beautiful daughters, model, and founder of Party Bee.

Believe me, I never thought I would be a model at this age, especially after having two kids. But…I met Brian Kerkoven, in the year 2021, through one of my friends. I took a three-month course at his modelling academy and was lucky enough to join his agency as a professional model. This is my third year as a model, representing BK Model Management, and I’m proud and happy to say that I’m now a part of the BK family.

I would say maintaining a perfect physique, although being a mom of two kids, as well as my age!

Being a model you cannot pick and choose what you should wear. You have to model what the designer gives you. However, sometimes if you are feeling uncomfortable wearing a particular outfit, you can mention that to the designer concerned. As for me, as a model, I always keep in mind that I’m a mother and a wife and, therefore, I prefer wearing outfits in keeping with my status…as a wife and mother.

05. What do you think is the most important aspect of modelling?

I would say confidence and self-respect. If you don’t believe in yourself and your potential then how can you expect others to believe in you! You may not get every part you audition for, but you should always believe in yourself no matter what.

06. If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?

I consider myself as a blessed child, so I would not change anything. I’m happy the way I am.

I studied at Holy Cross College, Gampaha. During my school career, I did a lot of sports and extracurricular activities. I represented Sri Lanka in badminton, on several occasions, at the Asian Junior Badminton Championships, and was a member of the Sri Lanka National Badminton team. I was an athlete (800m, 1500m, 3000m and High Jump). I was also a member of the College choir, drama team, the media unit, and the College Deputy Head Prefect in the year 2006-2007.

I have so many joyful moments in my life which I cherish. But, being a mother in the year 2013, for the first time, was the happiest moment in my life.

My family. Yes, seeing my kids growing up to be beautiful, good citizens in the country, and each and every single quality time that I’m spending with my husband, Terence.

I’m already married to my ideal guy. None of us are perfect in our life, but my husband is a great father to my daughters, and a loving, caring and, mostly, a supportive husband to me. Without his support, I would not have achieved so much success, especially in my career, as a model.

I have two and they are my parents. For the sacrifices that they have made for me and my sister, and to see them loving, caring for each other, for the blessed 41 years of their married life, I think they set a great example to all the young couples today, especially to both of us, and we value and appreciate so much the guidance that we have received from them to make our lives of what we are today.

Most definitely my family – my husband and my two daughters.

13. If you were marooned on a desert island, who would you like as your companion?

My husband would be my greatest companion till the end of my life. I’m experiencing his love, care, the support he has given me for the past 12 years and I’m 100% sure no one could be a better companion other than my husband and I know if he’s around me I can overcome any situation, no matter how hard the situation is.

The day a person, whom I most respected, condemned modelling saying that it is not suitable for convent-educated girls which I vehemently refused to accept and totally rejected. I do not want to discuss this topic any further as her thoughts were disgusting. But may I finally say that the education and the guidance I received during my school career have enabled me to build up a strong character in society, wherever I go and whatever I do. Finally, I need to say that any profession that you choose would be noble only if your thoughts, deeds and actions are true to your conscience.

Kayak 50 km through the Mahaweli River and camping in the jungle for two nights.

Wow, I would say the beach! I would love to sit with a glass of wine, with some good food and music.

I love listening music but the type of music would depend on my mood.

Legends. The songs they play sometimes take me back to my childhood (my school time, the music that I used to enjoy with my friends, etc.)

To be honest, I don’t watch programmes on TV stations. I think we all are used to getting the news and other important stuff through social media now. But, I would say, I’m a Netflix person.

No major plans as such. While supporting my husband’s business activities, I also intend launching my own business “Party Bee” and doing everything possible to make my new venture a success, and, of course, to continue with my modelling, as well.
