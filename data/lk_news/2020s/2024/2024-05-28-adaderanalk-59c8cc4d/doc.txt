Central Bank of Sri Lanka maintains policy interest rates

The Monetary Policy Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has decided to maintain the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) at their current levels of 8.50 per cent and 9.50 per cent, respectively.

The Board arrived at this decision, at its meeting held on 27 May 2024, after carefully assessing the current and expected macroeconomic developments and possible risks on the domestic and global fronts with a view to maintaining inflation at the targeted level of 5 per cent over the medium term while supporting the economy to reach its potential, the statement said.

While the medium term inflation outlook remains compatible with the current level of policy interest rates and inflation expectations are well anchored, the Board said it observed the need for a further reduction in market lending interest rates in line with policy interest rates and other benchmark interest rates, which is imperative for the easing of domestic monetary conditions and domestic economic recovery.
