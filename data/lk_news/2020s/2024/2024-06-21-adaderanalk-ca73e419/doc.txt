China to keep supporting Sri Lanka on debt sustainability - spokesman

China will keep supporting Sri Lanka to achieve debt sustainability as it has always been doing to help the country’s socioeconomic development, said a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman in Beijing.

Lin Jian, the spokesman, made the remarks at a regular press conference in response to a media question about the recent diplomatic consultations between China and Sri Lanka in the Chinese capital.

“On the 13th round of China-Sri Lanka diplomatic consultations, China has released a readout, which you may refer to. What I can tell you is that the Chinese side has been providing assistance to Sri Lanka’s socioeconomic development to the best of our capability.”

“We stand ready to continue to work with relevant countries and international financial institutions to support Sri Lanka’s debt sustainability,” he said.
