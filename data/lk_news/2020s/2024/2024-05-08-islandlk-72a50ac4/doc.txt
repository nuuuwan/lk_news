Heading in the right direction…

I’m a fashion model, public speaker, fitness enthusiast, and an entrepreneur, and I’ve been a cricketer, since the age of eight! Oh, by the way, my real name is Derrein, but decided to bring ‘Christian’ into my scene for work purposes…my career.

The opportunity to meet new people and hold the position of a brand ambassador, as well as my dream of being an international model and travelling the world.

I’m comparatively younger, as I’m just 20 years old, and I believe I have a good ability for speaking in public, and also my height.

My favourite genre of clothing is “the old money” style and I prefer modelling for brands, promoting such clothing, as well as fitness clothing.

05. What do you think is the most important aspect of modelling?

Definitely one’s personal confidence as it requires a model to be fully confident in themselves, physically as well as mentally, in order to represent brands and their story.

06. If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?

I would say my foot size as it is so hard to find shoes for me in Sri Lanka and 90 percent of the time I end up customizing shoes, or importing them, which I consider a hassle.

I went to St. Peter’s college Bambalapitiya and I played cricket since Grade 3. I was also in the Interact Club, senior prefect, Do You Know club, English literary and drama society, as well as compering for the media unit and participating in inter-house debates.

I would say the happiest moment of my life was the day I was selected to represent Sri Lanka for Mister International 2023 as it was the day where my A Level results were released, as well, and I found out I had got 4As.

Right now my idea of perfect happiness is being financially free and having the ability to spend time with my family and my girlfriend while doing what I enjoy doing which I am close to achieving, I would say,

Plus factors that makes Christian a top model: Height, Looks and Confidence

I am describing my girlfriend in this answer – shorter than myself, a great sense of humour, pretty of course, as well as sharing a similar view on life.

I would go with my favourite rapper Travis Scott because from his Netflix documentary I learnt about his humble beginnings and the fact that he has made such a wide global impact is something I strive to achieve one day.

There is this little toy Mercedes Benz car that I own and this was the first gift my mum ever gave me and to this day I consider it my most precious possession.

13. If you were marooned on a desert island, who would you like as your companion?

It would definitely be Kanye West, because, apart from his controversial sense of humour and view on things, I’m sure he would also find a way for us to leave the island, as he is a genius.

Probably the one time my voice cracked while I was doing the morning announcements for my entire school.

I’ve argued with my girlfriend during a certain time of the month! But, yes, I’ve also gone deep sea diving.

Probably a trip to Hawaii, enjoying the beach with friends, and family, with zero mobile devices.

I’m heavy into rap music as I’ve always found it motivational to me, as well I love learning the lyrics of my favourite songs and screaming them out loud to annoy my friends and family, and I also have a love for dramatic lyricism.

EFM because the hosts always have a very engaging and fun conversation while playing top tier music

My most watched TV station is probably Star Sports, or CNN, because I only watch TV for cricket and rugby matches, or for the news.

I am a big dreamer and I am planning some business ventures that I can manage along with my education, as well as becoming one of the biggest international models and public speakers.
