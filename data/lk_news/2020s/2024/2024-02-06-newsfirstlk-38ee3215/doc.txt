Federal Appeals Court rules Trump does not have presidential immunity

Colombo (News 1st) – Donald Trump’s hopes of avoiding a trial over alleged attempts to falsify the results of the 2020 presidential election that he lost, were dealt a serious blow on Tuesday (6th) when a Federal Court of Appeal handed down a scathing ruling that the former president does not have presidential immunity for such actions, U.S. media reported.

The federal appeals court in the District of Columbia, the nation’s capital, said his immunity claims would reject "the most fundamental check on executive power."

In addition, they said that Trump's stance "would collapse our system of separated powers by placing the President beyond the reach of all three Branches."

The all-female 3-judge bench also gave Trump very little time to appeal to the highest court in the land, with a deadline of next Monday (12th) to approach the Supreme Court to suspend their ruling. Trump’s attorneys said they would appeal.

The verdict is a major blow to Trump’s defense in the election subversion case brought against him by Special Counsel Jack Smith.

Throughout their opinion, judges Michelle Childs, Florence Pan and Karen Henderson repeatedly eviscerated former President Donald Trump’s behavior after the 2020 presidential election, as unpresidential and constituting an assault on American institutions.

“Former President Trump lacked any lawful discretionary authority to defy federal criminal law and he is answerable in court for his conduct,” the judges said.

Trump is also being separately tried by a state court in the state of Georgia on charges that he attempted to tamper with the election result in Georgia, in which he allegedly attempted to persuade state election workers to declare him the winner, when in fact Joe Biden had won the state.

He is also facing multiple criminal charges on various other matters in several states.
