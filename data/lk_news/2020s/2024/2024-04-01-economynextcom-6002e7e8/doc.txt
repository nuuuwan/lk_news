Sri Lanka optimistic about a positive outcome with bondholders: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is engaging with bondholders and is optimistic about a positive outcome, while efforts were underway to finalize in-principal deals with official creditors, State Minister for Finance Shehan Semasinghe said.

Sri Lanka was expected to meet International Monetary Fund debt restructuring requirements in the second quarter for a review to be passed by the lender’s board, he said.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said he expected debt re-structuring to be wrapped up by June–July before any elections are conducted.

Discussions with bondholders and commercial creditors are going on, and advisors are engaging he said.

China has also assured that they will work with other creditors and the IMF to support Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring efforts and economic recovery, he said.

Reforms under an IMF program, and credible economic management and decision-making by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, are bearing fruit, he said.

The rupee appreciation is bringing tangible benefits to consumers, Semasinghe said.

Under post-1978 inflationist dogma in particular, collapsing currencies are generally not encouraged to be re-appreciated under IMF programs, though reserves are collected with deflationary monetary policy, analysts say.
