Two more Director Board members of NMRA resign

Two more members of the Board of Directors of National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) have stepped down from their respective positions as directors.

Accordingly, as many as three NMRA Director Board members including Attorney-at-Law Manoj Gamage have thus far vacated their posts.

In his resignation letter submitted to Minister of Health Ramesh Pathirana, Gamage communicated his intention to step down as a Director of the NMRA with effect from today (Feb. 13).

Gamage has emphasized in the letter that as a lawyer he worked for the betterment of the NMRA during his tenure, adding that, along with fellow board members, he has taken appropriate decisions to address a number of shortcomings in the NMRA.

Slamming the conduct of the new NMRA chairman and its current administration, Gamage accused them of being part of the ‘conspiracies’ against President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the incumbent government.
