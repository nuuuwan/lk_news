Pioneering manifesto matching initiative debuts

For the first time in Sri Lanka, the public have access to a digital tool, to easily compare and evaluate the manifesto promises of the three major Presidential candidates – in English, Sinhala and Tamil.

Called Presidential Election Manifesto Match 2024, it has extracted over 1,500 promises that are tied to actions – not aspirational claims or projections.

It has a “Manifesto Comparer”, which allows the side-by-side comparison of manifesto promises of candidates across 15 thematic areas.

It also has a “Manifesto Matchmaker” game. This allows players to design their dream manifesto, and check how closely they align with specific actionable promises of the candidates.

This globally exclusive initiative was launched on the Manthri.lk platform of Verité Research. For more information, visit https://manthri.lk/en/presidential-election-manifesto-2024.
