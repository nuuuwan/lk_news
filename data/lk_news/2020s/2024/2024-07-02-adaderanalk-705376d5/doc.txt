LG Election law still in effect; Commission warns against violations

The Election Commission states that despite the deferral of the 2023 Local Government (LG) elections, the local government election law remains in effect as the polls have not been completed.

It highlighted that accordingly, the local government election law is still effective as per the Article 104 (a) of the Constitution.

Thus, the Election Commission warned that during this period, it is not permitted for anybody to act in a way that promotes any specific political party, candidate, or political group.

Furthermore, the commission has informed all the heads of public institutions through a circular and a gazette extraordinary that no state property shall be utilized for this purpose.

The election regulatory body further emphasized that the violation of these guidelines during this period is a punishable offense.

Furthermore, the commission urged all parties to comply with the provisions and circulars issued by the Election Commission in order to conduct the upcoming polls in a free and fair manner.
