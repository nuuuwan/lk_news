Aims to create more inclusive and supportive educational environment for all students

Each schoolgirl to receive Rs. 1,200 worth of vouchers over six months, starting this month

Vouchers, usable at Education Ministry-registered retailers, allow purchase of SLSI-approved sanitary napkins

Education Ministry to distribute vouchers to all provincial schools, seven national schools in estate school category

In a significant move to end period poverty, the Government yesterday launched providing free gift vouchers for the purchase of sanitary napkins for schoolgirls, starting this month.

Education Minister Susil Premajayantha spearheaded the initiative, with Rs. 1 billion allocated for the program. The initiative was officially launched at Nawala President Girlsâ€™ College yesterday.

By addressing period poverty, the Government aims to create a more inclusive and supportive educational environment for all students.

Each schoolgirl will receive a total of Rs. 1,200 worth of vouchers over six months, beginning in June 2024.

The Ministry has already established the necessary procedures to ensure the vouchers reach the students through their schools.

The gift vouchers, usable at any Ministry of Education-registered retailer, will allow students to purchase sanitary napkins approved by the Sri Lanka Standards Institute. Each schoolgirl will receive a voucher divided into two parts, each worth Rs. 600. The first part (A) is valid from 10 June 2024 to 10 July 2024, while the second part (B) can be used from 1 September 2024 to 30 September 2024.

The Education Ministry will distribute these vouchers to all provincial schools across the country and seven national schools in the estate school category.

The initiative is expected to improve school attendance among girls and prevent issues related to inadequate attention to education and health ignorance during their menstrual periods.

The Education Ministry aims to support the healthy growth and personality development of students through this sanitation program, recognising the importance of these factors in maintaining an effective teaching-learning environment in classrooms.
