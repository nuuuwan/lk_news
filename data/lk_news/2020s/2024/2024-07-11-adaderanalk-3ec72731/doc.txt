President inaugurates Kompanna Veediya flyover

President Ranil Wickremesinghe inaugurated the second phase of the flyover project today (11). This phase, constructed by the Ministry of Transport and Highways at a cost of LKR 5,278 million, spans between Kompanna Veediya and Justice Akbar Mawatha over the railway line.

The Road Development Authority, in collaboration with Maga Engineering, undertook this project to alleviate the delays and traffic congestion caused by the frequent closing of railway gates for 109 daily train journeys.

In the bustling commercial area of Kompanna Veediya, which hosts various institutions including government offices, hospitals, religious places, restaurants and cinema halls, it has been observed that nearly three hours of the day is wasted due to the closing of railway gates.

With the completion of the flyover, travel from Kompanna Veediya towards Galle Face and the Presidential Secretariat will be smooth and free of traffic jams, thereby contributing significantly to the national economy by reducing the time people spend on the road.

The inauguration ceremony was attended by Minister of Transport, Highways and Mass Media Dr. Bandula Gunawardena, Senior Advisor to the President on National security and Presidential Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, and Secretary of the Ministry of Transport and Highways Ranjith Rubasinghe.
