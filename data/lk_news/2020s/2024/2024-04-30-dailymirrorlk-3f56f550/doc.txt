Archer named in Englandâ€™s T20 World Cup squad

Apr. 30 (BBC) - Jofra Archer has been recalled to the England squad for their defence of the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and United States in June.

Fast bowler Archer, 29, will make his latest comeback from a long-standing elbow injury that has prevented him from playing for England since March 2023.

Fellow fast bowler Chris Jordan also earns a recall, but there is no place for Chris Woakes, a World Cup winner in both limited-overs formats.

Uncapped left-arm spinner Tom Hartley is included in a 15-man provisional squad, captained by Jos Buttler.

England T20 World Cup squad: Jos Buttler (capt, wk), Moeen Ali, Jofra Archer, Jonny Bairstow, Harry Brook, Sam Curran, Ben Duckett, Tom Hartley, Will Jacks, Chris Jordan, Liam Livingstone, Adil Rashid, Phil Salt, Reece Topley, Mark Wood.
