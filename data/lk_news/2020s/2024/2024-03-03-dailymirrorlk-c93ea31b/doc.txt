Save Suwaseriya by increasing salary of workers: Harsha

Colombo, March 3 (Daily Mirror)- While highlighting that the Suwaseriya ambulance service is fighting for its survival, its founder Harsha de Silva said its employee should be given a salary increment as a priority.

"The CEO of Suwaseriya is fighting to save the ambulance service. Its employees can easily obtain visas from countries like Canada. A battle is being fought to save the ambulance service in such a scenario," he told a media briefing.

He said it was most unfair for the Central Bank officials to increase their own salaries when Suwaseriya employees have not received any increments despite working 24 hours of the day," he added.
