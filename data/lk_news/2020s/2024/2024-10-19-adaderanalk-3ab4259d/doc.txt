‘Sarvajana Balaya’ launches general election campaign from Anuradhapura

The election campaign of the ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ alliance, in preparation for the upcoming general election, commenced today (19) in Anuradhapura.

Prior to the campaign’s launch, the leader of the alliance, entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera, visited the sacred Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi and Ruwanweli Maha Saya in Anuradhapura to receive blessings.

In addition to that, Jayaweera attended a meeting with the Gampaha District divisional leadership of ‘Sarvajana Balaya,’ held yesterday (18) in Kalgedihena.

During the meeting, he emphasized that his approach to politics is self-funded, stating, “We are doing politics by spending our own money, not by extorting money from others. No matter how the country’s economy develops, it’s crucial that the nation is preserved. That’s what we’re working hard for.”

He also highlighted the significance of the upcoming election, stating, “This is a golden opportunity for us. The result this time may be a surprising one.”
