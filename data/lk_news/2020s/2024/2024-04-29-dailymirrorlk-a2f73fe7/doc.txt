Political tremors expected on May Day: Ruwan

Colombo, April 28 (Daily Mirror) - Political tremors are expected on May Day (Wednesday) as members of a few political parties are expected to appear at the UNP May Day rally, UNP Deputy Leader Ruwan Wijewardene said over the weekend.

"Members of a few political parties are expected to appear at a UNP May Day rally and thus there may be political tremors on that day," Mr. Wijewardene told party activists at a meeting held in Niyagama in the Biyagama electorate.

"The UNP May Day rally should be one which sends a signal for a future political turnaround," he said.

He also said two Indian singers will also perform together with local artistes at the UNP May Day rally this year. Mr. Wijewardene recalled that late Indian queen of music Latha Mangeshkar had performed at a UNP May Day rally in the past.

"The country is gradually moving towards stability but people will reap full benefits from it only in 2025. Incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe would be a sure winner if the presidential election is held next year. However, there is no way of postponing it for next year. Therefore, the presidential election will definitely be held this year," he added.

Further he said one has to find out the sources from where SJB Leader Sajith Premadasa gets funds to distribute buses to schools and National People's Power Leader Anura Dissanayake obtained funds to bring bus loads of people for meetings.
