Felicitation of a people’s publisher and bookseller

Managing Director of Sarasavi Publishers, H D Premasiri, revolutionised the concept of selling books in Sri Lanka. Safeguarding the integrity of a potential customer, who steps into a Sarasavi Bookshop, and making him or her a loyal customer and an ambassador of Sarasavi, was his forte. He was an entrepreneur who steadily developed his business towards diversification.

His style of engaging in business would remind someone of the travelling salesman Kachchaputa, in the Serivanija Jathaka story, who practised relationship marketing, harmonised with warmth, to entice a potential customer.

H D Premasiri will be felicitated on June 25 for the unrivalled service he has rendered as a pioneer to the book publishing sector in Sri Lanka and bringing innovations to the industry for five decades. The felicitation event taking place at the BMICH will be graced by readers, authors, scholars and well-wishers.

Young Premasiri being a born marketer, innovator and a trend-setter, ventured into book selling business in 1973, and became a book publisher in 1975. The progression he had made afterwards groomed him to become a socially responsible and inventive businessman. Premasisri believes safeguarding tradition, ethics and values, in a society, whilst bringing innovations, should be any socially responsible businessman’s forte.

The Lotus Bookshop, in the heart of Nugegoda, in the 1970s, was patronized by school teachers, mothers, school going children, artistes, let alone scholars. While the rest would look for their favourite genre of books to purchase, a school going child would select a heap of Marvel comics on display, to take home. The sole proprietor of the Lotus Bookshop, H D Premasiri, would be there oftentimes greeting everyone with a friendly smile. In later years Lotus became Sarasavi and the rest is history.

Any potential buyer is treated equally inside a Sarasavi Bookshop outlet that functions with the payoff line; “Enna…Gewasenna”.  Sarasavi Bookshop outlets could be seen as a hybrid of a bookshop and a library since they are not confined to selling books. The bookshops allow prospective buyers the luxury of reading through a book of his/her choice, feeling at home, prior to making the final purchase. Sarasavi books are also sold at affordable prices. This facilitation for customers has paid dividends. A particular customer may end up buying more books that satisfy his/her whims and fancies in this homely environment. Furthermore, they would spread positive word-of-mouth on Sarasavi publishers and some of them would eventually become ambassadors, promoting their favourite Sarasavi outlet.

Sarasavi has now become a top-of-the-mind book publisher and chain of bookshops of book lovers.

Any publisher needs writers and readers to sustain and develop their business. Premasiri and his staff make healthy relationships with potential customers, let alone authors. Authors are fond of working with Sarasavi and find the place as writers’ haven. They are being paid their dues on time and their books are sold via 33 Sarasavi Bookshops throughout the country, which is the widest network of branches with a Sri Lankan book publisher. Thus the exposure to their works they derive through this strong distribution channel positions authors firmly in readers’ minds. Thus being in the Sarasavi fraternity alone adds immense reputation to a writer.

H D Premasiri is also keen in grooming up-and-coming writers to become resourceful authors. Potential writers who approach Sarasavi are required to submit their manuscripts for scrutiny to a panel of scholars and seasoned authors. The former must get the greenlight by the panel to indulge in authoring or translating books for Sarasavi. The company strictly abides by these standards with a view to maintaining its reputation as a publisher of books with style and substance.

Sarasavi publishers also cater to various segments in the society via heterogeneous marketing strategy. Sarasavi outlets at PVR Colombo, KCC and the Pelawatte outlet that sells only English books are testament.

Moreover, H D Premasiri had made a healthy rapport over the decades with Global publishers like HarperCollins, Penguin to translate their bestselling books into Sinhala. The segment of Sri Lankan readers who read translations frequently visit Sarasavi outlets to obtain translations of quality.

Premasiri, being a compassionate employer, constantly engage in looking after the welfare of his staff. No workers were terminated during the Covid-19 pandemic period that kept businessmen struggling. Premasiri’s son Chandu Haputhanthri, being an old Royalist, is entrusted with the work of adding value to Sarasavi Publishers with innovations.

Later in life H D Premasiri made emphasis on diversification of business. He thus ventured into film producing and hospitality business. The film “Yashodrara” produced by him with North Indian actors along with Sri Lankan actors was acclaimed by many. “Akasa Kusum” was an award winning film co-produced by him.

The felicitation event at the BMICH will see the launching of this multi-faceted personality called H D Premasiri’s biography compiled by veteran writer Bandara Eheliyagoda.
