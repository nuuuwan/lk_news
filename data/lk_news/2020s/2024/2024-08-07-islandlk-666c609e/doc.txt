Good Life X recently concluded the intensive residency program of the Creative Catalyst Fellowship (CCF), funded through the United States Agency for International Development-supported Promoting Positive Information (PRO-INFO) project, by bringing together ten creatives from across Sri Lanka to collaborate, experiment, and develop creative content under the theme “Climate Positive.” This two-week intensive residency took place at Diyabubula, the Barberyn Art & Jungle Hideaway, the artistic abode of the late Laki Senanayake. The residency at Diyabubula, curated by Randhula de Silva, Founder of GLX, brought together experts from various fields, including science, innovation, art, design thinking, ecology, conservation and regeneration.
