Sri Lankan women are making significant strides in the nation’s economy today, leveraging their expertise, skills, and professionalism to exceed conventional boundaries.

Their multifaceted roles within families and society are a source of pride for our nation.

The government is actively engaged in amplifying the role of women in propelling sustainable development forward. Special focus is directed towards empowering women entrepreneurs in burgeoning sectors such as digital and green economies.

Moreover, the government’s commitment to Women’s Day extends beyond mere symbolism, as evidenced by comprehensive measures aimed at safeguarding the dignity and safety of women. These initiatives include the formulation of new policies and regulations, including a groundbreaking national gender policy designed to combat discrimination against women.

The establishment of the National Commission for Women is a significant milestone in this journey, accompanied by the drafting of legislation dedicated to promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment. The completion of a five-year national action plan to prevent sexual and gender-based violence underscores our dedication to this cause.

In addition, ongoing legal reforms seek to enhance women’s representation in the political sphere, ensuring their voices are heard and respected.

As we celebrate International Women’s Day, I extend my heartfelt greetings and call upon the entire female generation to join hands in supporting our collective efforts to build a safer and more prosperous nation for future generations.
