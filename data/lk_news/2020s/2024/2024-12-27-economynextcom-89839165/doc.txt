Sri Lanka’s two millionth tourist in 2024 arrives from Bangkok on SriLankan

ECONOMYNEXT  – Sri Lanka ceremonially welcomed the two millionth tourist to arrive in the country on December 26, who arrived on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight a government statement said.

He was greeted by Deputy Minister of Tourism Ruwan Ranasinghe, along with the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, Buddhika Hewawasam.

Sri Lanka welcomed 2.3 million tourists in 2018, but the numbers fell from then on due to Easter Sunday bombings, the Covid pandemic and in 2022 due to a currency crisis coming from central bank rate cuts enforced with printed money.

As of December 26, 195,127 tourists have arrived in December alone.

Authorities expect 256,389 tourist to land in the country by the year end which will take the total for the year to 2.061 million.

Sri Lanka originally project arrivals of 2.3 million, but the shift to website operated by VFS Global, IVS-GBS, despite protests from the tourist industry against scrapping an easy-to-use existing system, led to a crisis in the sector.

The new administration carried out a court order on a case filed by the opposition to the contract awarded without tender and restored the earlier website. High fees charged by the website as well as an increase in government charges was also halted.

The statement said the government expected three million tourists in 2025. (Colombo/Dec27/2024)
