Fairly heavy showers expected in parts of the country

The Meteorology Department says showers or thundershowers will occur at times in Western province and in Galle and Matara districts.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places elsewhere of the island during the evening or night.

Fairly heavy showers above 50 mm are likely at some places in Western, Northern and Eastern provinces, it said.

The general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
