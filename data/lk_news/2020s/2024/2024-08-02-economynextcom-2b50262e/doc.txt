Sri Lanka’s controversial VFS Global visa deal suspended by top court

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s controversial IVS-GBS VFS Global visa deal awarded without a public tender has been suspended by the island’s Supreme Court after several parties filed public interest petitions.

Court has issued interim orders suspending a cabinet decision which granted deal to a private consortium, until the final determination of the case, litigants said.

Court ordered that the operation carried out by VFS global and their associates be suspended and the status quo that prevailed prior to April 17 be restored.

Prior to April 17, the Mobitel (Pvt) Ltd was operating a user friendly website through which electronic travel authorization could be applied. A tourist visa was given for 50 dollars and a 1 dollar fee.

The orders were issued by Justices, Preethi Padman Surasena, Kumuduni Wickramasinghe and Achala Wengappuli.
