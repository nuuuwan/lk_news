Fcode Labs introduces power of AI in coaching

Fcode Labs, a leading healthcare technology consultancy company, has announced the launch of Progress Magic (www.progressmagic.com) – revolutionary platform designed to supercharge mental and corporate coaching practices.

Progress Magic leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to streamline workflows, optimize client outcomes, and unlock transformative results for both coaches and their clients. The platform is secure. It’s HIPAA, GDPR, and PDPA compliant which means, it uses all the industry best practices on security and data privacy to operate in the USA, Europe, Singapore, and Sri Lanka.

The rise in mental health and corporate coaching clientele is outpacing the availability of streamlined administrative solutions. This cuts into valuable client interaction time, potentially leading to stalled progress or client abandonment. Traditional methods of scheduling, billing, and record keeping can be cumbersome, hindering coaches’ ability to deliver the highest quality care.
