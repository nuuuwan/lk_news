‘No threat to my life’: MP Harsha de Silva informs CID

Colombo, June 9 (Daily Mirror) - The Criminal Investigations Department (CID) has informed the Speaker of Parliament that SJB MP Dr. Harsha de Silva has informed them that there are no threats to his life, negating the need for an investigation.

Public Security Minister Tiran Alles earlier instructed IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon to have the CID investigate into the alleged threats to the opposition parliamentarian.

This instruction followed a claim by the Chair of the Committee on Public Finance (COPF) in parliament that he faced threats over the inquiry into the new visa issuance system controversy.

Accordingly, the CID had notified Dr. Harsha de Silva of their intent to record a statement regarding his recent claims of receiving threats.

However, Dr. de Silva, while thanking the Minister of Public Security and the CID, pointed out that his statement was made under Parliamentary Privileges and that he had assured the Speaker that there was no threat to his life.

Police said the MP emphasized there is no need for an investigation and that they would be informed if necessary.
