S. C. Mutukumarana to fill MP seat vacated by Premarathne

S. C. Mutukumarana is tipped to fill the vacancy in parliament created after the resignation of MP Uddika Premarathne earlier today (Feb.27).

The Anuradhapura District parliamentarian stepped down from his post for reasons yet to be made public.

Premarathne has thus submitted his letter of resignation to the Deputy General Secretary of Parliament Mr. Chaminda Kularatne.

Accordingly, in compliance with Section 64(1) of the Parliamentary Elections Act No. 1 of 1981, the Secretary General of the Parliament is to inform the Chairman of the Election Commission that the seat of Uddika Premarathne, Member of Parliament in the Ninth Parliament, is vacant.

Subsequently, the name of the new MP will be published in the government gazette.

Mutukumarana is next in line on the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) list for the Anuradhapura District.
