Injunction issued preventing Maithripala from functioning as SLFP chairman extended

The Colombo District Court ordered the interim injunction issued preventing former President Maithripala Sirisena from functioning as the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to be extended until May 09.

This order was issued when a case filed by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was taken up before the court today (18).

On April 04, the Colombo District Court issued an enjoining order preventing former President Maithripala Sirisena from functioning as the SLFP chairman.

Later, the SLFP’s politburo appointed Minister of Ports, Aviation and Shipping Nimal Siripala de Silva as the party’s Acting Chairman on April 08.

Earlier in March, former President Maithripala Sirisena had stirred controversy when he claimed he was aware of the true mastermind of the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks and that he was prepared to disclose the information to the judiciary if inquired from him or if an order is issued regarding the matter.

Speaking to the media in Kandy, Sirisena said that he is ready to disclose the relevant information and that at the same time, it is the responsibility of the judges to keep the information strictly confidential.
