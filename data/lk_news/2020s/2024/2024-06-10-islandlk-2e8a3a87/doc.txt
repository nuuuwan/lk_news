SLANA gets first elected female chief

Shipping and Aviation Minister, Nimal Siripala de Silva, commended the Sri Lanka Association of NVOCC agents and the Sri Lanka Logistics and Freight Forwarders Association (SLANA) for electing Swabha Wickramasinghe as their first woman chairperson.

Addressing the 7th Annual General Meeting of SLANA at the Marriot Courtyard on Friday, the minister emphasized his strong advocacy for women’s roles in various sectors.

He highlighted instances from his tenure as the Labour Minister, where despite women contributing significantly to the workforce, they were often overlooked for leadership positions, underscoring the need to address gender disparities.

Minister de Silva announced forthcoming reforms aimed at modernizing outdated Customs laws to better align with present-day demands, ensuring efficiency and effectiveness within the industry.

He expressed concern over prolonged clearance processes, citing examples of items pending clearance for over two decades, promising swift resolutions under the new system.

Under the proposed amendments, any disputes with Customs must be resolved within three months, with appeals directed to an independent tribunal. Furthermore, steps will be taken to facilitate online transactions, streamlining operations and reducing bureaucratic hurdles.

Acknowledging President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s timely interventions during economic challenges, Minister de Silva credited improved financial reserves, highlighting the shipping sector’s significant contribution to this achievement.

In her inaugural address as chairperson, Swabha Wickramasinghe expressed gratitude for the trust placed in her and outlined her vision for SLANA’s future. She emphasized the organization’s milestones, including recognition under a separate licensing category for NVOCC agents, ensuring clarity in operations and engagement with relevant authorities.

Wickramasinghe highlighted the diverse capabilities of NVOCC operators in handling various container types and their strategic role in regional and international trade, particularly in key markets like India and Russia.

Looking ahead, she stressed the importance of proactive engagement with members to address their needs and foster professional development through seminars and workshops. SLANA’s commitment to corporate social responsibility was underscored, with ongoing initiatives supporting Lady Ridgeway Children’s Hospital and plans for a mini cricket tournament to promote camaraderie among members.

Wickramasinghe extended gratitude to key stakeholders, including government bodies and private sector entities, for their continued support, emphasizing the collaborative efforts driving SLANA’s success.
