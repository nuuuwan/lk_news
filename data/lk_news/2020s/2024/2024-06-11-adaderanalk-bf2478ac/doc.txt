Court extends restraining order against Minister Wijeyadasa

The Colombo District Court has extended the restraining order issued against Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, preventing him from functioning as the Chairman and a member of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).

Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was appointed as the Acting Chairman of SLFP during an executive committee meeting held on April 21, by the partyâ€™s faction led by former President Maithripala Sirisena.

On April 24, the Colombo District Court issued an injunction order preventing Minister Wijeyadasa from functioning as the Acting Chairman of the SLFP.

The court has also issued an injunction order preventing MP Sarathie Dushmantha Mithrapala from functioning as the General Secretary of SLFP.

Meanwhile, the court had issued another injunction preventing the implementation of the decisions taken by the SLFP Acting General Secretary.

The Colombo District Judge issued these injunctions after considering a plaint submitted by Ministers Mahinda Amaraweera, Lasantha Alagiyawanna and Member of Parliament Duminda Dissanayake.

However, Minister Rajapakshe had later filed a petition with the Court of Appeal seeking to invalidate the recent order issued by the Colombo District Court preventing him from functioning as the Acting Chairman of SLFP.

On May 07, the Court of Appeal dismissed the petition filed by Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe seeking to suspend the interim injunction issued by the Colombo District Court.
