Sanath Jayasuriya appointed Sri Lanka’s head coach?

Former Sri Lanka captain Sanath Jayasuriya has been temporarily appointed as the Head Coach of the men’s national team by Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), sources told Ada Derana.

Jayasuriya will reportedly serve as the interim head coach for the upcoming home series against India and the Test tour to England.

This decision comes as SLC continues its search for a permanent replacement for former head coach Chris Silverwood.

The interim appointment follows the resignations of head coach Chris Silverwood and consultant coach Mahela Jayawardene after Sri Lanka’s underwhelming performance in the T20 World Cup held in the USA and West Indies.

Under the leadership of Wanindu Hasaranga, the team failed to advance to the Super 8 round, prompting a need for significant changes in the coaching staff.

Sri Lanka’s immediate challenge is the home series against the newly crowned T20 World Cup champions, India. The series will feature three One Day Internationals (ODIs) and three Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is).
