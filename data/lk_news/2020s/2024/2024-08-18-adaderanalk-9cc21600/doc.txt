Anura Kumara pledges to remove VAT on essential items

National People’s Power (NPP) Presidential Candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake says that steps will be taken to remove the Value Added Tax (VAT) imposed on food, health services, and school supplies after his election victory.

Speaking at a public rally in Galle yesterday (16), he emphasised the urgency of the NPP taking over the country’s leadership to address the current crises.

“NPP’s leadership is needed to pull the nation back from its critical state”, said Dissanayake.

He further stated that their recent proposal for a new electricity generation plan was presented on August 15, which aims to reduce electricity tariffs by one third and remove VAT on essential items including food, health services and school supplies in the first budget proposal itself.

NPP’s leader further criticized other candidates for focusing on their personal interests rather than prioritizing the welfare of the people.
