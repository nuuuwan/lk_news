Future government under Sajith to implement 13th Amendment

A government under him in the future will be committed to implementing the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said recently.

During the donation of a smart classroom to the Bharathipuram Maha Vidyalayam in Kilinochchi under the 'Sakwala' programme, he stated that many politicians visit Sinhalese communities, claiming to support only them, and then visit Tamil areas, making similar claims. This tactic is used to gather votes.

"While other parties spread lies in different areas, the Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) consistently advocated for implementing the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. We made this commitment across all provinces and remain determined to see it through.

"When discussing the 13th Amendment, some look away, some pretend not to hear, some chang the subject, some run away in fear, and some feel ashamed. I must say that all of them are political opportunists." he said.
