Sri Lanka focused on national unity: FM at UN Human Rights Council

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry has urged members of the UN Human Rights Council not to allow short-term political gains or “domestic vote bank politics” to overtake the work of the Council.

Sabry addressed the high-level segment of the 55th Session of the Council through a pre-recorded video statement on  Tuesday.

“In my address to HRC55 via a video message, I underlined Sri Lanka’s continuing focus and tangible steps taken in the interest of national unity and reconciliation, reaffirmed Sri Lanka’s commitment to engaging in constructive Human Rights processes while rejecting politicized and unilateral measures that infringe upon the sovereignty of Member States,” Sabry said on X (twitter).

“I stressed the fact that the  manner in which the Council approaches the humanitarian crisis in Gaza will be a litmus test to its credibility as the foremost international human rights body, and reiterated the importance of avoiding double standards being practiced in the pursuit of political agendas.”

The Foreign Minister reiterated Sri Lanka’s rejection of the HRC resolutions 46/1 and 51/1 and the external evidence gathering mechanism established by these resolutions, saying that such mechanisms are counterproductive, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.

The 55th Session of the Council takes place in Geneva from February 26 – April 5. During this Session, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights will present an oral update on Sri Lanka on March 4, as mandated by the HRC Resolution 51/1. (Colombo/Feb28/2024)
