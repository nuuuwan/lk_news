SJB to file objections to injunction preventing suspension of Sarath Fonseka

The Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) has stated before the courts that it will file objections requesting to invalidate the injunction issued preventing the suspension of Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka’s party membership and positions held in the party, and from taking disciplinary action against him.

Appearing for the Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, President’s Counsel Romesh de Silva communicated this to the Colombo District Court when a petition filed by SJB Chairman Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka in this regard was taken up this morning (04).

Accordingly, the Colombo District Judge Sandun Withana ordered the relevant objections to be taken up for consideration this afternoon.

The Colombo District Court, which considered a complaint filed by Fonsek recently, issued the relevant injunction on Leader of the SJB Sajith Premadasa, its General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara, National Organiser Tissa Attanayake and Treasurer of the party Dr. Harsha de Silva.
