Sri Lanka to impose new trade controls, make free metal scrap exports illegal

ECONOMYNEXT â€“ Sri Lanka to plans to clamp down on the exports of metal scrap and make it illegal to export items without navigating through a licensing system, a statement said.

Measures are being taken to ban the export of metal, iron, related equipment and scrap in the country, without a license, a statement from the Finance Ministry said.

In the future, all metal exports should be made only on the recommendations of the Ministry of Industry.

He had made the statement after meeting metal workers, Ministry of Industry buraucrats and Customs officials.

The ban will apply to copper, brash, aluminum, cast iron, white iron and high carbon steels.

It was not mentioned which group of citizens the ministry wanted to give an advantage at the expense of other citizens who will be at a disadvantage with the export control.

Metal scrap is collected by people in small trucks and push carts and taken to larger collectors who pay upfront cash.

It is not known how much the export ban will reduce the market price of scrap metal and discourage collection of the metals or reduce the earnings of collectors who have little political clout.

Aluminum and metal cans in particular in the environment can be repositories for dengue mosquitoes. (Colombo/June27/2024)
