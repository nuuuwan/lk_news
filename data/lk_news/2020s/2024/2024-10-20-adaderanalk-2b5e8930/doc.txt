Gammanpila sets deadline for President to release Easter attack reports

Former Member of Parliament Udaya Gammanpila says the deadline given for the President to release the two unpublished reports regarding the Easter Sunday attacks will expire at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow (21).

Speaking to the media today (20), Gammanpila stated, “The time I have given the President to release the two reports, which he is hesitant to make public regarding the Easter attack, ends at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.”

He emphasized that the President has until tomorrow morning to release the reports and fulfill the constitutional responsibility. Failure to do so, Gammanpila warned, could result in the risk of impeachment.

Gammanpila added, “If the President violates Article 38 of the Constitution and fails to release the reports by tomorrow, I will certainly make them public.”
