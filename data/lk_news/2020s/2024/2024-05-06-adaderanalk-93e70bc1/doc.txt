NBRO says landslide-prone area not linked to Uma Oya project

The National Building Research Organization (NBRO) says that the installation of related equipment to remove water trapped in the Karandagolla area in Ella has already been commenced.

Accordingly, the Director General of the NBRO, Dr. Asiri Karunawardena said that it will take about 10 days to complete this work.

However, he also said that all the necessary measures have been taken to ensure the stability of the land to release the water in the landslide-prone area.

The Director General further said that if the current landslide situation develops further, it may also pose a risk to the Ella-Wellawaya main road, and therefore priority will be given to safeguarding it.

He also mentioned that technical engineers, geologists, environmental experts and others had visited the area and conducted surveys and analyzed aerial photographs and maps while it was found that this area was previously a landslide-prone area.

The landslide-prone area has reactivated due to the heavy rainfall and it has been identified that there is no link between the landslides and the Uma Oya project.
