Sri Lanka extends expat electric vehicle import scheme to June

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Cabinet of ministers have approved the extension of an electrical vehicle import licence scheme, meant for Sri Lankan expatriates, till June 30.

The scheme was implemented on the basis that Sri Lankan expatriates make formal bank transfers of foreign remittances through licensed banks in Sri Lanka.

The President received approval from the Cabinet to submit the Import and Export Control Act No. 2 of 2024, issued under the Import and Export Control Act No. 1 of 1969, to parliament for parliament approval.

The Cabinet had previously extended a deadline given to expatriate workers who had remitted foreign exchange for the purpose of importing EVs, as amounts were insufficient to import them. The deadline was extended to September of 2023.
