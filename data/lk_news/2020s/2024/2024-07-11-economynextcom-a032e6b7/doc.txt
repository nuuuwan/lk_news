Sri Lanka to expand cinnamon cultivation with new department

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has established a Department of Cinnamon Development in Karandeniya, Galle, and awarded GAP and GI certificates to selected cinnamon entrepreneurs.

“After 200 years, we are re-establishing this department to revive the development of cinnamon cultivation in the country,” President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.

The primary responsibility of the department is to enhance cinnamon production. “Each acre of land should yield maximum productivity, and we should focus on cultivating high-quality cinnamon varieties instead of inferior ones.”

Sri Lanka’s cinnamon cultivation area needs to be expanded, Wickremesinghe said.

“The government proposes providing new land and encouraging the cultivation of cinnamon alongside other crops.” This could increase cinnamon production three to four times, he said.

The government would support local and international companies that provide expertise to enhance sales, the president said. “Increased production is futile without corresponding sales growth.”

Sri Lanka supplied the world with cinnamon centuries ago. “Now, we must return to that legacy. In the past, cinnamon was cultivated from Puttalam to Hambantota. We need to restart these activities with a strategic plan.”

“Farmers in the Hambantota district are keen to cultivate cinnamon, which can mitigate the risks posed by wild elephants,” Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries Mahinda Amaraweera said.

“There is significant demand for Sri Lankan cinnamon in Mexico and other Latin American countries, where much of it is re-exported to the United States,” Minister of Industries and Health, Dr Ramesh Pathirana said.

“Many are unaware that cassia, often substituted for cinnamon globally, can be carcinogenic. Hence, with effective marketing, Sri Lankan cinnamon can achieve higher value recognition.” (Colombo/Jul11/2024)
