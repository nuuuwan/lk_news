Rs. 3,439 million earned by exporting coconut water

Colombo, March 25 (Daily Mirror) - An income of Rs. 3,439 million was earned in February this year by exporting coconut water from Sri Lanka, the Coconut Development Authority (CDA) said.

According to the data from the CDA, the amount earned by exporting coconut water in February 2023 is Rs. 2,705 million.

There has been an increase in export income of Rs. 734 million by the pre-spring months of this year compared to last year, CDA Chairman Professor Roshan Perera said.

These facts were revealed during a discussion chaired by Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera this morning (25).

The Minister said that if it is possible to save the Rs. 300 million in coconuts that are lost annually due to damages caused by wildlife, then it will be possible to earn more income, thereby further increasing the income of coconut growers.
