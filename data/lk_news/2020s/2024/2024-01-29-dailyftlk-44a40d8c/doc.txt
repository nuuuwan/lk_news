Marikkar reveals real reasons behind parliament prorogation

Says decision to prorogue parliament was an indirect attempt to oust CoPE Chairman

Claims Govt. lacks courage to directly remove him from post despite many allegations against him

Stresses Wickremesinghe will not be able to prolong his tenure as polls cannot be postponed any longer

Vows to display where power of citizens lies on 30 January through mass demonstration organised by SJB

SJB MP S.M. Marikkar asserted yesterday that President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s abrupt decision to prorogue parliament was an indirect attempt to oust the Chairman of the Committee On Public Enterprises, Ranjith Bandara due to allegations against him, suggesting that the Government lacked the courage to directly remove him from the post.

He noted that the Government has opted for proroguing parliament as it automatically results in the cancellation of all committees, effectively removing Ranjith Bandara from his post without the need for direct action to strip him of the position.

“The second reason is that, while President Ranil Wickremesinghe is in office, the public is grappling with issues such as taxes and the high cost of living. Families are facing hardships, and many young individuals are opting to migrate abroad. Recognising that he cannot secure the Presidency through a popular vote, he aims to utilise the final throne speech in parliament to bolster his image and relish the Presidency,” the MP expressed.

The MP maintained that regardless of Wickremesinghe’s actions, he will not be able to prolong his tenure in the post for more than six months, as the elections cannot be postponed any longer.

Marikkar announced that the SJB will stage a street protest on 30 January in Colombo to voice opposition against the Government’s anti-people policies and decisions causing significant suffering. He emphasised that these protests will demonstrate the true power of the people and will be ongoing across the island. Marikkar expressed confidence that the President and the Government will grasp the ground realities by witnessing the public support for SJB organised protests.
