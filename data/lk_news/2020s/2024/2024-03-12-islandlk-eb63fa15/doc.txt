The transformative event set to be held at Waters Edge from the 13th to 15th of March, aims to bring together Sri Lanka’s marketing professionals to inspire, educate and empower, as well as explore how brands can contribute to Sri Lanka’s economic resilience and growth amidst the backdrop of a challenging few years for local markets. With 30+ international and local speakers participating in 15+ sessions covering topics such as effective storytelling, digital brand building, brand entrepreneurship, leveraging technology for personalised insights and more, the event has emerged as the premier conference on marketing in Sri Lanka. The forum has also gone a step further this year with an additional focus on inclusivity, and how branding impacts functions beyond departments, divisions, and sectors, with professionals outside the realm of marketing encouraged to attend.
