Sri Lanka’s efforts to nab overseas criminals hit a snag

Colombo, Feb 9 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka’s efforts to arrest organized criminals operating from overseas has hit a snag following the Court of Appeal in France ruling against the extradition of criminal called ‘Kudu Anju’, Daily Mirror learns.

The ruling has been communicated to the Sri Lankan authorities. However, a top official familiar with the process said the latest ruling conveyed on February 1, 2024 is not the final judgement.

“It is not the final judgement. The final ruling will be given after the judicial process is over in another couple of weeks’ time or so,” the official said.

In the meantime, the Sri Lankan Embassy in Paris is in communication with the French Foreign Affairs Ministry to get the ruling clarified further.

Earlier, Public Security Minister Tiran Alles said the government initiated a special operation to arrest 30 criminals involved in drug trafficking and criminal activities while living in countries such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and France.

That is in parallel with the Yukthiya operation which is currently in progress to control the organized criminal activities.

Asked for a comment in this regard, Minister Alles said the government would try various strategies to net all the criminals despite challenges but declined to elaborate on them.
