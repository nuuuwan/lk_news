Rice stocks for school meals program found to be substandard, PHIs allege

The stocks of rice stored in a government warehouse in the Veyangoda area, which was to be used in the meals program for schoolchildren, have been found to be substandard, the Public Health Inspectors’ Union alleges.

President of the association, Upul Rohana stated that the relevant rice stocks have become unfit for consumption due to insect damage.

It was reported that the rice stocks in question were set to be used in the school meals program implemented in collaboration with the World Food Programme (WFP), to provide free nutritious lunches for schoolchildren.

In view of the current situation, arrangements have been made to temporarily suspend the release of rice stocks from the relevant food warehouse.

“There have been numerous complaints regarding the quality of these rice stocks. Consequently, the Public Health Inspectors from the Veyangoda MOH [Office of Medical Officer of Health] have collected over 1,000 samples of rice from this store, as instructed by the Government Analyst”, Mr. Rohana said.

“The reports of these samples were received by the Veyangoda MOH yesterday.”

“According to the Government Analyst’s report, more than 50% of the samples sent were found to be damaged by insects. This has raised concerns regarding the suitability of this rice for human consumption. As a result, the distribution of rice to schools from this warehouse has been temporarily suspended”, he added.
