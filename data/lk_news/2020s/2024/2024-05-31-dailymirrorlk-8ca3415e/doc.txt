Colombo, May 31 (Daily Mirror)- The electricity sector reforms proposed in the Sri Lanka Electricity Bill will unbundle the services of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) while guaranteeing a quality supply of electricity and services, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara said today.

"If approved next week in Parliament, the electricity sector reforms proposes to unbundle the services of the CEB, establish successor companies to take over different functions to operate more efficiently and in a transparent manner, to guarantee a quality supply of electricity and services and to reduce the cost of energy to the consumer in the future," he said in a statement on X.
