Against Harin's statement, ETCA...

While condemning Minister Harin Fernandoâ€™s treasonous and unconstitutional statement, a public protest against the ETCA agreement was held in front of the Indian High Commission, Colombo today.

The protest was over the statement on selling national resources, economic and security assets for India's geopolitical interests, which makes the national economy a victim of India. Pix by Nisal Baduge
