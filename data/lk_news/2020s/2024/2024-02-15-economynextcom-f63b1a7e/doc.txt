Global growth shifts to Asia, Sri Lanka an attractive center: JICA president

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is an attractive center for economic growth, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) will continue to partner in the country’s progress, JICA President Tanaka Akihiko has said.

“Global growth has shifted to the Asia Pacific region and Sri Lanka is an attractive center of global economic growth,” he said, adding that JICA will continue to be a partner in the country’s progress, according to a statement by the Department of Government Information.

“JICA continues to support Sri Lanka’s development and reform agenda,” Akihito was quoted as saying when he met Sri Lanka’s Prime Minister Dinesh Gunwardena.

JICA will be funding a renewable energy program which includes the establishment of solar energy units in Sri Lanka’s hospitals, Minister Bandula Gunawardena said last week.

The initial phase of the Anuradhapura North Water Supply Project which was inaugurated this morning (15) was done with financial backing from JICA. The project aims to address the long-standing issue of kidney disease-afflicted regions such as Medavachchiya, Padaviya, Kabithigolleva, Horowpatana, and Kahatagasdigiliya, by ensuring access to clean drinking water.

The Prime Minister urged JICA to consider new projects to empower rural development, construction of rural roads, small and medium scale farmers and entrepreneurs, the statement said. Akihiko will be touring the island to consider future aid programs and projects.

Sri Lanka is to start more than 200 projects funded by creditors, spanning a variety of sectors, that had been halted when it declared bankruptcy in 2022. In December of 2023, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that the country looks forward to getting its bilateral creditors on board with restarting suspended loan programs. (Colombo/Feb15/2024)
