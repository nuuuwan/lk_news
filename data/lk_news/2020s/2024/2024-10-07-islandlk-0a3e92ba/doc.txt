ADB to spur low-carbon transition in Chinese industrial parks

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a $200 million loan equivalent to enhance low-carbon transition investments and climate-resilient development in industrial parks in the People’s Republic of China (PRC).

The total project cost is $602.25 million equivalent and is expected to be completed in 2031.

“ADB continues to support the PRC and its climate change commitments by catalyzing financing and strengthening institutional capacity for low-carbon transitions in carbon-intensive sectors,” said ADB Country Director for the PRC Safdar Parvez. “The project will benefit 1.5 million people working and living in industrial parks through reduced carbon emissions and improved air quality.”

Industrial parks, which are designated zones for industrial use and factories, are significant sources of carbon emissions in the PRC, as industrial  processing and activities are highly energy intensive and depend on fossil fuels. In 2020, industrial  parks consumed one-third of the country’s energy, accounting for 31% of greenhouse gas emissions.

The Promoting Industrial Park Green and Low-Carbon Development Project, a financial intermediation loan (FIL), aims to strengthen institutional capacity by  establishing and institutionalizing a transition finance system, which will provide a robust tool  and practical approach to the decarbonization of industrial parks.
