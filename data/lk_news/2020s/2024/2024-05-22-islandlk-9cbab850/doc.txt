ComBank and CBA pioneer NFC technology-enabled cashless vending machines in Sri Lanka

Offer new paradigm in convenience with contact and contactless card payment acceptance

Sri Lanka will be able to deploy its first credit and debit card-enabled vending machines following a collaboration between the Commercial Bank of Ceylon, the country’s biggest private sector bank, and Ceylon Business Appliances (CBA), a leading financial technology solutions company.

Advancing consumer convenience and embracing technological innovation, the collaboration will result in the introduction of a fully automated, Near Field Technology (NFC)-enabled vending machine service branded ‘Grab.it’ across Sri Lanka. These machines will accept contact and well as contactless card payments.

The Bank said this is the first time a Sri Lankan bank has engaged with a fintech company to offer such a technologically-advanced solution in the retail sector.

The state-of-the-art IM30 Point-of-Sale (POS) machines supplied by CBA have been seamlessly integrated into these vending machines, allowing them to accept Visa, MasterCard, UnionPay, LankaPay, and JCB cards, with payments processed by the Commercial Bank Internet Payment Gateway (IPG).
