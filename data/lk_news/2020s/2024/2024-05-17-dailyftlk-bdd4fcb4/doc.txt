Trillium Group, a leading real estate developer in Sri Lanka, yesterday began the construction for its highly anticipated project, Trillium Duplex – Colombo 5 located in the residential side of Colombo 5 on a private road called Lionel Edirisinghe Mawatha.

This marks the third real estate development Trillium has engaged in, in the Colombo 5 locality, with the other two being the Trillium Tower Colombo 5, and Trillium Havelock Residencies.

With a total project value of $ 15 million (Rs. 4.5 billion), Trillium Duplex – Colombo 5 is set to redefine urban living in the heart of Colombo being the first Duplex only Development in Colombo. The project comprises 60 luxurious duplex apartment units, offering a range of 2, 3, and 4-bedroom layouts to cater to diverse lifestyle needs. Ahead of the groundbreaking event, Trillium said that over 30% of the units have already been sold in pre-sales, indicating strong market demand and investor confidence in the project.

Trillium has partnered with San Piling Ltd., a renowned construction company, for the piling process. The contract has been awarded to Sanken Piling, with mobilisation scheduled to begin on 16 April. The piling process is estimated to take approximately four months to complete, laying the foundation for the subsequent phases of construction.
