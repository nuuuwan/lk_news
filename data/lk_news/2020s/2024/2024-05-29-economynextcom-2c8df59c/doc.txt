Sri Lanka new employment act will not prevent age discrimination: minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s new employment act that is being drafted will not include provisions against discrimination based on age, Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara said.

“Ages it can be decide by the employer,” Nanayakkara said when asked about job advertisements that specify age.

Sri Lanka is working on a revised employment act, which would address discrimination based on gender and sexual orientation.

“Right now, it’s [with] the legal draftsman,” Nanayakkara said. “We are planning on sending it this month before election.”

Nanayakkara said the new act would regulate workers in the informal sector.

““From this new employment act there is no such a burden for ladies, gents, LGBTIQ, anyone can go for any job and there will be no restriction for any,” Nanayakkara said.

However, the ministry of public administration has advertised that employees wishing to join the ministry ‘should be not more than 45 years of age.’ (Colombo/May29/2024)
