Indian Adani Group says “vicious campaign” against its Sri Lanka wind project

According to data in an Environmental Impact Assessment the Adani 250MW plant in Mannar would cost 420 million US dollars with 147 million dollars of equity (35 percent) and 273 million (65 percent) in debt.

A 100MW existing wind plant has a levellized cost of 4.6 US cents a unit over its lifetime, according to publicly disclosed data, based on an Asian Development Bank loan for the project.

Mannar has high wind potential giving 40 percent or above plant factor, pushing costs per unit down, according to industry analysts, though following a external default Sri Lanka’s risk premiums have gone up. (Colombo/Apr22/2024)
