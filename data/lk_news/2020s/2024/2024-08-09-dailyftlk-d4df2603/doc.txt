The Pharmaceutical Sector has been identified as one of the promising and emerging sectors in Sri Lanka, to promote as an export-oriented industry to earn foreign exchange. In response, the EDB has taken strategic steps to bolster marketing and promotional efforts to enhance the international profile of Sri Lankan pharmaceutical products.

In continuing this efforts, EDB with the assistance of Sri Lanka Embassy in Vietnam organized Sri Lanka country pavilion at the Medi Pharm Expo 2024 , Vietnam with the objective of providing  a powerful platform to connect across the globe, market verticals including contract manufacturing opportunities, gain industry insights and technical innovations.  Vietnam’s pharmaceutical industry is one of the highest growth markets in the region as a result of increasing economic growth, rising per capita income, and an aging population in Vietnam. The country imports around 40% of total demand of pharmaceuticals. Also in the year 2023 Vietnam imported $ 6.9 billion worth of pharmaceutical products. Sri Lankan companies are currently not exporting products to Vietnam.

The companies that participated at the 22nd Medi Pharm Expo stated that this show has provided an excellent platform for Sri Lankan pharmaceutical manufacturers to initiate business contacts with various foreign distributors and to explore the new trends available in the international market.

This year, more than 10,000 visitors from pharmaceutical distributors, hospitals and retailer pharmacies have visited at the exhibition. Further, more than 450 exhibitors from 26 countries including Vietnam, Canada, Poland, and Indonesia  also participated in the Expo.
