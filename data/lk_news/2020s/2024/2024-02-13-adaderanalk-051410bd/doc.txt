Customs impounds illegally imported readymade garments worth Rs. 150mn

Sri Lanka Customs on Tuesday (Feb.13) foiled an attempt to smuggle in 4 container loads of readymade garments worth approximately Rs. 150 million.

The shipment, falsely declared as fabric, had been sent from Malaysia. Around 44,000 readymade garments were recovered from each container.

Had the containers been cleared undetected, the government would have incurred a loss to the tune of Rs. 60 million, Customs officials revealed.

The consignees of this shipment were identified as apparel companies located in Wattala, Colombo and Panadura.
