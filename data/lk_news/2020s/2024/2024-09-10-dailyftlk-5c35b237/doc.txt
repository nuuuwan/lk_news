Hemas Holdings PLC has initiated a collaborative educational venture with the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT) to elevate the country’s healthcare education to international standards, by providing innovative nursing and allied healthcare education through the newly established entity, The SLIIT-HEMAS Allied Health Sciences Institute (SHAHSI).

Set to open doors for a new intake in October, the venture has a combined student body of over 300 students and counting.

By combining Hemas Hospitals’ extensive experience in private healthcare delivery with SLIIT’s renowned reputation for quality education, the partnership will offer a comprehensive range of programs designed to meet the growing demand for globally employable allied healthcare professionals. This collaboration marks a significant step towards addressing the critical shortage of skilled healthcare workers in the country and globally.

Designed to enhance the expertise of nurses and other healthcare professionals, the partnership will offer a robust education, bringing leading lecturers and experts in their fields to educate and train students. The initiative takes the programs a step beyond typical educational ventures, with its comprehensive industry exposure and training. The current programs are affiliated with Deakin University, Australia and Liverpool John Moores University, UK. Additionally, the nursing program is accredited by the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC) at NVQ Level 6.

In response to the significant brain drain in Sri Lanka’s healthcare sector, Hemas Hospitals is committed to nurturing the next generation of healthcare professionals. As part of its strategic initiatives, this investment in human capital aims to strengthen the country’s healthcare workforce and ensure a sustainable future for the industry.

The arena of healthcare is currently facing a global shortage of skilled workers. With a local shortage of 1,000 to 2,000 nurses annually to meet the requirements of the private sector, both Hemas Hospitals and SLIIT are uniquely positioned to address the country’s growing need for healthcare workers. With 2 state-of-the-art multi-specialty tertiary care hospitals in Wattala and Thaluwathugoda, and 43 company-owned and operated labs nationwide, Hemas stands as a significant contributor to Sri Lanka’s healthcare sector. Hemas Pharmaceuticals and Morison also stand as leaders in the pharmaceutical industry, with Hemas Pharmaceuticals as the premier distributor and Morison as Sri Lanka’s first and largest facility for manufacturing general oral solid and liquid dosage forms.

Similarly, SLIIT’s efficiency in developing curricula alongside regulatory authorities makes them the ideal partner in curating programmes to improve the study of allied healthcare sciences. SLIIT’s 25-year success as a reputed private university is clear in its student body, currently counting a population of over 25,000 and its longstanding partnerships with other globally recognised universities including Curtin, Deakin and Liverpool John Moores University.

Hemas Healthcare Sector Chairman Murtaza Esufally expressed his strong support for the partnership’s potential to transform nursing and allied health education in Sri Lanka, “Hemas Hospitals will offer promising students dedicated scholarships and guaranteed employment opportunities. By combining our expertise with SLIIT’s educational capabilities, we can create another reliable source of healthcare professionals geared for the needs of the world’s healthcare institutions to ultimately deliver better care,” he stated.

SLIIT Vice Chancellor, CEO and Professor Lalith Gamage said: “We’re very pleased to collaborate with Hemas to bring these programs to fruition. The partnership is our means of contributing to an endeavour that achieves several goals. Not only does it potentially resolve our need for a stronger body of healthcare workers, but it also demonstrates the reach and potential our nation can aspire towards through education and strategic industry collaboration. Consequently, we’re invested in seeing the efforts of this collaboration through.”
