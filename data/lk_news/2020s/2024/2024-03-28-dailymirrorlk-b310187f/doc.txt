Ven. Siridhamma Thera released from PTA charges

Colombo, March 28 (Daily Mirror) - The Colombo Chief Magistrate today ordered to release former Convenor of Inter University Bhikku Federation (IUBF) Ven. Galwewa Siridhamma Thera from a case filed for allegedly committing offences under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) during the Aragalaya protests in 2022.

Colombo Chief Magistrate Prasanna Alwis made this order considering the insufficient evidence against the suspect for charges under the PTA.

Ven. Siridhamma Thera was produced before court on November 23, 2022 after being detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) for 89 days.

On a previous occasion, former Convenor of Inter University Students' Federation (IUSF) Wasantha Mudalige was also released from the case filed against him over similar allegations. He was ordered to be released from the case after spending five months in prison.

Two student activists were detained under the PTA for 90 days under Detention Orders issued by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as the Minister of Defence.
