Final rites of State Minister Sanath Nishantha on Sunday

The final rites of the late State Minister Sanath Nishantha are scheduled to be performed on Sunday (Jan. 28).

MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said that the funeral service would be conducted in the Arachchikattuwa area.

According to the police, the state minister’s vehicle had rear-ended a moving container truck around 2:00 a.m. (25 Jan.), before crashing against the roadside barrier.

Following the fatal collision, three persons including State Minister Nishantha were rushed to the Colombo North Teaching Hospital in Ragama with critical wounds, where two of them - the lawmaker and his security guard, a police constable named Jayakody – succumbed to their injuries upon admission.

The driver of the vehicle is currently receiving medical attention at the hospital.

The group had been returning from a wedding ceremony held at a hotel in Bandarawatta, Chilaw last night when they met with the accident.
