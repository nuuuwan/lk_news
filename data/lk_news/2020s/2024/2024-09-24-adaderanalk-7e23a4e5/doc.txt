MP Vijitha Herath ordered to appear before court on Nov. 29

The Colombo High Court today (24) ordered National People’s Power (NPP) Member of Parliament Vijitha Herath to appear before the court on November 29 to testify in connection with a bribery case filed during the tenure of the previous ‘Good Governance’ Government.

When the case which had been filed by the Bribery Commission against the former Chairman of the Development Lotteries Board (DLB), Chandrawansa Pathiraja, was taken up in court today the plaintiff Vijitha Herath was scheduled to testify.

However, appearing on behalf of Vijitha Herath, Attorney-at-Law Namal Rajapaksa requested for another date to testify, due to the fact that Herath will be swearing-in as a member of the Cabinet of Ministers today. The court accepted the request and rescheduled Herath’s testimony for November 29 while ordering him to appear before the court on the said date.

The Bribery Commission has filed the case accusing Chandrawansa Pathiraja of causing a loss of Rs. 64 million to the government through a 2010 agreement made with a private company for promotional activities of the National Lotteries Board (NLB).
