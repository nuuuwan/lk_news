Unseating of Harin and Manusha

The recent Supreme Court decision to unseat two opposition MPs who had defected from their party to take up ministerial positions two years ago drew significant media attention as a court decision on these lines had not been delivered for a long time. In fact such a determination was long overdue since defections have become all too common in recent times. There are examples of some MPs continuing to hold cabinet office even with changes of government; so much so, some of these long jumpers are always on board whichever government holds office.

Another reason for the above SC decision to attract attention is that this is election time with the presidential election round the corner to be followed by a general election in the short term. Defecting MPs losing their seats by court order will have to find new coattails to cling to at the next election if they choose to remain in politics. Apart from the two MPs who lost their seats (and are now presidential advisors) there are many more defectors sitting in the incumbent parliament. They may fear a similar fate should those parties on whose ticket they were elected choose to pursue them.

There has been a lot of talk about a code of ethics for MPs which as far as I know has not yet seen the light of day. Defections, no doubt, must rank high in any such code. As it is, conscience seldom applies in these matters with self-interest predominant. It is pleasing that Ms. Thalatha Atukorale has expressed her intention to resign her parliamentary seat while quitting the SJB. But when she’ll do so is not clear. Mr. Ronnie de Mel who held the finance ministry for a record 11 years is once reported to have said he wished to serve the people regardless of which party he’s in. He had been on both sides.

The country needs an easily enforceable law to prevent the defection of MPs switching sides. This is particularly so in elections under district list proportional representation (PR) where the voter first expresses his choice of a party and thereafter a candidate preference. While legal deterrents exist on the statute, such as those that cost the aforesaid Fernando and Nanayakkara their seats, implementation is time consuming and protracted.
