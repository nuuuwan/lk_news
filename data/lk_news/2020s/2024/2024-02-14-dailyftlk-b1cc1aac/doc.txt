Accused in Atulugama child murder sentenced to 27 years in prison

The Panadura High Court yesterday handed down a sentence of 27 years of rigorous imprisonment to the defendant convicted of the May 2022 murder of a nine year old girl in Atulugama, Panadura.

The defendant faced charges of involuntary manslaughter, abduction, and attempted sexual abuse of the child.

Panadura High Court Judge Saman Kumara who delivered the sentence, also mandated the now 31-year-old convict, Farook Mohommed Ganesanathan, to pay Rs. 3 million in compensation to the deceased girl’s mother. Failure to comply with this order would result in an extension of his sentence by 78 months, as directed by the High Court Judge.

Investigations revealed that on 27 May 2022, the accused had abducted the nine year old girl who was returning from a nearby grocery store, intending to sexually assault her. However, panicked by the child’s screams, the accused suffocated her by submerging her in the mud of a nearby field. Further investigations confirmed that there was no sexual abuse involved.

The Attorney General swiftly prosecuted the suspect before the Panadura High Court within approximately six months, relying on the findings of the Bandaragama Police and Panadura Divisional Crimes Unit.

Police discovered that the accused was a close friend of the deceased girl’s father. Deputy Solicitor General Janaka Bandara, representing the prosecution, emphasised in court that the defendant’s heinous act of abducting the child of a close friend reflects the extent of violence in society. Therefore, Bandara urged the court to impose the maximum penalty on the suspect as a deterrent for others.
