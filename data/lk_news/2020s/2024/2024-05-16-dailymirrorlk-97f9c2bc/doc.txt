SLPP ready for any election: MR

Colombo, May 16 (Daily Mirror)- The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is ready to face any election, whether it is a general election or the Presidential election, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said today.

"We are ready for any election. If the general election is held first, we are ready for it. We are ready for the Presidential election also if it is held first. We have no issue about that," he told the media after an event at the SLPP headquarters.

When asked about his statement against selling national assets, he said not only he, but ninety-nine percent of the party holds that stance.

"Not only I, but 99 percent in our party is of that stance," he said.

Responding to a question whether the SLPP will not approve of the action plans of this government, he said, "We do not approve of the action plan of this government. We have a right to do so. We have our freedom. The SLPP has not betrayed its freedom to the government. We are ready to express our opinion at any time."
