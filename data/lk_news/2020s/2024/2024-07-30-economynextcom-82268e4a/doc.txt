Sri Lanka combats flight of air traffic controllers after currency crisis

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has raised the salaries of air traffic controllers to retain staff who were leaving the country after the latest currency crisis, and also started hiring, Chairman of Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd said.

“A lot of air traffic controllers left us during the Covid period, and the economic crisis, but the government has been generous to increase their salaries somewhat, and the leaving has gone down,” Chairman Athula Galketiya said.

Sri Lanka’s rupee collapsed from 200 to 360 to the US dollar in a currency crisis which ended in 2022.

The rupee collapsed steadily from 113 without a war to 300 in a series of currency crises triggered by so-called flexible inflation targeting and potential output targeting, which critics say is the worst spurious monetary doctrine to hit unfortunate nations after the basket bank crawl doctrine of the 1980s.

The government has also allowed the AASL to hire new ATCs.  However it took time for ATCs to be trained, he said.

A batch of over 25 trainees have been trained by AASL training centre and the Civil Aviation Authority and they have been released for duties.

Applications have been called for another batch of 25 trainees which are under evaluation.

It was not possible to train large numbers as the capacity to train was limited, he said. (Colombo/July30/2024)
