Sri Lanka to plant a tree to replace a tree: state minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will plant 10 lakhs of saplings to substitute for falling trees, state minister for provincial councils and local government Janaka Wakkumbura said.

“On June 5 [world environment day], we plan to implement a program to plant 10 lakhs of plants around the country,” Wakkumbura told reporters on Monday.

This announcement follows State Minister of Defense, Pramitha Bandara Tennakoon’s announcement the same day that 300 trees in Colombo are considered high risk. “Now Environment Day is coming up, and anyone can go plant a tree by the road. We have to take a decision about this. Trees should be suitable for the area. Some trees have roots that spread and damage roads, buildings. When the roots can’t go deep, they tend to topple over.”

Strong winds and heavy rains have brought down trees across power lines and transformers resulting in over 300,000 outages.

“Sri Lanka lost 19 trees in Vihara Maha Devi Park due to strong winds,” Wakkumbura said.

“In order to make up for it, we will plant a large plant for every fallen tree.”

The Colombo Municipal Council told EconomyNext late last year when a tree fell on a passenger bus and killed 5 people, that there are many who campaign against cutting trees as they are considered to have historical importance.

“Colombo is a green city with many historic trees, some of which date back to the British occupation,” Municipal Commissioner at CMC, J M Bhadranie Jayawardena, told EconomyNext in October 2023.

Colombo has many large trees, that has helped make it a greener city than most, raising questions about how to keep them safe. (Colombo/Jun3/2024)
