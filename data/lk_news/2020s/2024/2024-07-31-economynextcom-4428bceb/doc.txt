Sri Lanka’s FLiCo to retail Konka products

ECONOMYNEXT – FLiCo, a subsidiary of microfinance company Future Life Holdings, said it will be Chinese electronics manufacturer Konka’s new distribution agent in Sri Lanka.

Konka products, including TVs, refrigerators, deep freezers and washing machines, will now be accessible to consumers through FLiCo’s network across the country, the company said.

The first two Konka-branded showrooms opened last week at Maharagama and Pelawatte.

“With the unveiling of the FLiCo network, Sri Lankan consumers can now conveniently access a range of top-notch products, including the innovative and high-quality offerings from KONKA, renowned for its technological advancements and excellent value for money,” the company said in a statement.

Konka’s Senior Manager Overseas Business Division Fiona You, Regional Director Reed Lu, and Future Life Holdings directors Danushka Udugama, Sanjaya Jayaweera, and Kasun Perera were present at the launch.

The showrooms offer goods with warranties from 1-10 years, spare parts, and will restore and repair old household appliances of any model, FliCo said.

Future Life Holdings started operations in 2016 as a micro finance company and expanded into several sectors.

Its portfolio now encompasses subsidiaries operating in hospitality, retail (supermarket networks), and agro-industrial services to IT services, advertising and media, travel and tourism, consumer electronics, showrooms, and more. (Colombo/Jul31/2024)
