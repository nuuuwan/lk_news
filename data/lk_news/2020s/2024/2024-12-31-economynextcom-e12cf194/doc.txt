Sri Lanka to continue loan scheme for small paddy millers

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet has approved continuing a scheme to give pledge loans for small millers to buy paddy in 2025, Minister Nalinda Jayatissa said.

The loans will be subjected to a maximum of 50 million rupees.

They will be available to small and medium millers who can process 25 metric tonnes a day.

The millers, however, will have to purchase paddy at guaranteed prices.

Those who do not will not be eligible for this or similar concessionary schemes in the future, the minister told reporters. (Colombo/Dec31/2024)
