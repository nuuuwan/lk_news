Lakshitha Weerasinghe, top Sri Lanka power systems specialist, passes away

ECONOMYNEXT – Lakshitha Weerasinghe, Deputy General Manager, Research and Development, at state-run Ceylon Electricity Board, has passed away, friends said.

Colleagues say he had an enduring desire to reduce costs and give low prices to the public, by taking a systems approach and optimizing various options including the generation mix and emerging technologies to make the utility more cost-effective.

Weerasinghe has tried to explain the complex workings of power utilities, at various public forums, in a bid to clear up common mis-understandings about a sector that operates under multiple dynamic priorities, dynamic conditions, and technical constraints.

He has also presented papers and made presentations, at all times trying to increase public understanding by using less technical language and examples.

Weerasinghe was widely admired within the agency for the effort he took to mentor juniors, as well as his knowledge of the sector, the advocacy of evidence and logic to develop policy, and the analytical approach he took to solve problems, friends and colleagues said.

The 57-year old joined the agency in 1996, and has also worked in corporate strategy and regulatory affairs.

He is survived by a wife and daughter. Remains lie at A. F. Raymond’s Parlour, Borella till  430 pm. Cremation will take place on March 12, at 6.00pm at General Cemetery, Borella.
