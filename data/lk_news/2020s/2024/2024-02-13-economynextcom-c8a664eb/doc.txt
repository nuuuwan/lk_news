Sri Lanka’s prison inmates officially join labour workforce

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Department of Prisons and the Industrial Development Board have signed a memorandum of understanding to establish industries in all prisons.

“Through this, the incarcerated person as well as the country will get a big advantage. Inmates will be able to earn some money for the government’s expenses on their behalf during their imprisonment,” Commissioner General of Prisons, Thushara Upuldeniya was quoted in a statement.

Entrepreneurs and industrialists will now have more opportunities to establish industries in all the prisons, and the Industrial Development Board and the Prisons Department will offer certificates to the inmates who are trained in the industries, the statement by the Department of Government Information said.

“The main purpose of signing this memorandum of understanding is to make the inmates in prison a productive person for the country and the society. Entrepreneurs and industrialists are invited to set up industries in the prison premises,” Chairman of the Industrial Development Board Saranga Alahapperuma said on the IDB’s social media platform.

Developed countries often use an incarcerated workforce as a source of cheap labour. Prisoners are usually paid the minimal or nothing at all for work they do.

“This will strengthen the work currently being done by the inmates in the prisons. There are about 11,000 thousand inmates in prisons. About 5,000 of them are already engaged in various industries. With this agreement, the rest of the 6,000 can be used for industrial activities,” Upuldeniya said after signing the MoU.

“After they are released from prison, they can become a productive citizen in society by working in the industry for which they have been trained. The main purpose of this is to make the time spent in prison meaningful.”

The agreement was signed in the presence of the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, Wijayadasa Rajapaksa, by Upuldeniya and Alahapperuma.(Colombo/February13/2024)
