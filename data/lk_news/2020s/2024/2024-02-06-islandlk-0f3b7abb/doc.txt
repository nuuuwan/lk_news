2023 seen as one of the best years for Sri Lankan tourism

Sri Lankan tourism, the third highest foreign exchange earner in the country, is seeing successes in tourism arrivals as never before, even comparable to pre pandemic levels. 2018 was considered one of the best years for Sri Lankan tourism in achieving tourist arrivals but the current year with upswelling tourist arrivals has made the tourism industry experience an increase in revenue besides creating more employment opportunities, a Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTPB) press release said.

The release adds: ‘Increasing tourism attractions and initiatives implemented to encourage more tourists to Sri Lanka as one of the most renowned travel destinations in the world have resulted these accomplishments.

‘With continuous promotional efforts by Sri Lanka Tourism and stakeholders, the tourism sector has seen a considerable growth in the recent times. The year 2023 was probably one of the best years in the Sri Lanka Tourism Calendar by reaching more than 100,000 tourist arrivals each month, except in May 2023, which was 83,309. December 2023 saw the highest number of tourist arrivals in a month to the destination which hit an astounding 210,352 arrivals, making 2023 a record year of 1,487,303 arrivals, which is a testimony to the tourism sector’s future growth.

‘This can be taken as an excellent outcome after Sri Lanka Tourism went through challenges and obstacles during the past few years, such as the COVID 19 pandemic, 2019 Easter attacks and the 2022 economic crisis. Despite these challenges Sri Lanka Tourism was determined to steer ahead by spreading the positive message all across the world that, ‘’Sri Lanka is ready and safe’’. It was indeed a strenuous task to cast off all the negative impressions circulating among some media about the destination. But with the promotional efforts done by Sri Lanka Tourism, it has reached a stage where tourists would now grab every opportunity to visit Sri Lanka to experience its amazing travel and holiday opportunities and exquisite attractions.

‘Sri Lanka’s Pekoe Trail was listed as the National Geographic’s title of ‘’Best of the World for 2024’. The Pekoe Trail, which starts from Kandy and ends up in Nuwara Eliya is an exclusive opportunity to witness Sri Lanka’s beautiful central highlands by passing remote villages and lush tea estates spanning an area of approximately 200 miles. Sri Lanka was presented with the Pekoe Trail Award which was another achievement for Sri Lanka Tourism. A replica of the award was presented by the Minister of Tourism, Lands, Sports and Youth Affairs, Harin Fernando at the Brand Launch held last year to the team which contributed a great deal to receive this accolade.’
