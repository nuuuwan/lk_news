Finance Ministry can support Presidential polls with any number of candidates: Siyambalapitiya

State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya yesterday reassured the public that the Finance Ministry can support Presidential polls with any number of candidates.

He said the increase in the number of candidates for this year’s Presidential election will not pose a financial problem. Speaking to the media after an event in Yatiyanthota, the State Minister emphasised that the Government is prepared to cover the costs associated with the estimates presented for the election.

Siyambalapitiya noted that the expenditure estimate for the Presidential polls has not yet surpassed the Rs. 10 billion limit set for the event.

However, he acknowledged that if the number of candidates grows significantly, it could lead to additional expenses. “For instance, if the ballot paper needs to be extended by another page to accommodate all candidates, the cost of one candidate could increase by around Rs. 100 million due to the need for more ballot boxes and other logistical requirements,” he explained.

The State Minister assured that preparations are underway to allocate funds for any submitted estimates.

“The Election Commission has confirmed that, even after allocating funds for the current estimates, there remains a sufficient budget within the allocated Rs. 10 billion for the election. The Commission further clarified that certain expenses, such as printing, security, and transportation, are prioritised, while others, like officials’ allowances, may not require immediate disbursement,” he added.

Siyambalapitiya stressed that the Finance Ministry has no concerns about funding the election, as money will be released following the submission of expenditure reports.

When questioned by journalists about some candidates’ statements regarding their intention to call for a Parliamentary election immediately after winning the Presidential polls, Siyambalapitiya responded that funds have only been allocated specifically for this year’s Presidential election.

He expressed confidence that such an issue would not arise, stating that the current President is expected to secure victory in the election.
