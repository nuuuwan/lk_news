Sri Lanka chamber to host economic summit

ECONOMYNEXT – The Sri Lanka Economic Summit, to be held in January, will provide a platform for discussing the path forward for the country, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce said.

“The Summit will provide an essential platform for discussing the path forward at a time when Sri Lanka’s economic and political landscape has had significant changes,” the chamber said in a statement.

The summit will explore “the right policies to be implemented in achieving an export-led investment model, focusing on leveraging Sri Lanka’s strategic location, its access to rapidly growing regional markets, and the necessary domestic reforms to unlock key export sectors.

Breakout sessions will focus on tourism, agriculture and value-added manufacturing.

“After two years of economic contraction, the country is now striving for accelerated growth. With the recent conclusion of debt restructuring and the Presidential elections, and the forthcoming General Election, it is imperative to lay the groundwork for a decade of sustainable, inclusive growth starting in 2025.”

“As the nation navigates this critical period, understanding the key drivers of economic stability is essential for informed decision-making.”

The chamber’s flagship event was originally scheduled for November, but was rescheduled to January 28 and 29 due to the upcoming general election. (Colombo/Oct24/2024)
