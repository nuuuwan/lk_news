Asset and liability declarations mandatory for all General Election candidates –EC

The Election Commission announced that all candidates representing recognized political parties and independent groups contesting the upcoming general elections are required to submit their asset and liability statements along with their nomination papers.

As per Sections 80(01)(P), 82(01)(E), 82(02), 89, and 90(04) of the Anti-Corruption Act No. 9 of 2023, the declarations must reflect the candidates’ assets and liabilities as of the date on which the election poll is officially announced, the election regulatory body said.

Additionally, in compliance with Article 99A, candidates nominated for National List positions in Parliament must also submit their asset and liability statements to the Election Commission alongside their nomination documents.

The Election Commission has issued a reminder that failure to provide the required declarations along with the nomination papers will constitute a punishable offense under the law.
