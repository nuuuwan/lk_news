CoPF receives Independent Remuneration Committee report on CBSL salary hike

The Committee on Public Finance (CoPF) Chairman and MP Dr. Harsha de Silva yesterday informed Parliament that the report of the Independent Remuneration Committee appointed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to review the salary increase of officials at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has been received.

Addressing the House, he said that the report has pointed out that the salary increase of CBSL officials should not have been implemented.

The Central Bank came under Parliamentary fire over the steep salary hike. In response to the mounting pressure from MPs and the CoPF, on 1 April President Wickremesinghe, in his capacity as the Finance Minister appointed an Independent Remuneration Committee to review the salary increase of the Central Bank officials. The Committee members include; Dinesh Stephen Weerakkody, Arjuna Herath, Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, Sudharma Karunarathne, Anthony Nihal Fonseka, Anushka S. Wijesinha and Duminda Hulangamuwa.
