Sri Lanka must conclude bond exchange in December to sustain momentum: Former Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s government must conclude the bond exchange in December to sustain momentum and unlock further growth opportunities, a former state minister of finance has said.

“It is crucial for the government to conclude the bond exchange in December to sustain this momentum and unlock further growth opportunities,” Shehan Semasinghe said on X.

Sri Lanka had made remarkable progress in restoring its economy by “implementing critical decisions, including the successful conclusion of debt restructuring with bilateral and commercial creditors,” Semasinghe, who participated in discussions with the International Monetary Fund, said.

“This achievement paves the way for international rating agencies to consider a rating upgrade, boosting confidence and fostering economic stability.”

Sri Lanka has placed a borrowing limit of 4,000 billion rupees in a four month vote-on-account in case the restructuring of international sovereign bonds are delayed beyond December 31, Deputy Minister of Finance, Anil Jayantha Fernando said.

Sri Lanka expects to wrap a debt exchange by December 31, but if there is any technical delay, the vote on account provides for new bonds to be issued in 2025, Fernando told parliament Thursday. (Colombo/Dec6/2024)
