Ministry to engage children in Olympiad competitions worldwide: Minister

Colombo, March 19 (Daily Mirror) -The Education Ministry wants to involve children in competitions like Olympiads, implemented from schools level to the international level.

While participating in a prize-giving ceremony, Minister Susil Premajayantha said the Ministry has decided to provide opportunities to prepare schoolchildren and instruct all school heads through a circular.

In the upcoming education reforms, it is expected to provide wide opportunities for children to engage not only in information and communication technology but also in industrial development fields and to encourage children to do so.

The transformative change in education is expected to prepare children who leave the school system in the future to adapt to new economic trends, the Minister said.
