Spike in dengue cases amid rainy weather, health officials warn

Sri Lanka’s health authorities warn that there is a potential resurgence of dengue fever due to the ongoing rainy weather. With the monsoon season contributing to ideal breeding conditions for dengue-carrying mosquitoes, health officials are urging the public to remain vigilant.

Consultant Community Physician at the National Dengue Control Unit (NDCU) Dr. Anoja Dheerasinghe stated that a total of 40,657 dengue cases have been reported so far in 2024, with 1,247 new cases recorded in October alone. Additionally, the NDCU has confirmed 20 dengue-related deaths this year.

“The current weather conditions significantly increase the risk of dengue mosquito breeding,” Dr. Dheerasinghe explained, noting that most cases have been reported from the Colombo, Gampaha, and Kalutara districts. Other affected regions include Kandy, Ratnapura, Matara, Galle, and Matale.

Health authorities anticipate a further rise in dengue cases in the coming weeks if preventive measures are not taken, and they urge the public to eliminate potential mosquito breeding sites, especially in waterlogged areas.
