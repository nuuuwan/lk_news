US expresses concern over Sri Lanka law to police online discourse

ECONOMYNEXT – The United States has expressed concern over a controversial law to control online discourse which was passed by parliament amid opposition protests, despite last minute changes brought by the government.

“The United States remains concerned about the potential impact of Sri Lanka’s Online Safety Bill, which passed yesterday without incorporating important input from key stakeholders, including civil society and tech companies who say that this legislation threatens freedom of expression, innovation, and privacy,” US ambassador Juline Chung said in a statement on the social media platform twitter, now called ‘X’.

“In addition to jeopardizing democratic values, vague and overly restrictive legislation can hinder investment and the development of a digital economy, undermining the economic growth that Sri Lanka needs.

“The U.S. urges Sri Lanka to prioritize transparency and ensure any legislation does not stifle the voices of its people.”
