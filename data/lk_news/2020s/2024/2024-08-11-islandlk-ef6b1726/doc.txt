Testing people’s patience, the govt.’s way

The SLPP-UNP administration cuts crooked deals and protects crooks in such a way that one wonders whether it is a government of the corrupt by the corrupt for the corrupt. Lessons learnt during crises are forgotten soon afterwards. During the 2022 uprising, the unsavoury characters in the garb of government politicians who were accused of corruption and abuse of power went into hiding, but they have crawled out of the woodwork and are busy making up for lost time. They are all out to consolidate their hold on power so that they can do more of what they have been doing!

The government is fiercely resisting moves being made on the legal and political fronts to abort the on-arrival visa scam, which is considered much bigger than the Treasury bond rackets, and the sugar tax fraud. Worse, it has not fully implemented a Supreme Court (SC) order that suspended the fraudulent visa scheme. Its politicians and bureaucratic lackeys are trotting out lame excuses for the inordinate delay in implementing the court order fully. The Department of Immigration and Emigration is reported to have asked the Attorney General whether the status quo ante could be restored in view of some new regulations passed by Parliament. This reaction has come as no surprise. They are obviously acting at the behest of their political masters. In doing so, they run the risk of facing legal action. A fish is said to rot from the head down.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe himself has refused to carry out the SC interim order that an Acting IGP be appointed. Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena has audaciously claimed that the SC order restraining IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon from functioning as the IGP is not valid. We are in a situation where the President and the Prime Minister review the apex court orders! The Bar Association of Sri Lanka, the Opposition and prodemocracy groups have rightly condemned the government for falsely claiming that the SC is not constitutionally empowered to scrutinise appointments made by the President and approved by the Constitutional Council.

Government politicians and their servile bureaucrats try every trick in the book not to implement judicial decisions that are not favourable to them. They take cover behind Parliament to justify their sordid operations. In doing so, they give a fillip to the erosion of public faith in the legislature.

Parliament is abused by governments to give their illegal deals a veneer of legitimacy. The absence of constitutional provision for the post-enactment judicial review of legislation has stood corrupt regimes in good stead. What is passed by Parliament becomes a fait accompli. Hence, politicians in power abuse their parliamentary majorities to steamroller bad bills, etc., through the House in the most despicable manner amidst protests from the Opposition. In January 2024, the incumbent government hit a new low in Parliament by deeming the Online Safety Bill ratified during a din in the House. It got cold feet thereafter in view of the Opposition’s threat to internationalise the issue, and agreed to amend the controversial law.

The BASL has said in a statement condemning the government over the IGP issue: “It is essential for the Rule of Law and the independence of the judiciary that the executive and legislature respect the judgments of the courts of the land. Failure to honour the decisions of the courts of the land by the Government will result in a loss of public confidence in the administration of justice and will seriously imperil democracy.”

Reports of the delay in implementing the SC interim order anent the questionable online visa scheme have come at a time when the government MPs are out for JVP/NPP stalwart K. D. Lalkantha’s scalp over his recent statement that the JVP tried to lead the Aragalaya protesters to Parliament albeit unsuccessfully, in 2022. Some MPs have even called for his arrest. Corrupt politicians who are abusing Parliament to compass their political ends thereby causing the people’s trust therein to erode ought to realise that the day may not be far off when they will face a situation similar to that in Bangladesh.
