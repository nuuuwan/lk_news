Sri Lanka cuts onion protectionist tax by Rs70 after India export ban

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has cut a protectionist 80 rupee a kilo tax on big onions to 10 rupees after India banned the export of b-onion allowing ‘rose onions’ to be imported, State Minister for Finance, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

The domestic price of big onions has risen steeply after India banned the export of onions and the tax cut will not reduce the profits of farmers, Minister Siyambalapitiya said.

The taxes were cut through a gazette notice issued at midnight through a Special Commodity Levy Act.

Rose Onion is a large onion similar to the big onions imported and consumed in Sri Lanka, he said. (Colombo/Mar28/2024)
