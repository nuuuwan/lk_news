Sri Lanka to present three month mini-budget: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will present a vote-on-account for three months as there would not be enough time to present a full year budget after elections, Minister Vijitha Herath said.

“We are now expecting to present a vote on account,” Herath told reporters at the weekly cabinet press briefing.

“After the elections the Parliament is due to meet on November 21. There is no time to present a budget for the next year in December itself. So the idea now is to present a vote-on-account.

Sri Lanka usually present a budget for the following year in November.

Sri Lanka is also planning to go to Washington and meet International Monetary Fund officials late this month, and will negotiate tax cuts with the agency in the future, he said. (Colombo/Oct15/2024)
