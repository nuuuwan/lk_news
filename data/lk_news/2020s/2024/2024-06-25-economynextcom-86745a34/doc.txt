Sri Lanka to call bids for new O&M contractor for Mannar wind farm

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will call call competitive bids to select a new operation and maintenance contractor for Ceylon Electricity Board’s ‘Thambapavahini’ wind farm, cabinet spokesman minister Bandula Gunawardena said.

The existing O&M contract with Vestas Wind Lanka (Pvt) Limited for three years had ended in May this year.

“Therefore, a new service provider should be selected for those functions,” Minister Gunawardana said.

“Accordingly, the Cabinet approved the proposal presented by the Minister of Power and Energy to select a suitable service provider following a competitive procurement process.”

Situated on Mannar Island in Sri Lanka’s north west coast, Thambapavani is the country’s largest wind farm.
