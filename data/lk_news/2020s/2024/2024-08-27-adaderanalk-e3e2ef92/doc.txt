SLPP MP and several former LG members pledge support to President Ranil

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MP Wimalaweera Dissanayake has met with President Ranil Wickremesinghe along with several local government representatives and extended their support to President in the upcoming presidential election.

The local government representatives including former Chairman of Uhana Pradesdhiya Sabha Upul Priyantha, former Vice Chairman Jagath Deshapriya, former Chairman of Dehiattakandiya Pradeshiya Sabha Sugath Jathungaarachchi, and former Chairman of Mahaoya Pradeshiya Sabha Indika Nilantha have met with the President at his office on Flower Road, Colombo, last afternoon (26).

SLPP MP for Digamadulla District Wimalaweera Dissanayake warned that if President Ranil Wickremesinghe is not reappointed for the next five years, Sri Lanka could experience severe repercussions akin to those in Bangladesh.

He cited potential outcomes such as increased street violence, attacks on religious sites, court closures, and the dismantling of the constitution.

MP Wimalaweera has expressed his commitment to support President Wickremesingheâ€™s re-election, setting aside his personal opinions for the greater good of the country.

In a subsequent media discussion, MP Dissanayake emphasized that his support does not represent a departure from his party but is a strategic decision made in the interest of the country and its people.
