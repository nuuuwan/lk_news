“He will subsequently take up several executive leadership roles within the institutional framework related to the digital economy following relevant legislative enactment.”

“These include Secretary of a newly constituted Ministry of Digital Economy under the direct purview of the President, and Chair of the Digital Economy Authority, an apex body that will be mandated to oversee Digital Economy Acceleration.” (Colombo/November 1/2024)
