The Speaker of Parliament yesterday (04) presented the Supreme Court’s determination regarding the proposed the “Sri Lanka Electricity Bill” which was recently submitted by the government.

The Supreme Court informed Parliament that several clauses of the Electricity Bill do not comply with the Constitution. These clauses must be approved by a special majority in Parliament, and one clause must also be approved by a referendum, the country’s apex court ruled.

Presenting the Supreme Court’s decision on the bill to the House, the Speaker said that if the relevant clauses are amended, the bill can be passed by a simple majority in Parliament.
