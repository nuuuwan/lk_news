Sri Lanka SOEs major source of corruption

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s state-owned enterprises are a major source of corruption, and are beset by bad governance and some are operating with special privileges and monopoly power, a think tank said.

“State-owned enterprises are a major source of corruption vulnerabilities in Sri Lanka,” Rehana Thowfeek, research consultant at Advocata Institute said.

“I don’t think there’s anyone who can deny that. They distort markets.”

In Sri Lanka, SOEs dominate key sectors like banking, energy, telecommunications; and often times there is very little competition with them becoming forced monopolies, she said.

“Everything can’t be privatised, we know,” Dhananath Fernando, chief executive officer of Advocata, said. “Some have to become public-private partnerships, some have to be managed by regulating them.”

“We have created a state owned enterprise policy which has been approved by the cabinet,” Suresh Shah, Director General of the State Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit, said.

The IMF’s Governance Diagnostic Assessment flags SOEs as being high-risk for corruption, plagued by weak management, shoddy oversight, rigged procurement processes, political interference, and a lack of transparency.

“We are putting the policy into a law, a draft of a law has been done which clearly lays out how you take political interference out of board appointments for example, how do you treat subsidies, what disclosure requirements are necessary, what kind of board members should be appointed… it’s based around 9 principles.” (Colombo/Aug19/2024)
