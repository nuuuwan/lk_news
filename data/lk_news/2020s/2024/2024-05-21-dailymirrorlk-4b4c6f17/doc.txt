Diana Gamage granted bail

Colombo, May 21 (Daily Mirror) - Former State Minister Diana Gamage was today ordered to be released on bail after she appeared before the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court in connection with a magisterial inquiry over a complaint that she had obtained a Sri Lankan passport after furnishing false information.

Colombo Chief Magistrate Thilina Gamage ordered the release of Diana Gamage on a cash bail of Rs. 500,000, with two sureties of Rs. 1 million. He observed that there is no material to prove that the suspect will evade the magisterial inquiry.

The CID conducting investigations into this matter has already named Diana Gamage as a suspect.

In 2021, the CID had filed a B report before the Chief Magistrateâ€™s Court against Diana Gamage over a complaint that she is a British citizen residing in Sri Lanka without a dual citizenship status.

The CID had commenced investigations into this incident subsequent to a complaint lodged by social activist Oshala Herath.
