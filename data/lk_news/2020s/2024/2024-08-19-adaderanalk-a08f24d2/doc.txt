MPs who left the party can come back any time - Namal

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) presidential candidate Namal Rajapaksa says that he will revive efforts to crown Hambanthota as a hub of aviation and naval affairs in South Asia.

He made these remarks during his visit to the Tissamaharama Raja Maha Viharaya to invoke blessings on Sunday (18). He was accompanied by several other lawmakers including Chamal Rajapaksa and State Minister of Power and Energy, D.V. Chanaka.

“We implemented measures to turn Hambanthota into an aviation and naval hub.  Unfortunately, the good governance government put an end to those measures.  After the 22nd of September, we expect to turn hambanthota into South Asia’s hub of aviation and naval affairs once again, creating close to a million direct and indirect employment opportunities”, Rajapaksa claimed.

Meanwhile, responding to a question raised by a journalist regarding the rumours that certain MPs who left the party are going to rejoin it, Namal Rajapaksa stated that what matters more than the politicians’ decision, is the political decisions of the public.

Rajapaksa also expressed that even though, higher ups change their allegiances for positions and privileges, the loyalists in the grass-roots level remain with the party. However, he further mentioned that those who left can come back to the party at any time.

Furthermore, the SLPP’s presidential candidate said: “This is your election. This is the political movement you trust.  This is the party of your beloved leader. Let’s work to ensure that the policies we believe in, win in the upcoming election. The SLPP will definitely win this election.”
