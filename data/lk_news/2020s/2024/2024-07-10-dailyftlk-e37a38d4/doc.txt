IGP confident in apprehending all Club Wasantha murder suspects soon

Inspector General of Police Deshabandu Tennekoon in a statement yesterday expressed his confidence that investigators will be able to apprehend all suspects connected to the killing of Surendra Wasantha Perera alias Club Wasantha.

According to Tennekoon, investigators have already gathered significant information about those involved in the crime. “Investigations are now focusing on determining whose instructions the perpetrators followed and the motives behind the killing,” Tennekoon said.

The IGP confirmed that the police have already uncovered the mastermind behind the killing. “We are confident that this crime will be solved in a short period of time, and the criminals will be brought to justice,” he said confidently.

The IGP noted that a nationwide program to combat drugs and underworld activities has been implemented due to the prevailing situation in the country. He mentioned that previously seven or eight people were shot and killed in a single day, highlighting the severity of the situation.

“It has been two and a half months since a crime was committed using automatic weapons. Illegal firearms continue to circulate in society. That’s why our focus remains on apprehending illegal firearms through operations like Yukthiya,” he noted.

The police have discovered that two underworld figures known as Loku Patty and Gona Kovile Shantha, currently in hiding in Dubai, directly orchestrated the operation to kill Club Wasantha.
