Measures being taken to address issues related to tax registration

COLOMBO (News 1st); State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said although measures have been taken to provide a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) for all citizens above 18 years of age, several issues have been identified in this regard.

The State Minister said the lack of equipment and human resources at the Inland Revenue Department are among the identified issues.

During a review meeting held at the President's Office last week, permission was granted to hire personnel for the Inland Revenue Department and to hire university graduates as trainees with a fair payment, as a solution to these issues.

State Minister Siyambalapitiya said measures were taken to ensure the tax registration and related work will not be disrupted.

He added that measures will be taken to issue the Taxpayer Identification Number using data collected by the Department for Registration of Persons and the Department of Motor Traffic.
