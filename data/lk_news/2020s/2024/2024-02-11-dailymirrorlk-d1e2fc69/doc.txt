Dushmantha Chameera ruled out of 2nd ODI against Afghanistan

Kandy, Feb 11 (Daily Mirror) - Dushmantha Chameera will miss Sri Lanka's second ODI against Afghanistan, with Asitha Fernando coming into the squad as his replacement.

Sri Lanka Cricket stated that Chameera limped off midway through his eighth over during Sri Lanka's 42-run victory in the first ODI. Despite picking up two wickets at the time, he was unable to continue due to an injury to his left quadriceps.

The injury is confirmed to be unrelated to any of his previous ailments; last year, he missed a significant portion of Sri Lanka's games due to a torn pectoral muscle, and prior to that, he underwent surgery for an ankle injury.
