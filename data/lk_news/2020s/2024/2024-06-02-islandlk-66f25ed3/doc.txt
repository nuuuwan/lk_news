THE HEALING CUT: extraordinary surgical triumphs

In the grand tapestry of medical literature, every so often, a piece of work emerges that transcends the boundaries of conventional narratives and takes its reader on a journey through the intricacies of human anatomy, the challenges of surgical prowess, and the triumphs of unwavering spirit. ‘THE HEALING CUT’ is one such magnum opus, penned by a surgeon whose life experiences resonate not only with the precision of a skilled specialist but also with the grace of a true storyteller.

Dr. Gamini Goonetilleke, the author of this remarkable odyssey, is not merely a surgeon; he is a maestro who once graced the rugby field as a nippy scrum half, displaying eagle-eyed acuity, and quick decision-making abilities that would later become the hallmarks of his surgical career. The same cognitive power, skills, and dexterity that marked his sporting days are palpable in the pages that unfold his extraordinary journey through healing institutions in Polonnaruwa, Jaffna, Gampaha, and Kotte.

In the crucible of these diverse institutions, Dr. Goonetilleke’s experiences were forged with a unique amalgam of suffering, skill, dexterity, and spiritual strength. It is from this crucible that this ‘one of a kind’ medical odyssey – ‘THE HEALING CUT’ emerged. His strong Catholic upbringing, evident through expressions of firm reliance on the Lord, adds a layer of admirable humility to this narrative.

Much like Odysseus in Homer’s epic, Dr. Goonetilleke undertook a two-decade-long journey through war-torn areas, displaying surgical exploits in trauma and military surgery. Now, having replaced the blood red scalpel with a black ink pen, he shares his encounters restoring God’s battered masterpieces in his care, which were created with such love and embodying such artistry. Through the imperfections he saw the outline of the original masterpiece which he relentlessly pursued to protect and restore, while enhancing the medical services of particularly the less privileged communities in the back of beyond.

The book’s layout, akin to the sections of a symphony, begins with a crescendo of trauma – beyond the norm. The reader is transported into a myriad of life situations impacting farming and village life, encountering surgical injuries from wild animal attacks, social upheavals, and the haunting aftermath of war. The vivid descriptions of injuries from mortars, antipersonnel mines, and bomb blasts, often absent in standard surgical textbooks, captivate the reader’s imagination.

Armed with a rich collection of illustrations and photographs capturing different stages of unusual surgical manifestations and injuries, many documented for the first time in the history of surgery in Sri Lanka, the author guides the reader through the challenges he faced. His penchant for precision and clarity manifests itself clearly as he the teacher, next guides the reader, particularly those in the field of medicine, through a spectrum of visually arresting surgical experiences categorized by their anatomical locations. An ideal ‘dive and retrieve’ bonus for the student in surgery.

As the narrative continues, the author switches to a more contemplative mode with the documentation of five of life’s unforgettable episodes within and beyond the hospital walls, which seem to have made indelible impressions in his mind. ‘THE HEALING CUT’ completes the incision reaching its climax, as it delves into the poignant realm titled – from the operating room to the heart: two touching ‘patient experiences’ that finally ground the reader after a surreal journey.

Yet, this book is more than a narrative. It is a call to action. Dr. Goonetilleke sounds a clarion call to future generations of doctors, urging them to awaken from their professional slumber. He challenges them to break free from comfort zones and innovate and improvise in less endowed and far-flung units of health. In a world where modern technology reigns, his words serve as a reminder that true healing extends beyond machines—it resides in the dedication, innovation, and compassion of those who answer medicine’s noble calling.

As a Professor of Anatomy, I find myself enthralled by Dr. Goonetilleke’s journey, for it not only illuminates the intricate tapestry of human anatomy but also celebrates the resilience of the human spirit. ‘THE HEALING CUT’ is a testament to the artistry of surgery, the poetry of healing, and the enduring spirit of a surgeon whose odyssey invites us all to explore the depths of our humanity.
