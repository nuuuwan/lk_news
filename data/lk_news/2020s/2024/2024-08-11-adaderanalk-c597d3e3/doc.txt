Prison guard arrested with weapons, ammo and drugs linked to “Gotha Asanka”

The weapons and ammunition taken into custody along with a prison officer during a raid in the Rajagiriya area last night (10), have been revealed to allegedly belong to the notorious criminal figure and large-scale drug trafficker infamously known as “Gotha Asanka,” who is currently hiding overseas.

The weapons were discovered hidden in a bunker on the upper floor of the prison officer’s house in Rajagiriya, during a raid carried out by the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB).

The raid has been carried out based on certain information uncovered during the interrogations of seven individuals who were arrested with live ammunition and drugs in the Makola area recently.

Based on the relevant information, police had searched the two-story house which was under construction in the Madinnagoda, Rajagiriya.

During the raid, police officers had uncovered the hidden bunker on the upper floor of the house where they discovered a large cache of weapons including T-56 rifle with magazine, a micro pistol, over 400 rounds of live ammunition including T56 and 9mm bullets, 06 grams of heroin, 700 milligrams of cannabis and 200 milligrams of Kush cannabis.

The 44-year-old prison guard, who is the owner of the house, was arrested while he has admitted that the weapons belong to the notorious criminal and drug dealer knows as “Gotha Asanka”.

Police suspect these weapons may have been used in various crimes in the Colombo suburbs.
