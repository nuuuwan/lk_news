Sabry convenes inaugural meeting of Inter-Ministerial Standing Committee on Human Rights

Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry chaired the inaugural meeting of the Inter-Ministerial Standing Committee on Human Rights at the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday, 13 February 2024, with the participation of Foreign Secretary Aruni Wijewardane and Government officials representing 16-line Ministries and agencies.

Foreign Minister Sabry highlighted that the establishment of the Inter-Ministerial Standing Committee on Human Right demonstrates the commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) to upholding human rights, fostering reconciliation, and ensuring the fulfilment of its voluntary international obligations.

Minister Sabry further emphasised that Sri Lanka will continue to engage constructively with the United Nations and remains committed to pursuing tangible progress on reconciliation and human rights through domestic institutions while preserving its sovereignty.

Foreign Secretary Wijewardane addressing the meeting underscored the importance of the Inter-Ministerial Standing Committee as a standing national framework to effectively coordinate GoSL response to an increasing volume of reporting obligations to the UN human rights mechanisms including to the Human Rights Council (HRC), the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), Special Procedures Mandate Holders (SPMHs) and Treaty Bodies.

Secretary Wijewardane provided an overview on the structure of the inter-Ministerial Standing Committee which operates as a two-tier process, consisting of 21 Government line agencies.

The United Nations and Human Rights Division provided an update on the status of reporting obligations under the international human rights conventions to which Sri Lanka is a party.

The Inter-Ministerial Standing Committee (IMSC) on Human Rights which was established pursuant to approval of the Cabinet of Ministers on 11 December 2023, is envisaged as a standing national framework to ensure efficient coordination and reporting on Sri Lankaâ€™s voluntary international commitments regarding human rights and reconciliation. The Committee operates as a two-tier process. The first tier is the high-level Committee chaired by Minister of Foreign Affairs which is convened every four months as needed and makes policy decisions on matters of high priority and significance. The second tier is the senior official level Committee, chaired by Foreign Secretary which monitors progress and meets on a monthly basis as required. According to this process, each Government line Ministry or agency will nominate a focal point to this Committee and provide updates on progress in respective areas coming under the purview of their respective Ministry or institution.

During the discussion that followed the presentation, the officials who attended the meeting appreciated this initiative of the Foreign Ministry and expressed their willingness to cooperate in this process.
