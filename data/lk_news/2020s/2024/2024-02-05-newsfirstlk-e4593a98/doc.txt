TISL slams “outrageous” passage of Online Safety Act

COLOMBO (News 1st); Transparency International Sri Lanka expressed its outrage at the government's passage of the Online Safety Act, despite failing to implement crucial amendments mandated by the Supreme Court.

In a statement, Transparency International Sri Lanka said: "We are appalled by the outrageous conduct of the Government, Parliament, Attorney General, and the Speaker in signing off on a version of the Online Safety Act that does not contain several of the amendments required by the Supreme Court in its determination on the bill."

The organization went on to criticize the move as a "blatant violation of the Constitutional safeguard" provided for citizens to seek the redress of the court against the attempts of the legislature to impose unconstitutional laws.

They condemned it as an "unprecedented abuse of power by the legislature" and demanded immediate corrective action.
