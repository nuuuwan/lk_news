Experts described Hasina’s visit to China as a journey of cooperation and friendship.

Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the two countries have always respected and supported each other, treated each other as equals, and cooperated for win-win results, setting an example of friendly exchanges and mutually beneficial cooperation between countries, especially between the “Global South.”

China cherishes the profound friendship established by the older generation of leaders of China and Bangladesh, and is willing to take the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations next year as an opportunity to deepen the high-quality joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and expand the depth and breadth of cooperation in various fields, Xi said.

Xi stressed that China supports Bangladesh in adhering to an independent foreign policy, following a development path that suits its national conditions, safeguarding national sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, and opposing any external interference.

Hasina said that Bangladesh firmly adheres to the one-China principle, supports China’s stance on the Taiwan question, resolutely opposes external forces’ interference in China’s internal affairs, and firmly supports China in safeguarding its core interests.

The Chinese Premier Li Qiang also met with Hasina. According to the Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS), the country’s national news agency, the two countries have signed 21 instruments including two renewed MoUs and announced seven more projects.
