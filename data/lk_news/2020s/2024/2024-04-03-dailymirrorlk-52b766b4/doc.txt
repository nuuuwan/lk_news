Students to get driving license without written tests

Colombo, April 3 (Daily Mirror) - Every GCE Advanced Level student who receives the driving skill medal given by the School Road Safety Association is eligible to take the practical test without sitting for the written examination conducted by the Department of Motor Traffic, Transport State Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said.

The programme of setting up school road safety forums and awarding medals is scheduled to be implemented today and students from the primary to the advanced level will have the opportunity to participate.

These forums will also set up a system to offer more points to the students who work up to the President's Medal when qualifying for the universities than other students who are selected for the universities.

The Minister further said that the method of awarding these medals is to be implemented under the supervision of the school as well as divisional level officials.

He also said a circular related to this will be issued by the Education Minister.
