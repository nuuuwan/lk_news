President, Mahinda, Basil talks end with no decision on alliance

Colombo, March 8 (Daily Mirror) - The meeting among President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) leaders Mahinda Rajapaksa and Basil Rajapaksa ended with no final decision on the formation of an alliance ahead of the pending national elections, Daily Mirror learns .

The three leaders met yesterday to discuss outstanding political matters ahead of the presidential elections slated to be conducted later this year .

Daily Mirror learns that the two SLPP leaders sought clarity on two policy matters - alienation of national assets and power devolution - from the President to decide on the party’s stand to forge an alliance.

The SLPP believes its leader Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa only brought the state institutions such as SriLankan Airlines and Sri Lanka Insurance under the purview of the government during his presidency. The party appears to be sticking to its original ideology in this regard. It seeks some compromise on the part of the President in his plan for restructuring them.

They also reportedly raised concerns about the proposed contours of power devolution to resolve the political question of northern and eastern provinces.

However, the two parties decided to accelerate their political activities and decide on final decisions depending on how far they can find common ground on areas of each other’s concern .
