Sri Lanka UDA leases Kollupitiya land to Expo Property Developers

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Urban Development Authority will lease a 52-perch land belonging to it at Kollupitiya to Expo Property Developers (Pvt) Ltd for a housing project, a government statement said.

Cabinet approved the proposal “to transfer the relevant portion of land to the Expo Property Developers (Pvt) Ltd under 99 years lease basis on the current assessment of the chief assessor.”

Approval was initially given in 2007 to lease 40 perches in the Marine Drive area on a 50-year long-term basis, as per the provisions of the Urban Development Authority Act.

An amount equal to 25 percent of the value of the land had been charged, “However, functions relevant to transferring of the land cannot be completed due to residing of unauthorized person.”

Expo Property Developers had requested for 52 perches of land including 12 perches adjacent to the said land to implement a housing project on a 99-year lease basis.

“The approval of the Board of Management of the Urban Development Authority has been received for that purpose.”

Established in 1998, Expo Property Developers is a condominium development enterprise. Its projects include Expo the Grand Tower 1, Expo Grand Tower 2, Colombo Central Tower, and Victoria Towers in Colombo. (Colombo/Jul12/2024)
