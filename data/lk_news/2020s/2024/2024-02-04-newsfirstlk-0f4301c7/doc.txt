Singaporean TikTok CEO Denies Chinese Communist Party Ties

(BBC) â€“ US Senator Tom Cotton repeatedly asked Shou Zi Chew, the CEO of Chinese-owned social media app TikTok, about his links to the Chinese Communist Party, despite Mr Chew repeatedly asserting that he is Singaporean at a hearing in Washington DC on Wednesday.

In this minute-long exchange, Mr Cotton asks Mr Chew about his citizenship, passport and whether he is a member of the CCP, to which he replies "Senator, I'm Singaporean. No."

Chew denies his company has ever shared or received a request to share US users' data with the Chinese government.

Chew faced the hearing in the US Senate alongside CEOs from Meta, X and other social media companies who were grilled by the US lawmakers over the dangers that children and teens face using the social media platforms.

The executives testified before the US Senate Judiciary Committee amidst a torrent of anger from both parents & lawmakers that companies are not doing enough to thwart online dangers for children, such as blocking sexual predators and preventing from suicide.
