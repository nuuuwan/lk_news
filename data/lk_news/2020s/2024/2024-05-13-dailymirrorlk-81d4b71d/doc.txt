Restructuring of CEB will continue despite MRâ€™s statement on privatisation: Minister

Parliament, May 13 (Daily Mirror)- Restructuring of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) will continue as former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has not requested for such a thing, Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera told Parliament today.

"Mahinda Rajapaksa has not requested for the postponement of the restructuring of state enterprises. He has only asked for the postponement of selling state enterprises. We have no intention of selling the CEB. The restructuring of the CEB will continue, " Minister Wijesekera said.

The Minister was responding to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella to this effect.

MP Kiriella was referring to a letter sent by Rajapaksa to President Wickremesinghe asking him to stop privatizing state enterprises.

"We would like to know whether Minister Wijesekera is with President Wickremesinghe or with Mahinda Rajapaksa," he questioned.
