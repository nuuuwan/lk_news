Weather advisory issued for heavy rain

The Meteorology Department has issued an advisory for heavy rain for Central, Sabaragamuwa, Uva provinces and in Galle, Matara and Kaluthara districts.

Due to a low-level atmospheric disturbance in the vicinity of Sri Lanka, showery conditions are expected to enhance during the next few days, the advisory says.

Heavy rainfall above 100 mm can be expected at some places in Central, Sabaragamuwa and Uva provinces and in Galle, Matara and Kaluthara districts.

The general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
