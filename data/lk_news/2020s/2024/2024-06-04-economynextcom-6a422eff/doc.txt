Sri Lanka’s new Electricity Bill ruled unconstitutional by top Court

ECONOMYNEXT – A bill to reform Sri Lanka’s Electricity law was ruled inconsistent “as a whole” with article 12 (1) of the Constitution by the Supreme Court, Speaker Mahinda Abeywardana said.

Several other articles of the bill were also ruled inconsistent with the constitution, he said.

However, the Supreme Court has suggested several amendments to enable the bill to be passed with a simple majority.

Opposition Chief Whip, Lakshman Kiriella requested that the bill be referred to the relevant committee and debate delayed to make sure the appropriate changes are made.

Sri Lanka’s opposition has charged that the government has amended bills in the past in ways which were not in line with the Supreme Court’s suggestion, and unconstitutional bills are in force.

Power Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said the bill can be debated on June 06 as scheduled, with the appropriate changes.

Other legislators also asked for more time to study the changes.

Sri Lanka has no post-enactment judicial review and the question of passing unconstitutional laws by rejecting amendments suggested by the opposition or the court has become a rising controversy. (Colombo/June4/2024)
