TNA accepts President’s invitation for discussion with IMF

The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) has confirmed its acceptance of President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s invitation to opposition political parties for discussions with representatives of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

According to Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi (ITAK) leader S. Shritharan, TNA leader R. Sampanthan is slated to participate in the discussion scheduled to be held at the Presidential Secretariat on Monday (11 March).

While invitations were extended to various opposition parties, it has been noted that the Samagi Jana Balawega (SJB) and the National People’s Power (NPP) have opted not to participate in the dialogue.

While the discussion in question will be taking place as per a request made by SJB MP Harsha De Silva, Chairman of the Committee on Committee on Public Finance, he is yet to confirm his participation.

During an inquiry made by Ada Derana, the parliamentarian had stated that a decision pertaining to his attendance would be made following discussions within his party.
