US Federal Reserve cut rates 50pb, quantity tightening to continue

ECONOMYNEXT – The US Federal Reserve cut rates 50 basis points to target an overnight rate of 4.75/5.00 percent, with Chair Jerome Powell saying inflation and employment was balanced.

“Inflation is now much closer to our objective, and we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent,” Powell told reporters after the rate cut.

“As inflation has declined and the labor market has cooled, the upside risks to inflation have diminished and the downside risks to employment have increased.

“We now see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual mandate.”

The Fed’s ‘dual mandate’ is blamed for the current high inflation as well as the 1970s collapse of the Bretton Woods system and subsequent Great Inflation.

Following the collapse of the housing bubble, which was triggered by money printed to push inflation up, amid a productivity boom, US banks have been awash in excess liquidity (now called reserve balances), due to so-called quantitative easing.

The Fed will continue to reduce the liquidity at the rate of 25 billion dollars a month by reducing roll-overs of Treasury securities in its portfolio.

The Fed will provide up to a maximum of 500 billion dollars through overnight standing facilities and take excess cash deposits of up to 150 billion dollars from a market participant at a rate of 4.8 percent.
