HNB brings Christmas cheer with Annual Carol Service

Ringing in the Christmas season with joy and happiness, HNB PLC, recently hosted the annual carol service themed ‘O Come, All Ye Faithful’ at HNB Towers.

Rt. Rev. Dr. Valence Mendis, Bishop of Kandy diocese attended the festivities as the chief guest and was accompanied by HNB’s Chairman Nihal Jayawardana, Managing Director / CEO Damith Pallewatte, COO Sanjay Wijemanne, corporate and senior bank officials, staff / retired staff and families came together to enjoy the carols performed by the Hatna family choir.

Giving his Christmas message and blessings for the evening, Rt. Rev. Dr. Valence Mendis stressed In the First Book of the Bible, it is said twice that God created human beings in His own image, showing the dignity of human life. When we misused our freedom, we lost our initial dignity and hope, but God’s love did not give up on us—this is what Christmas is about. At the HNB carol service, the choir’s performance beautifully captured this message, reminding us of the enduring hope that God’s love brings this Christmas.

Meanwhile, HNB MD/CEO Damith Pallewatte in his message to the Hatna family, emphasized that improvement in the country can only take place with the commitment of all towards bringing about positive change.

Led by choirmaster Shanaka Senanayake, the HNB choristers presented a range of Christmas carols in English, Sinhala and Tamil, captivating the audience.
