Sri Lanka central bank issues directions on corporate governance

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank has issued directions on corporate governance of licensed commercial banks and specialized banks.

“These Directions were issued with a view to strengthening the corporate governance processes and practices of the licensed commercial banks and licensed specialised banks thus facilitating the conduct of banking business in a responsible and accountable manner in order to promote safety and soundness of the banking sector and the financial system as a whole,” the regulator said.

The directions cover the appointment of directors and the chairperson, the responsibilities of the board.

A chief executive who leaves one bank has to wait for a six-month cooling off period before working at another bank.
