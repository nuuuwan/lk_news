Fisheries Ministry Secretary K.N. Kumari Somarathna and Regen Renewables Managing Director and CEO Dr. Lakmal Fernado

In a significant step towards sustainable energy solutions, Regen Solar, specialists in the solar PV sector, has inaugurated a ground-breaking project.

The installation consisting of 1893 Nos. DAS Solar 570Wp solar panels is projected to yield 1,425 MWh of solar energy annually into the national grid.

The St. Jones Fish Market, once nestled in the bustling heart of Pettah before relocating to Peliyagoda in 2011, embodies a rich history. Established in 1894 by the Colombo Municipal Council along St. Johns Road, Pettah, it initially catered to residents but evolved into a wholesale trade hub over time. Today, the Peliyagoda Fish Market (PFM) boasts modern amenities, including 148 stalls for wholesale transactions, 20 stalls for retail operations, banking facilities, shops for fishing paraphernalia, a contemporary eatery, and two flake ice plants capable of producing 25 tons of ice daily.

The agreement, a milestone event, was formally endorsed by Fisheries Ministry Secretary K.N. Kumari Somarathna, and Regen Renewables Ltd., Managing Director and CEO Dr. Lakmal Fernado.

Regen Renewables, represents some of the globe’s premier brands within Sri Lanka. The panels installed at the CFM are from DAS Solar – world’s leading manufacturer of N-type solar modules and with Inverters from Sunways – another leading brand. Regen Solar with a track record of installing over 75 MW of systems and ongoing projects exceeding 10 MW, maintains a firm commitment to engineering excellence and product quality.

Both entities share a profound dedication towards sustainable development, envisioning a greener future for generations to come. This collaboration is poised to offset over 1,566,000kg of CO₂ emissions, marking the Colombo Fish Market Project as an environmentally conscious undertaking.

The entire project was proposed and lead by Fisheries and Aquatic Resources’ Minister Douglas Devananda and the ministry officials and financed and owned by Regen Renewables Ltd., on revenue sharing basis. This is the 8th such project financed and owned by Regen Renewables. With the pressing need for low-cost energy for businesses and energy wheeling being legalised Regen Solar is fast expanding its wingspan into similar market opportunities.
