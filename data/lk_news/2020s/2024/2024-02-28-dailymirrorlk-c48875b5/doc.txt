Colombo, Feb 28 (Daily Mirror) - Many members of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) will abandon their party and join President Ranil Wickremesinghe when he kicks off his campaign for presidency on March 10 this year, UNP General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara said today.

"These SJBers have already begun negotiations with us and will join us when our leader launches his campaign at a rally which is to be held in Kuliyapitiya on March 10," Range Bandara told a media briefing.
