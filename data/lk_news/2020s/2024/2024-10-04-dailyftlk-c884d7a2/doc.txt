Exim Bank of Korea to provide financial support for SL’s development projects

The Exim Bank of Korea has agreed to provide financial support for the development projects of the Government of Sri Lanka, the President’s Media Division said.

This agreement was announced during a meeting between officials of the Exim Bank of Korea and Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake.

PMD said following the collapse of Sri Lanka’s economy, financial support from the Korean Exim Bank for development projects was suspended from 2022 to 2024. However, during their meeting, representatives of the Exim Bank expressed their commitment to offering subsidised interest loans for the re-implementation of these projects.

They also emphasised their intention to support economically viable programs initiated by the Government of Sri Lanka in the future.

Exim Bank Director Won-suk HA, Deputy Director Hanui Han, Project Manager Nalin Jayathunga and Additional Secretary to the President Roshan Gamage were also present at the meeting.
