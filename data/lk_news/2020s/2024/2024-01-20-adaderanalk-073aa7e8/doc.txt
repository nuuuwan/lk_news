Family of lorry driver killed in Narammala shooting awarded Rs. 1mn

Sri Lanka Police have handed over Rs. 1 million in compensation to the family of the lorry driver who was killed in the shooting incident in Narammala.

Acting Inspector-General of Police (IGP) handed over the money to the bereaved at the deceased’s residence in Maharachchimulla, Alawwa.

The lorry driver was killed on Thursday night (Jan.18) after a police officer in civvies ‘accidentally’ discharged his firearm during a vehicle inspection. He was identified as a 41-year-old named Roshan Kumarathilake. He was a carpenter by profession.

The police media division said the driver had failed to comply with the signal to stop at a checkpoint in Dampelessa, Narammala.

A Sub-Inspector (SI) and a Constable had then chased down the lorry and pulled it over for a spot inspection. There, the SI had allegedly ‘accidentally’ discharged his firearm, critically wounding the driver, who was rushed to the Narammala District Hospital, but succumbed to injuries shortly after.

Meanwhile, a heated situation ensued in front of the Narammala police station following the shooting incident after the enraged family and relatives of the deceased and the area residents staged a protest.

The SI in question was subsequently arrested and remanded until January 23 on the orders of Narammala Magistrate’s Court. Additionally, both officers involved in the incident have been interdicted.
