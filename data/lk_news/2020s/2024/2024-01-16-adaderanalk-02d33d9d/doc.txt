Govt. to discuss concerns of health sector and find solutions

Acting Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe says that he is to meet Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana later this evening to discuss the concerns of the health sector and find solutions.

Around 72 trade unions in the health service excluding doctors have launched a 24-hour token strike from 6.30 a.m. today (16).

The trade unions are launching this action demanding that the allowance increase of Rs. 35,000 provided to the doctors be given to them as well while the health unions have also decided to carry out only essential duties.

However, it is said that this morning, Health Minister Ramesh Pathirana has also invited the striking trade unions to a discussion on the matter.
