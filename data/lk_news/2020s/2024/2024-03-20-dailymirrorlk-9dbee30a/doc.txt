PAFFREL warns of election delay via new electoral system

Colombo, March 20 (Daily Mirror) -  While raising concerns over the Cabinet nod to amend the existing electoral system in respect of the parliamentary election, People's Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL), alleged that the move could result in the postponement of the election.

Under the proposed amendments endorsed by the Cabinet, it is suggested that 160 Members of Parliament will be directly elected from the constituencies, while the remaining 65 seats will be allocated through a proportional voting system at either the national or provincial level.

Expressing its concerns, PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi told a press conference that Sri Lanka’s previous encounters with electoral system amendments had jeopardized the election process, resulting in delays.

“A case in point is the local government and provincial council elections, which were deferred for two years. As such, we have reservations that the proposed move to amend the electoral system could result in delaying the elections,” he noted.

Furthermore, Hettiarachchi emphasized the pivotal role of the delimitation process in any changes to the electoral system, drawing attention to past instances where election authorities had been compelled to put off elections due to delays in finalizing the delimitation process.

In light of these considerations, PAFFREL cautioned that the proposed amendments might trigger a delay in elections unless there is a consensus among political parties regarding the delimitation process.

“Failure to address this issue promptly could potentially hinder the electoral timeline as scheduled,” he added.
