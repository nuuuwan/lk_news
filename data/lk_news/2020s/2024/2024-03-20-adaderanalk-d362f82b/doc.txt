Wasantha Yapa Bandara joins parade of COPE resignations

MP Wasantha Yapa Bandara joined a parade of parliamentarians to quit the Committee of Public Enterprises (COPE) over the appointment of SLPP MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena as its chairman.

Shortly after the parliamentary session commenced this morning (March 20), the Deputy Speaker announced the appointment of Bandara as a COPE member.

However, the MP announced his resignation with immediate effect, asserting that he would communicate his decision in writing as well.

On March 07, Abeygunawardena was elected by majority votes to serve as the new chairman of COPE at the first committee meeting convened for the Fifth Session of the Ninth Parliament. His name had been nominated by MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage and was seconded by MP Sanjeewa Edirimanne.

Meanwhile, MPs Anura Dissanayaka, Rauff Hakeem, Dilan Perera, Dayasiri Jayasekara, Eran Wickramaratne, Nalin Bandara Jayamaha, S. M. Marikkar, Hesha Withanage, Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam, Gamini Waleboda, Prof. Charitha Herath were selected to serve in the COPE as its members.

However, as many as seven members – namely Wickramaratne, Waleboda, Herath, Jayasekara, Marikkar, Withanage and Rasamanickam – have thus far stepped down from the committee with Bandara becoming the 8th member to quit COPE.
