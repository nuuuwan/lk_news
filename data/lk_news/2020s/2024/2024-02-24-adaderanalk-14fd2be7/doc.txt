Sanath Nishantha’s death: Court says yet to receive postmortem report

The Welisara Magistrate’s Court says the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) has yet to submit the report on the postmortem of late State Minister Sanath Nishantha.

As such, Welisara Magistrate Thusitha Dhammika Uduwawidana has stated that the exact cause of death of the deceased lawmaker could not be announced under the circumstances.

This was communicated when Attorney-at-Law Dhanaraj Samarakoon, who appeared on behalf the late state minister’s wife, requested the court to reveal the exact cause of death of Sanath Nishantha, who died in a crash that took place on the Colombo - Katunayake expressway on January 25.

The magistrate, directing the Kandana police officers to inform the JMO to submit the postmortem report to the court, subsequently fixed the complaint to be taken up again on July 01.

Attorney-at-Law Chamari Priyanka, the wife of the late state minister previously raised suspicions surrounding the lawmaker’s death, claiming that certain factors pertaining to the accident remain suspicious, and had thereby requested for an investigation into the incident.
