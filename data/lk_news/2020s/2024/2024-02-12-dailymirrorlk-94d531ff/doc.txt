NPP trying to become the main opposition: SJB MP

Colombo, Feb. 12 (Daily Mirror)- National People's Power (NPP) was trying to become the main opposition in the country, Samagi Jana Balawegaya Spokesman and Member of Parliament S. M. Marikar said today.

“What we can gather from the recent visit of NPP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake to India is that his party is trying to become the main opposition in the country,” Marikar told a news briefing.

“We don’t mind NPP becoming the main opposition as we will be in the government when they become the main opposition of this country” he added.

“Anyway, we feel that Dissanayake’s visit to India is a positive move. He must have come back after learning lessons on investments and foreign relations,” the MP also said.
