Rathupaswala shooting: High Court to deliver verdict today

The verdict in the case against a Brigadier and three soldiers of the Sri Lanka Army, over the shooting to death of three persons and injuring 45 others during a protest by villagers demanding clean drinking water at Rathupaswala, Gampaha is scheduled to be delivered today (17) by a special three-member high court bench.

On April 30, 2024, the Gampaha High Court’s Trial-at-Bar deferred delivering the verdict in the case until today (May 17).

On August 01, 2013, army personnel opened fire at unarmed villagers at Weliweriya, killing three and injuring several others, as they protested against a factory which they said polluted their groundwater and demanded clean drinking water.

In 2019, then Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya appointed a Trial-at-Bar consisting of High Court Judges Menaka Wijesundara (President), Nimal Ranaweera and Nishantha Hapuarachchi to hear the Rathupaswala case, after considering the Attorney General’s request.
