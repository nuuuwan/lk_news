Sri Lanka President discusses future cooperation with top USAID official

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka President Anura Kumara Dissanayake held a virtual discussion with the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Samantha Power on future cooperation, the President’s Media Division said.

It is the first meeting between Power and Dissanayake since the Presidential elections on September 21.

“During the meeting, the two leaders exchanged views on matters of mutual interest and explored avenues for future cooperation,” the PMD said in a statement.

Power stated that USAID is willing to support the government aligning with the manifesto presented to the people; the PMD said referring to Dissanayake’s policy framework focused on strong anti-corruption actions.

“Samantha Power also assured President Dissanayake that USAID is prepared to support Sri Lanka in any way needed. This commitment reflects a shared vision for enhancing development and cooperation with the USAID agency,” PMD said.
