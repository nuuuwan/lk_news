Volkswagen Club celebrates 21st ’Pride of Ownership’ drive

Colombo, April 19 (Daily Mirror) - The Volkswagen (VW) Beetle Owners’ Club has arranged to hold the annual 'Pride of Ownership' drive after a break of five years, on April 28.

It is with great pleasure that the club notes the traditional partners of the 'Pride of Ownership' drive who have come together, namely the Hilton Colombo and the Browns Hotel Management Services, along with the LOLC Group of Companies, who have so graciously supported the event to bring back the past glory of “Pride” and the traditional “Start” from The Hilton Colombo.

Members and their guests will be welcome to the Sports Centre of the Hilton to be greeted with the usual fanfare, and the drive will proceed along Galle Road to the luxurious Thaala Resort situated in Bentota.

As on all our previous 'Pride of Ownership' drives, the club expects over one hundred Beetles, the famous Combi Vans, Variants, Karman Ghias and other Volkswagen models to participate at this year’s event, not missing out on the subsidised facilities that have been offered for the event, along with a valuable Club Give-Away that would be gifted to the participants.

Members are kindly requested not to miss this “Grand Event,” and all owners of VW’s are warmly welcome to participate at the 'Pride of Ownership' Drive.

Participants can contact Jaliya Jayasuriya of the club on 077 629 4761 to confirm their participation.

This is an event not to be missed, and the club looks forward to the long-standing participation and a successful 'Pride of Ownership' drive.
