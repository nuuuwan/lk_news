Finance Ministry to offer financial support for MSMEs facing hardships

The Ministry of Finance, in a bid to re-energize the Micro, Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (MSMEs) facing hardships, will offer financial support through a re-energizing package for investment and working capital, the Presidentâ€™s Media Division (PMD) said.

Accordingly, loans are available at affordable rates of 8% for working capital and 7% for investment via 15 participatory financial institutions, including licensed commercial and specialized banks, to support MSMEs that survived the crisis and those in the non-performing loans category, it added.
