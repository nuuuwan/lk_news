Hayleys Solar achieves 200MWp rooftop solar PV capacity

Hayleys Solar announced a significant milestone of achieving a staggering 200MWp rooftop solar PV capacity in Sri Lanka. This remarkable accomplishment stands as the largest of its kind carried out by a single entity in the nation, marking a momentous stride towards driving the country’s progress with sustainable and clean renewable energy solutions.

Surpassing the 200MWp mark, Hayleys Solar has not only set a record but has also contributed immensely towards the country’s total installed solar capacity, which currently stands at 900MWp. The 200MWp of solar capacity installed by Hayleys Solar is estimated to save an impressive 202,446,520 kg of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions annually, underlining the company’s commitment to environmental sustainability.

In celebration of this tremendous feat, Hayleys Solar is embarking on a groundbreaking CSR initiative titled “Soorya Sathkara,”- an innovative Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative aimed at “Bringing Light & Transforming Lives” across Sri Lanka. Under the leadership of Mohan Pandithage, Chairman and Chief Executive of Hayleys PLC, “Soorya Sathkara” sets out to illuminate the lives of residents in 200 Children’s Homes, Elderly Homes, and Special Needs Care Centers spanning the length and breadth of the island.
