The new alliance led by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will be launched next week, says former President Maithripala Sirisena.

Meanwhile, SLFP’s General Secretary Dushmantha Mithrapala said as amendments to the Constitution of Podujana Eksath Peramuna (United People’s Front) have already been made, new office bearers will soon be appointed.
