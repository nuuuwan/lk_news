Civil offenders to be sentenced to house-arrest to control prison overcrowding?

Measures are afoot to sentence those found guilty of civil offences to house-arrest, in a bid to control the rate of overcrowding in the country’s prisons, State Minister of Justice and Prison Affairs Anuradha Jayaratne said.

Accordingly, the State Minister revealed that steps have been taken to draft the relevant laws in this regard, adding that the Legal Draftsman’s Department is already working in this regard, following which the draft is slated to be presented in Parliament later this year.

State Minister Jayaratne further added that parallel to these measures, several Acts, including the Bail Act will have to be amended.
