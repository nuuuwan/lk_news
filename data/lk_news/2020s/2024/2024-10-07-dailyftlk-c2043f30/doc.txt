“We acknowledge the contributions of the Government, Governor of the Central Bank, the Secretary to the Treasury, and all relevant stakeholders who played an essential role in this achievement. The steadfast commitment to aligning with the Comparability of Treatment (CoT) principle has been crucial in advancing Sri Lanka’s broader economic reform agenda. We are appreciative of the quick response of the OCC countries and the IMF in this regard,” The Ceylon Chamber said in a statement.

The Chamber said it looks forward to the completion of the restructuring of Sri Lanka’s external debt. The completion of the OCC and IMF consultation process is a positive indicator for ensuring successful future reviews and disbursements under the IMF’s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement, which will be essential in the country’s journey towards fiscal stability and economic transformation.
