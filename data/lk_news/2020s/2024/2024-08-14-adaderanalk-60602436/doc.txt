Special announcement from Commissioner General of Elections

The Commissioner General of Elections, Saman Sri Ratnayake, has stated that persons with disabilities can use the temporary ID card issued to them when voting in the upcoming presidential election.

He made these remarks while speaking to the media today (14).

The 2024 presidential election is scheduled to be held on September 21.

When asked what document must be produced to verify the identity of voters, he responded:

“A valid national identity card, a valid driver’s license, or a valid passport; an elderly identity card issued by the Department of Social Services; or a pensioner’s identity card issued by the Department of Pensions. Additionally, the identity card issued by the Department of Registration of Persons to Reverend Priests is acceptable. For those who do not have any of these, they can go to the election office with their Grama Niladhari officers and obtain a temporary ID card.

“This time, it was specifically mentioned that we have issued a temporary ID card for the disabled community, and they have the ability to use that temporary ID card,” said the Commissioner General of Elections.
