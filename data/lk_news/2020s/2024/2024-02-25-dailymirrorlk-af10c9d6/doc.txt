SriLankan flights delayed as airport ground staff protest

BIA, Feb 25 (Daily Mirror) - At least four SriLankan flights were delayed at Bandaranaike International Airport this morning due to ground staff refraining from performing some of their duties.

The ground staff reportedly ceased their duties at 4:30 AM but resumed after two and a half hours following a call from authorities for a discussion.

The protest was allegedly initiated by airport workers demanding immediate solutions to inefficiencies within SriLankan Airlines.
