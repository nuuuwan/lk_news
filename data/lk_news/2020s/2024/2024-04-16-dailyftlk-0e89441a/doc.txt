India lifts export ban on onions for Sri Lanka

In a gesture reaffirming Indiaâ€™s commitment to its Neighbourhood First policy, the Government of India has announced the lifting of the export ban on onions for Sri Lanka.

Under the new directive issued by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade, Sri Lanka is now permitted to import up to 10,000 tons of onions from India.

The decision to exempt Sri Lanka from the export ban on onions underscores the close bilateral ties between the two countries and comes as a timely move ahead of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year festivities in Sri Lanka.
