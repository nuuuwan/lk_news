Keheliya at CID over immunoglobulin scandal

COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lanka's Former Health Minister Rambukwella arrived at the Criminal Investigations Department in Colombo on Friday (2) morning, complying with a Court Order issued a day earlier.

He is expected to provide a statement to the CID with regard to the controversial human immunoglobulin procurement.

Maligakanda Magistrate Lochana Abeywickrama ordered Minister Keheliya Rambukwella to report to the Criminal Investigations Department in Colombo at Â 9 AM on Friday (2) to provide a statement.

The order was made upon considering the submissions that were made by Deputy Solicitor General Lakmini Girihagama on behalf of the Attorney General when the case filed over the controversial human immunoglobulin procurement was taken up in court.

The Deputy Solicitor General also told the court that one of the reasons provided by Keheliya Rambukwella for failing to make a scheduled appearance at the CID on Wednesday (31), is also false.

She told the court that the Secretary to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Public Expenditure Management had confirmed in writing that Keheliya Rambukwella did not attend the meeting at the President's Office on Wednesday (31).

Taking these facts into consideration, the Maligakanda Magistrate imposed an overseas travel ban on the Minister, and ordered him to report to the CID at 9 AM on Friday (2) to provide a statement.
