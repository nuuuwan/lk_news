President challenges Sajith and Anura to an open discussion

President Ranil Wickremesinghe has challenged Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake to participate in an open virtual discussion with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

This will allow the entire nation to assess the truthfulness of their public promises and statements, he said.

The President also highlighted that altering the agreement with the IMF is not feasible. He emphasized that such changes could lead to another economic collapse, with Premadasa and Dissanayake’s “misleading promises” of reduced prices and taxes potentially worsening the country’s situation. He stressed the need to prevent such deceptions.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe noted that while he wishes to reduce the prices of goods and lower taxes, such actions can only be achieved by strengthening the rupee and adhering to the agreements with the IMF.

He also urged Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake to immediately present any alternative solutions and seek their opinion during the discussion with the IMF.

The President made these remarks during the Special Convention of the United National Party (UNP), held yesterday (25) at the Party Headquarters ‘Sirikotha’, Pitakotte.

Recalling on D.S. Senanayake, the founder of the UNP, President Wickremesinghe said that he was dedicated to preserving Sri Lankan identity. President Wickremesinghe, following the example of Dudley Senanayake, J.R. Jayawardene and Ranasinghe Premadasa, stated that his inspiration from working with these legends is to prioritize the country’s welfare above all else.

A large number of UNP members attended the special convention, expressing their support for President Ranil Wickremesinghe. They endorsed his candidacy as an independent for the upcoming Presidential Election on September 21, with the aim of advancing Sri Lanka toward development. The proposal to express the party’s agreement was presented to the conference by UNP General Secretary, Palitha Range Bandara.

The UNP National Organizer Sagala Ratnayaka confirmed the resolution; it was passed unanimously with all attendees raising their hands in agreement.

Additionally, the President inaugurated the newly renovated Sirikotha party headquarters.
