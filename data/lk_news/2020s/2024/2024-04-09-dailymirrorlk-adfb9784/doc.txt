SLA target four events at Paris Olympic Games

Apr. 9 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka Athletic (SLA) is optimistic they will qualify to participate in at least four events at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, SLA President Major General Palitha Fernando (Retired) said.

The deadline set by the IAAF to reach the Paris Olympic Games track and field events is June 30.

The qualifying period for the Paris Olympic Games athletics events is from June 30 2023 to June 30 2024, but none of the Sri Lankan athletes have reached the required standards.

A 36-member elite athletic pool set up by the SLA is currently training while targeting the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.

The SLA is hopeful that elite athletes including Birmingham Commonwealth Games Bronze Medallist Yupun Abeykoon (100m Men), Hangzhou Asian Games Gold Medallist Tharushi Karunarathna (800m Women), Hangzhou Asian Games Silver Medallist Dilhani Lekamge (javelin throw Women) and the Hangzhou Bronze Medallist 4X400m Men’s Relay Team will be able to improve their performances in the upcoming international athletic events.

Meanwhile, the IAAF World Athletic Relay Championships, which will be held from May 4 to 5 at the Thomas Robinson Stadium in Nassau Bahamas, will be the final Olympics Qualifying Relay event.

The Sri Lanka 4X400m Men’s Relay Team will include Kalinga Kumarage, Aruna Dharshana, Rajitha Rajakaruna, Dinuka Deshan and Pasindu Kodikara.
