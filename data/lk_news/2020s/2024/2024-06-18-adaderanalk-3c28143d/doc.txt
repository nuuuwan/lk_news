Water supply to several areas restored as damaged pipeline repaired

The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWS&DB) has announced that the water supply to Godagama, Homagama, Pannipitiya, Pelanwatta, Rukmalgama, and Mattegoda areas has been restored today (18).

The water supply in these areas was interrupted due to damage to the transmission pipeline from the Kalatuwawa Treatment Plant.

The NWS&DB states that due to this, the water supply to a number of areas in the Colombo District was disrupted and as the damaged pipeline has been repaired, the water supply was restored by around 2.00 a.m. today (18).

Accordingly, the water board said that water supply to some remote areas will be restored in the next few hours.

The disruption followed a car accident on Monday morning, which caused the vehicle to veer off the road and collide with the pipeline near Godagama, close to the High-Level Road.

As a result of the incident, the water supply to over 100,000 housing units in the affected areas was interrupted.
