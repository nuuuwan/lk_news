Parliament up in arms against salary hike for Central Bank employees

Members of both the Government and the Opposition are up in arms against the recent salary hike granted to the employees of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL).

The latest attack came from Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva who said Parliament should be given the right to decide on the salary increments of the CBSL officials.

"Parliament should approve any salary hikes for Central Bank officials as it is the legislature that has the power over finances. Let us bring in such a law," he said.

"Do office assistants of the Central Bank perform any special role to become entitled to an exorbitant salary," he asked in response to the salary hike given to Central Bank office assistants.

Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella also criticised the salary hike.

"The monthly salary of a Deputy Governor of the Central Bank has been increased to Rs. 1.6 million while a peon's salary has been increased by Rs. 70,000," he said.
