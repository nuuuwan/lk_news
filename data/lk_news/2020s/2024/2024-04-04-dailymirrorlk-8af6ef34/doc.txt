Sustainability neglect may stunt tourism growth in  Sri Lanka: Intrepid Travel Chief

A global leader in responsible tourism raised concerns on lack of focus on sustainability in the tourism sector, which in turn could impede the current growth momentum in the medium term.

Intrepid Travel Chairman and Co-Founder Darrell Wade, who was recently in Sri Lanka, said the current status of the tourism industry, in terms of sustainability, is worrisome, primarily because of the drive for growth.

“We understand that it’s good for the economy, jobs, balance of payments, all sort of things. But if the growth is too fast and doesn’t factor sustainability, then that’s a major problem. We haven’t seen enough attention on sustainability (in Sri Lanka),” Wade told Mirror Business during his recent visit to Sri Lanka.

Although Sri Lanka may sustain the current growth momentum for the next two to three years, he expressed concern that it would not be sustainable beyond four to six years, if sustainability is not factored into the tourism strategy now.

He stressed that the industry stakeholders, along with the government authorities, must come together to develop guidelines on sustainability, instead of

“You need collective attention to work towards guidelines that could steer the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority or whoever is in charge to say that we need to oblige with the rules being laid on sustainability,” he added.

In particular, he noted that such a mechanism is essential to make material progress.

Intrepid plans to foster greater economic growth in Sri Lanka, supporting a vibrant tourism industry and engaging local community philanthropy under its 2030 strategy.

It plans to bring over 15,000 travellers to Sri Lanka by 2030, a boost to responsible tourism, up from 4500 travellers ensilaged for this year.

“... we are very happy to take a leadership role on sustainability and we do it everywhere in the world,” Wade added.
