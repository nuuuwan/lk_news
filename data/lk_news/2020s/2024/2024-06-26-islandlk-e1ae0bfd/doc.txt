All those deaths in vain!

After 1948, which saw the end of the 443 years of colonial rule, which started with the Portuguese rule over the maritime provinces from 1505 to1658, followed by the Dutch, who also ruled over the maritime provinces from 1658-1796 and the British, who were able to take over the entire country in 1815, thanks to treachery of some chieftains, the biggest threat to Sri Lanka’s independence came from India in 1987. President J R Jayewardene, who signed ‘the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord’ in Colombo on 29 July 1987 with the then Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, stated that he had been forced to sign it as India threatened to invade Sri Lanka, if he refused to comply. It is a great shame that a man who won the mandate of five sixths of the electorate did not have the guts to stand up to India.

The Indian Peace Keeping Force, Rajiv sent, failed. In a sinister move, R Premadasa, who succeeded JR in 1989, funded and armed the Tigers to fight IPKF. Ultimately, Tigers assassinated both Rajiv and Premadasa! Although India did not honour the agreement, the 13th Amendment (13A) was imposed on Sri Lanka. When the Tigers were comprehensively defeated, militarily, a priority should have been the abrogation of 13A, as it left it open for a Muslim militancy to follow, as the joining of the Eastern province with the Northern would have made Muslims in the East, a minority in the merged province. A golden opportunity was lost in finding a way forward for true reconciliation with the concurrence of all.

The scenario was set for the second uprising by the JVP, on top of the continuing war with the Tigers, and the JVP website states the following in the section titled “A Brief History of the JVP (Peoples Liberation Front) Sri Lanka”:

“India was unhappy with the President Jayewardene’s pro-US foreign policy. India provided material and moral support to the Tamil Separatist organisations, ignoring its long-term strategic interests. More than 100,000 Tamils in the North of Sri Lanka fled to India. India has been burdened with Sri Lankan refugee crisis since then. The crisis created by the National Question of Sri Lanka finally led to the direct interference of India into internal affairs of Sri Lanka.

“The JVP took every attempt to convince India, our friendly and the closest neighbour for centuries, not to get involved in the political mess in Sri Lanka. The JVP was not successful in convincing India, and as a result had to oppose India, the pro-US Sri Lankan government, and the separatists who fight to dismember Sri Lanka and create an ethnically cleansed entity called Tamil Ealam that will destroy the hitherto enjoyed unity of the people. In 1987 July the then President of Sri Lanka, J R Jayawardene of the UNP, was compelled by India to sign the Jayewardene – Rajiv Gandhi accord or the Indo-Lanka accord that allowed the Indian Army to enter Sri Lankan waters and land. The JVP then had only one option to prevent the abdication of sovereignty and the division of Sri Lanka. The JVP took the correct decision to launch an armed struggle to defeat all enemies of Sri Lanka. The majority of people of Sri Lanka supported the patriotic struggle until it was crushed by the UNP regime who engaged paramilitary groups and state sponsored killer squads to kill more than 60,000 people. Most of the members of the Central Committee, and all but one member of the political bureau of the JVP, were arrested and killed while they were in custody.

In spite of investigations by two presidential commissions, the numbers killed during the second JVP uprising is undetermined. Perhaps, the above reference to 60,000 may well be the number of JVP cadres killed. Some estimates put the numbers killed by the JVP as low as 6,000 but most them were innocent by all standards except those of the JVP. Brutality, on both sides, was reprehensible.

Although the JVP has admitted in its website that mistakes were made during the first uprising, no such admission is made regarding the second uprising. One of its prominent members, Nalin Hewage, in response to an allegation by a panel member during a TV interview that the JVP had killed his father during its second insurrection in the eighties, shot back claiming that anti-social elements such as rapists, robbers, bootleggers and cattle rustlers had been killed during those dark days!

Even more astonishing is the assurance given by the leader of the JVP, when he visited the North, that once elected, his government would go beyond 13A. Either he is suffering from total amnesia and has forgotten the second JVP uprising, which resulted in the loss of over 60,000 lives or he is a hypocrite of the highest order! Ranil Wickremesinghe, who under the guidance of shady characters like Erik Solheim, signed secret deals with Tigers, may be able to secure the Tamil vote, if he decides to contest, as the TNA, which was under the thumb of Tigers is likely to support him. Sajith, who seems to have forgotten that his father, President Ranasinghe Premadasa, in spite of some of the good he did, was not a popular leader at the time of assassination, has promised the full implementation of 13A!

‘The Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord’ resulted only in 13A and over 60, 000 deaths, the blame for which should be apportioned on the UNP and the JVP. Now that a presidential election is around the corner, the son of the president and successor of the JVP have made about-turns on 13A for expedience! Were not all those deaths in vain?
