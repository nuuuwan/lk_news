Sri Lanka railway workers on strike informed they have vacated post

ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka’s railway employees who are currently on strike have all been sent letters informing that they are considered to have vacated their posts, Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardena said.

Gunawardena told reporters Thursday July 11 afternoon that the General Manger of Railways has sent letters to all station masters who are on strike, on the grounds that they have broken the law.

“A young man died during the previous strike. This time, because of the strikes that were suddenly organised as a sabotage campaign, a passenger died. The strikers have claimed two lives.

The minister said that the station masters who continue to be on strike despite President Ranil Wickremesinghe declaring public transport an essential service.

“These acts of sabotage are a burden to hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens. I knew of this in advance, so I wrote a letter to the president requesting that public transport be declared an essential service. Despite a gazette being been issued declaring this, these union terrorists have challenged the country’s law and the executive president’s orders,” said Gunawardena.

“On the grounds that they have not followed the law, the General Manager has sent out letters informing all station masters on strike that they have vacated their post,” he said. (Colombo/Jul11/2024)
