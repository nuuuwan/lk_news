US Embassy, WhimsicalWits launch Cyber Hero app to promote digital safety in Sri Lanka

ECONOMYNEXT – The US Embassy in Sri Lanka and WhimsicalWits has launched a mobile app to educate and empower youth and marginalized communities on digital safety and responsible online behavior.

The Cyber Hero app was developed by a female-led team at WhimsicalWits to promote cybersecurity and digital literacy.

It teaches users how to recognize and respond to cyber threats, such as phishing, malware, and privacy breaches, making it an effective resource for building digital resilience among young people and communities.

“Cybersecurity isn’t just a global issue; it’s personal and local,” US Ambassador Julie Chung said at the launch event held at the American Center in Colombo, where Chung and Uthpala Pathirana, Managing Director of WhimsicalWits demonstrated the app.

The app, which is available for free on the Google Play Store, is designed to immerse players in real-world online safety scenarios.

“We are thrilled to see how Cyber Hero will contribute to a smarter, safer digital world. By offering this tool for free, we are not only providing immediate education but also fostering a culture of digital responsibility and safety that will benefit individuals, families, and communities for years to come.”

Developed as part of the Protecting Online Rights of Changemakers (PORCH) project, supported by Internews and funded by the US Embassy, Cyber Hero is a key educational tool.

The game uses an immersive, gamified experience to make complex digital rights concepts accessible and engaging for players, helping them navigate the online world with confidence.

The game is a collaborative effort involving key partners across South Asia, with WhimsicalWits Studio leading the design and development of the 3D game.

The script for Cyber Hero was developed by Digitally Right, Bangladesh, who brought their expertise in crafting educational digital content to ensure the game’s narrative resonates with young players. (Colombo/Oct29/2024)
