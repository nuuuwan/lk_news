Sri Lanka stocks close up after days of dropping

ECONOMYNEXT – The Colombo Stock Exchange closed up on Wednesday, data on its site showed.

The broader All Share Index closed up 0.03 percent, or 3.59 points, at 10,574; while the more liquid S&P SL20 Index closed up 0.02 percent, or 0.47 points, at 2,923.

“We saw the  market close down consecutively due to the political uncertainty, so this could be somewhat of a correction,” Softlogic Stockbrokers said. “There was also speculation that the tables are going to turn.”

“But overall the stance is the same. Institutions and funds have taken positions to be in cash.”

Top contributors to the ASPI were Royal Ceramics (up at 29.40), National Development Bank (up at 63.10), Asian Hotels and Properties (up at 54.50), SMB Finance (up at 0.60), and Industrial Asphalts (up at 0.30).
