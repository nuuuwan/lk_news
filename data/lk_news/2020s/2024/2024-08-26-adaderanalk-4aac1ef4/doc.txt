Employment opportunities for Sri Lankan women in South Korea’s fisheries sector

Sri Lankan females have also now been provided with the opportunity to seek employment in South Korea’s fisheries sector, according to the SLBFE.

The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) announced that 120 individuals including three females departed for South Korea yesterday (25) to take up these employment opportunities in the fisheries sector in that country.

This was made possible through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) entered into between the South Korean and Sri Lankan governments.

The program is being implemented by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE).
