Vote on Account to be presented for 2025 instead of Budget â€“ state minister

State Minister of Finance, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya says that a new budget will likely not be presented for the fiscal year 2025, and instead a Vote on Account will be presented for the expenses in the first few months of next year.

Accordingly, it is reported that the Vote on Account will be implemented until the end of March 2025.

According to the election calendar, this year is an election year and it is reported that a national election will be held at the end of the year

Therefore, a new budget will not be presented at the end of this year for the fiscal year 2025, thereby allowing the new government elected in the election to unveil its policy statement, state minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya further said.
