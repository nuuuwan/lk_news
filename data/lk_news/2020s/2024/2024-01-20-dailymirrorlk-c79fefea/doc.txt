Murky reasons for milk production drop in Sri Lanka

Parliament, Jan. 20 (Daily Mirror)-  Sri Lanka’s dairy industry is facing a major crisis, with around 14,000 small-scale farms shutting down and milk production declining sharply as revealed yesterday by the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) in Parliament.

While officials from the State Ministry of Livestock Department blamed the closures on animal theft, the MPS expressed skepticism.

They argued that other factors, such as the destruction of grasslands and land-related issues, likely played a more significant role.

The COPA emphasized the need for the Department of Animal Production and Health to maintain accurate and clear data on the industry.this data is crucial for understanding the root causes of the crisis and formulating effective policy responses.

Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera, who also attended the meeting, acknowledged the decline in milk production received by Milco, the country’s largest dairy processor. He stressed the importance of implementing the Artificial Insemination Programme and formulating a National Policy on milk production to address the challenges facing the industry.

The death of 104 Australian goats imported for breeding raised concerns about animal care practices. COPA members urged the department to ensure proper care and management of imported livestock to prevent similar incidents in the future.
