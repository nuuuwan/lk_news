Highlighting a remarkable increase of over 50% in government income in 2023 compared to 2022, President Wickremesinghe underscored the conducive backdrop for advancing confidently with a robust economy. These remarks were made during his attendance at the inauguration of the International Gem and Jewellery Trade Centre, known as the Ratnapura Gem Tower, this morning (04).

Financing for this venture is sourced from the National Gems and Jewellery Authority, aiming to establish an international hub facilitating seamless transactions between sellers and buyers.

Functioning akin to renowned sales centres in Bangkok and Hong Kong, the centre will offer comprehensive services including independent quality testing, laboratory facilities, and banking and export services. This initiative aims to bolster the gem and jewellery trade, positioning Ratnapura as a pivotal player in the global market.

During his visit to the International Gems and Jewellery Trade Centre, President Ranil Wickremesinghe not only unveiled the plaque to mark its inauguration but also conducted an inspection tour of the facilities.

He underscored the industry’s resilience and its contribution as a cornerstone for economic recovery efforts.

“Following recent discussions with relevant ministries regarding challenges stemming from increased taxes in the gem and gold sectors, I have instructed officials to explore potential reliefs and submit a report by the end of this April,” President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated. “Additionally, we are aiming to generate at least USD 02 billion in revenue from this field in the future, with a particular emphasis on ensuring benefits for gem miners during the sector’s development.”

In reflecting on the country’s economic trajectory over the past two years, President Wickremesinghe acknowledged the difficult journey, which necessitated tough decisions, including tax hikes. Nonetheless, he underscored the positive outcomes achieved to date, instilling confidence for the future.

Highlighting a significant transformation in the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth, President Wickremesinghe noted a shift from a decline of minus 7.4 in July 2022 to a positive 4.5 in 2024. This marked improvement over two years underscores the resilience and perseverance of the population, who endured hardships and contributed to the nation’s economic advancement.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe provided insightful data on the country’s economic progress. He noted that in July 2022, inflation stood at a staggering 54.6%, but today it has significantly reduced to 0.9%. This control over inflation has contributed to the strengthening of the Sri Lankan Rupee. Additionally, bank interest rates have decreased from 23.8% to 10.3%, with expectations for further reduction in the coming months as stated by the Governor of the Central Bank.

President Wickremesinghe highlighted the improvement in the foreign exchange rate, which has decreased from Rs. 361.80 per dollar in the past to Rs. 300.40 presently. Efforts are underway to further lower this rate to Rs. 280, aiming to bolster the strength of the rupee.

In terms of government finances, President Wickremesinghe emphasized a significant increase of over 50% in government income in 2023 compared to 2022. Furthermore, expenditure for social services has tripled, reflecting the government’s commitment to enhancing social welfare.

Regarding debt restructuring, President Wickremesinghe noted the completion of discussions on domestic debt and highlighted the on-going negotiations with creditor countries.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe outlined ambitious targets for reducing government debt as a percentage of GDP, aiming to bring it down from the current 128% to 95% by 2032. He emphasized the necessity of achieving a cash income of 35% of GDP, which needs to be reduced to 13% by 2032. Additionally, the goal is to transform foreign loans, which currently stand at 9.4% of GDP, into a surplus of 2.3% by 2025.

President Wickremesinghe stressed the importance of adhering to these targets to avoid repercussions such as demands for loan repayment from creditor countries.

Highlighting recent positive developments, President Wickremesinghe mentioned a successful harvest during the Maha season and efforts to increase salaries for government employees during this New Year season.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe highlighted the stark contrast between the challenging conditions of the past and the current improved situation. He pointed out the scarcity of fuel for three-wheelers and electricity shortages in previous times, contrasting it with the present abundance of fuel and availability of electricity. President Wickremesinghe noted that the income of three-wheeler drivers has also increased, attributed to the influx of both domestic and foreign tourists. He emphasized the significance of these improvements by highlighting the three-wheeler drivers’ involvement in political activities, while displaying posters, which would not have been feasible without the economic progress achieved in the last two years.

President Wickremesinghe stressed the importance of safeguarding the current economic gains and moving forward. He cautioned against the risk of regression, emphasizing that the country still teeters on the edge economically. He called for a decisive choice between either falling back into past hardships or continuing to advance from the current position.

He highlighted the proactive approach taken by local leaders in addressing the challenges faced by gem traders, with the President offering directives for prompt resolutions.

Comparing Sri Lanka’s gem trade performance to that of Hong Kong and Thailand, Dr. Pathirana underscored the immense potential for revenue generation. Despite Sri Lanka’s abundant gem resources, its income in this sector remains comparatively low. Dr. Pathirana advocated for the timely promotion of free trade, akin to the successful models in Thailand and Hong Kong, expressing confidence in the endorsement of such economic initiatives by the President.

Minister of Wildlife, Forest Resources Conservation and Irrigation Mrs. Pavithradevi Wanniarachchi, hailed the inauguration of the International Gem Trade Centre in Ratnapura as a significant boon for the nation’s economy.

State Minister Dasanayake underscored that the centre is fully equipped with facilities essential for the gem business.

In response to media reports discussing economic development, State Minister criticized political leaders who had not stepped forward to address the economic crisis in 2022, yet now seek to engage in debates regarding the country’s economic progress. He questioned the credibility of individuals who failed to develop the housing development authority in spearheading the nation’s economic development efforts.

Mr. Seneviratne emphasized the importance of this international centre in facilitating the sale of Sri Lankan gems at fair prices globally, which in turn would contribute to the economic recovery of the country. He noted that the conception of this centre dates back to 2012, and its completion despite numerous challenges represents a victory for both the business community and the nation as a whole.
