AG clears draft Bill to amend Mediation Board Act

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the publication of the draft Bill to amend the Mediation Board Act in the Government gazette and table it in Parliament for approval.

The move follows Attorney Generalâ€™s clearance to the revised Bill prepared by the Legal Draftsman.

On 25 September 2023, the Cabinet of Ministers granted approval to amend Section 7 of the Mediation Board Act No. 72 of 1988 to address issues related to court appearances when mediation is not mutually agreed upon by both parties.

The amendment also aims to tackle administrative problems, such as delays in issuing non-clearance certificates by mediation boards and the non-existence of operational mediation boards.

The proposal to this effect submitted by the Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
