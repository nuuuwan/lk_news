Will defy all laws and begin another Aragalaya tomorrow: SJB

Colombo, Jan 29 (Daily Mirror) -  The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) will not take notice of any restrictions but will take to the streets tomorrow and fire the first shot towards overthrowing the present government, SJB General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara said today.

“The IGP or anyone else can impose any restriction but we will defy all laws and bring 50,000 people to Colombo tomorrow,” Madduma Bandara told a media briefing.

“It was the SJB which pioneered the uprising in 2022 and we intend to do the same this time as well,” Madduma Banadara added.

“We will not disclose where we will march towards now, but we will reveal it at the correct time tomorrow,” he added.

Former MP Hirunika Premachandra who also participated in the briefing said the protest will be against suppressive legislations such as the Anti-Terrorism Bill, Online Safety Bill and increased taxes.

“We will disclose where we are going  to surround at the right time,” she also said
