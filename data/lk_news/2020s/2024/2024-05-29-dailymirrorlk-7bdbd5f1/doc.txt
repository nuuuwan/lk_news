Ranil will never go for referendum: AKD

Colombo, May 29 (Daily Mirror)- President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who cannot win the presidential election will never go for a referendum, National People’s Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today.

He told the media in Colombo that if Ranil Wickremesinghe could win the referendum, he would definitely go for the presidential election.

Dissanayake said they are trying to create confusion in the society as Ranil Wickremesinghe and Basil Rajapaksa have no plans or vision for the election.

"The other political groups are already engaged in election campaigns. Ranil Wickremesinghe and Basil Rajapaksa have no plans or vision for the election. So, they want to create confusion in society. They created news that Parliament will be dissolved. UNP MP Vajira Abeywardane said once that Ranil should be given ten years,” he said.

He said it is not good to insult the Constitution and people's mandate and create confusion in the society for their cheap political ends.
