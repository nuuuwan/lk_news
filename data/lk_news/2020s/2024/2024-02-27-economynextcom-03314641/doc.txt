Sri Lanka to seek private investments in water sector

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is looking to form public private partnerships in the water sector, specifically to focus on rural water supply, Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Jeevan Thondaman has said.

“Not privatization, but public private partnerships,” Thondaman said at a press briefing on Monday. “When we enhance private sector participation, we create a more competitive industry with better quality and cheaper prices.”

A water tariff formula, which will be reviewed annually or bi-annually, has been formulated and will be submitted to the cabinet, parliament and COPE committee, he said.

“Once this is in place, we will be able to attract investors to come on board. The water sector till now has not had a PPP model. We want to bring in private public sector partnerships in rural communities’ water supply; we believe they will be able to work hand in hand with community-based organizations to provide water to those who need it.

“I can give you one example, when you look at the water bottle that is being manufactured by the Water Board, you will see it’s from the Hanthana Estate; but people in Hanthana Estate still don’t have drinking water. There has been a top to bottom approach. Now we want to go rural first.

Most projects in the water sector had stalled post-crisis, Thondaman said, and the priority now was to resume them before attracting further investment into the sector. The minister said that there had been discussions with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Asian Development Bank. (Colombo/Feb27/2024)
