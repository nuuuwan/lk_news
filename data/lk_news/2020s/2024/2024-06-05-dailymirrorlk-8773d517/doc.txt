Grade One admissions on the decline: Minister

Parliament, June 5 (Daily Mirror)- Admissions to the Grade One are on the decline as a result of the falling birth rate, Minister of Education Susil Premajayantha told Parliament today.

“Sri Lanka’s annual birth rate which was  330,000 a few years ago has reduced to 300,000 as of now. This will result in a decline in Grade One admissions in the near future,” he said.

He said children in Sri Lanka are moving away from schools and are drawn towards tuition classes because children have lost trust in the country's education system.
