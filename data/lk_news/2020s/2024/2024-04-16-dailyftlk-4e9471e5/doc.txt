Aspiring Sri Lankan tech start up to disrupt global EdTech landscape with HEAD

Sri Lankan technology start up 200ne CODE is making waves in the educational technology (EdTech) sector with the launch of HEADleads, the first pillar of its highly advanced innovative educational ecosystem – HEAD (Higher Education Academic Database).

HEAD leads addresses a major pain point for institutions by offering a streamlined enrolment process including an AI-powered Know Your Customer (KYC) verification system ensuring secure and efficient student onboarding.

Developed leveraging global partnerships for the highest standards in data security. Headlands tackles the longstanding challenges that plague traditional enrolment processes. Inefficient manual tasks, limited data insights, and inconsistent communication are things of the past. Headlands empowers institutions to streamline workflows, gain actionable enrolment data, and personalise their outreach for maximum impact. This powerful student lead management module automates tedious processes like lead capture and qualification, freeing up valuable staff time for strategic initiatives.

HEADleads prioritises data security through its AI-powered KYC verification system. This system adheres to the highest global standards, including ISO 27001 (information security management), SOC2 (service organisation controls), PCI DSS (payment card industry data security standard), GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), QG GDPR (Qatar General Data Protection Regulation), and CYBERESSENTIALS Certification. These rigorous standards are achieved through partnerships with leading global providers specialising in secure data management. This comprehensive approach fosters trust with students and provides institutions with peace of mind.

HEADleads marks the exciting first step in a comprehensive educational ecosystem designed to transform higher educational institutes. 200ne CODE is committed to long-term innovation, crafting a seamlessly integrated suite of solutions that build upon the foundation laid by HEADleads.

HEADcomms, which is a communication automation platform designed to work alongside higher education enrolment systems and learning management systems, will be launched on 29 May.

In today’s fast-paced environment, clear and consistent communication is crucial. HEADcomms empowers Institutions to streamline interactions with students and faculty through automated SMS and email tools. This frees up valuable staff time while ensuring everyone stays informed and engaged.

HEADlms: Learning and Teaching made interactive is slated for launch on 5 August. HEADlms is designed to be the world’s most seamless and interactive Learning Management System. It seeks to transform the learning and teaching experience with its intuitive interface, personalised learning, and robust tools for real-time collaboration and support. Both students and instructors benefit from data-driven insights into progress, ensuring timely interventions and informed course adjustments.

Developed entirely by Sri Lankan talent, HEAD positions Sri Lanka as a key player in the global educational technology landscape. This homegrown innovation sets a new standard for efficiency, accessibility, and personalisation in learning. By equipping institutions and students with the critical digital and thinking skills needed for the 21st century, HEAD is poised to transform education on a global scale.

200ne CODE Founder Dumidu Thabrew said, “We believe Sri Lanka has the potential to be a global hub for EdTech innovation. HEADleads is just the first step in our mission to empower institutions and students across the globe with world-class educational technology. We are confident that HEAD will not only streamline enrolment but also transform the entire learning experience, fostering a generation of future-ready graduates.

We’re here to prove that world-class EdTech can come from anywhere, and empower students everywhere.”
