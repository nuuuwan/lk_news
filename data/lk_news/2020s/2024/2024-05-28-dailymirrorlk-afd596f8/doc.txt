Special bus service for Poson Poya due to northern railway delays

Colombo, May 28 (Daily Mirror) - Special bus services will be arranged for Poson Poya to avoid inconvenience to passengers as the development work of the Northern Railway will be delayed by another two months, Cabinet Spokesman and Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardana said.

Addressing the media, he said that the Sri Lanka Railways Department engineers have been informed that this delay is due to rain and adverse weather and having to bear higher costs than expected.

He further said that using the bus service, people can travel more than those who travel by train.
