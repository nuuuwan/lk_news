Growing Together: Sarvodaya Development Finance’s Pledge to Elevate Sri Lanka’s Agriculture Sector

Sarvodaya Development Finance (SDF) is more than just a financial institution; it serves as a driving force for change within Sri Lanka’s agricultural domain. With a steadfast dedication to the nation’s farming community, SDF has embarked on a transformative journey to uplift the Agri Sector, exceeding expectations in terms of support, sustainability, and growth.

In an impressive achievement, SDF’s agri portfolio has surged beyond LKR 4 billion, highlighting the trust and confidence bestowed upon the institution by farmers across the country. Over half of the pledged units have already been settled well ahead of the schedule, showcasing the strong bond between SDF and the farming community.

Through strategic partnerships with industry leaders like Diesel & Motor Engineering Plc (DIMO), Hayleys Agriculture Holdings Limited, and Brown & Company Plc, SDF has contacted farmers in Ampara, Polonnaruwa, Anuradhapura, and Kurunegala districts. By providing state-of-the-art equipment, such as combined harvester machines on flexible repayment terms, SDF not only minimizes waste by modernizing their practices but also addresses labour shortages, enhancing productivity and efficiency in agriculture.

Beyond Financial Support: Cultivating Sustainable Agriculture SDF’s commitment transcends conventional financial services. Teaming up with Araliya Agro Holdings (Pvt) Ltd and Araliya Seeds (Pvt) Ltd, SDF ensures the availability of premium-quality seed paddy while promoting optimal fertilizer usage through innovative techniques. Agronomists, practitioners, and exemplary farmers within SDF’s ranks play a pivotal role in disseminating knowledge, advocating regenerative agriculture practices, and safeguarding land and soil health for future generations.

Chief Executive Officer Nilantha Jayanetti envisions a future where the term “rich farmer” supplants the traditional notion of a “poor farmer” in Sri Lanka. Through its initiatives, SDF extends financial assistance and fosters a culture of prosperity and sustainability within the agricultural community.

In collaboration with Sri Lanka’s farmers, Sarvodaya Development Finance is sowing the seeds of prosperity and ushering in a new era of agricultural excellence.
