Sri Lanka is a centre of gravity for economic development - JICA President

Sri Lanka is a centre of gravity of global economic development, President of Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Dr. Tanaka Akihito has said, reiterating that JICA would continuously assist the development and reform agenda of the island nation.

His remark came during a discussion with Sri Lankan Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena at the Temple Trees in Colombo on Wednesday (Feb.14), the PM’s Office said in a press release.

PM Gunawardena thanked Dr Akihito for the support extended to Sri Lanka for decades since JICA became a member of Sri Lanka Aid Consortium in 1968. He urged JICA to consider new projects for rural development, rural road construction, and empowerment of small- and medium-sector farmers and entrepreneurs.

Dr Akihito asserted that JICA would provide a grant for a new renewable energy programme which will include the establishment of solar energy units at hospitals in Sri Lanka. Noting the completion of Safe Water Supply Project in Anuradhapura by JICA, he said he plans to attend its opening ceremony today. The Prime Minister thanked Japan for the project and said it would benefit Anuradhapura District, a locality affected by kidney disease due to impure water.

JICA President praised the Sri Lankan government for the quick recovery made after a severe economic crisis and said the country is now back on track for rapid growth. “The global growth has shifted to the Asia Pacific region and in this Sri Lanka is a centre of gravity in world economic growth,” he said, assuring JICA’s commitment to continue to be a partner in this process.

He stressed the need for expediting the project to expand the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake, as it would help the country attract more tourists and also for Sri Lanka to be an important aviation hub.

JICA implements a wide range of projects across the country. They include infrastructure development, expanding social services, developing human resources and rural communities, enhancing small- and medium-scale enterprises, disaster management and climate change.

JICA President is on a visit to Sri Lanka to ascertain the development requirements to plan future assistance programmes and projects. He added that JICA focuses its assistance on uplifting the agriculture and rural industries, developing rural communities and expanding social services related to education and health and assured continuous project support to Sri Lanka.
