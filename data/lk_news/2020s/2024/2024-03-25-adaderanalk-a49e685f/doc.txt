Buddha Sasana Ministry issues statement over New Year auspicious times

The Ministry of Buddha Sasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs has requested the public to follow the official list of auspicious times issued by the State Astrologers’ Committee for the 2024 Sinhala and Tamil New Year.

Sri Lanka’s 42-member group of astrologers employed by the Cultural Affairs ministry were split for the first time on deciding the best date for New Year (Aluth Aurudu) celebrations with some warning of “disaster” and accusing rivals of misinterpreting the position of stars.

The majority set the dawn of the traditional Sinhala and Tamil New Year on the night of April 13, however, some claim the time was wrong and would lead the country into “disaster.”

However, the Ministry of Buddha Sasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs has today issued a special statement regarding the matter while urging the public to follow the official list of auspicious times issued by the State Astrologers’ Committee.
