Sri Lanka stocks close up, LOLC Finance trade pushes turnover past 2.2bn

ECONOMYNEXT – The Colombo Stock Exchange closed up on Wednesday, data on its site showed.

The broader All Share Index closed up 0.37 percent, or 40.07 points, at 10,881; while the S&P SL20 Index closed up 0.26 percent, or 8.05 points, at 3,100.

Turnover topped 2.2 billion. Nearly half of this came from an LOLC Finance Plc trade (1bn), which market participants speculated was an internal transfer, possibly foreign selling and local buying. The share closed up at 4.80.

Lanka Milk Foods (CWE) Plc also saw some activity (151mn), and the share closed up at 26.50.

“There was some selling pressure in the morning but then it picked up. We see interest in the equity market returning with the low interest rates,” a market participant said.

Companies contributing to the All Share Price Index in the day were Commercial Bank of Ceylon Plc (up at 90.90), Chevron Lubricants Lanka Plc (up at 106.25), and Sunshine Holdings Plc (up at 56.90).

“With Chevron, it’s the last day of XD, or ex-dividend date, so volumes picked up; in the case of Commercial Bank we are seeing interest returning in the banking sector after the weeks of selling pressure eased off.”

Buying interest was seen across all sectors, they said. (Colombo/Mar6/2024)
