Sri Lanka’s rough rice forecast hiked to 2.02mn tonnes for 2024 Yala season

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s minor (Yala) season rough rice crop is projected at 2.02 million metric tonnes with 488,957 hectares cultivated up to end August, the Department of Agriculture said.

The projection is up from 1.77mn metric tonnes based in July based on cultivation progress at the time.

After the seed paddy requirement of 80,000 MT, and abut 120,000MT of wastage, about 1.82 million metric tonnes of paddy would be available for milling.

After milling, about 1.24 million metric tonnes of rice would be available for consumption.

Sri Lanka harvested about 2.42 million metric tonnes of rice in the main Maha season that ends around March, which would give a total production of 4.24 million MT of paddy for the year or 2.88 million tonnes of rice.

Based on current consumption trends, there would be excess of about 420,000 MT of rice this year.

Due to years of protection, Sri Lanka’s rice is usually not export grade and the prices are also too high. (Colombo/Oct20/2024)
