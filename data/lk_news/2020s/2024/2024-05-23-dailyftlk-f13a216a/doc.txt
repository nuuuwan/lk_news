“Tea for Harmony-Yaji” Cultural Salon

The Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in partnership with the Department of Culture and Tourism of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region on Tuesday held “Tea for Harmony-Yaji” Cultural Salon in celebration of International Tea Day.

Chinese Ambassador Qi Zhenhong, Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, and Department of Culture and Tourism of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Level-I Counsel Lai Fuqiang were present at the event.

Ambassador Qi Zhenhong said China is the birthplace of tea and tea is not only a beverage but also the crystallisation of civilisation and knowledge passed down from generation to generation. It is not only a way of life but also an integral part of Chinese history and culture.

In terms of Sri Lanka, he said Ceylon tea is well known worldwide, has a unique history and cultural heritage and the people of China and Sri Lanka share a long history of growing, making, tasting and drinking tea, fostering exchanges and mutual learning.

“Tea, as a medium, will further promote cultural exchanges between the two countries and strengthen the friendship between the two peoples,” Ambassador Qi Zhenhong emphasised. The event included demonstration of “Traditional Chinese tea-making techniques and related customs” which are included in the UNESCO Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. A range of traditional performances of dance, song and music from Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region was a key feature of the celebrations along with performances of Sri Lankan music and dance.
