Bangladesh beat Sri Lanka by two wickets

In a thrilling T20 World Cup fixture, Bangladesh clinched a two-wicket victory over former champions Sri Lanka.

Leg-spinner Rishad Hossain’s match-winning figures of 3/22, complemented by Mustafizur Rahman’s 3/17, restricted Sri Lanka to a modest 124 for 9 in 20 overs.

Despite opener Pathum Nissanka’s 47 off 28 balls for Sri Lanka, crucial knocks from Towhid Hridoy (40) and Mahmudullah (16*) helped Bangladesh secure the win with an over to spare.

The win was Bangladesh’s first over Sri Lanka across three World Cup meetings, setting them off the blocks in a competitive group.

Sri Lanka have now lost two successive matches and find themselves at the bottom of the group. They will face Nepal next on Wednesday in Florida.

Meanwhile, Bangladesh will face group toppers South Africa in New York on Monday.
