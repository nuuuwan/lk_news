Police seeks court order to repatriate ASP involved in Uddika’s self-orchestrated shooting

An Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) believed to have helped former Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Anuradhapura district MP Uddika Premaratne to orchestrate a shooting against himself has fled Sri Lanka, according to the police.

ASP Sanjeewa Mahanama who had supported the actor turned politician had been attached to the Police Transport Division and based in Anuradhapura at the time of the incident.

It is believed the ASP had carried out the shooting on the instructions of Premaratne. According to reports, Mahanama had returned his service pistol to the police through a third party after fleeing the country on 12 June. Police Spokesperson DIG Nihal Thalduwa said Mahanama had not obtained necessary permission to leave the country.

Police sources said they plan to seek a court order for Mahanama’s repatriation.

On 17 September 2023, a group of unidentified gunmen opened fire at Premaratne’s car shortly after he returned to his residence in Anuradhapura. The Parliamentarian managed to escape unharmed.

The perpetrators, who arrived in a car, targeted the Parliamentarian as he walked towards his house after parking his vehicle. The left rear door glass of Premaratne’s car was damaged in the shooting, believed to have been carried out with a pistol.

Anuradhapura police initiated investigations immediately after the incident was reported. Subsequently, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) took over the investigation.

At the time the former MP claimed that the existing system in the country was the reason behind the recent shooting incident targeting him. Speaking in Parliament, MP Premaratne expressed that he believed the system was not only the cause of the shooting outside his residence but also the reason for the country’s current state.

On 27 February 2024, the MP resigned from Parliament. Premaratne was later reported to have flown to Canada, allegedly seeking political asylum. However, he refuted these claims, stating that he was expecting a work visa in Canada. The police are also seeking to obtain a statement from the actor in connection to the incident.
