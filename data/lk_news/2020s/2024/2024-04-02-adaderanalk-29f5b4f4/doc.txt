Gnanasara Thero’s bail application rejected

The Colombo High Court on Tuesday (02) rejected the bail application filed by the General Secretary of Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thero, who was recently handed a 4-year rigorous imprisonment.

High Court Judge Aditya Patabendige conveyed the decision when the bail application put forward by the defense attorneys requesting the court to release their client on bail was taken up before the court on Tuesday morning.

On March 28, Judge Patabendige sentenced the BBS General Secretary to four years of rigorous imprisonment for the defamatory comments made against Islam in late 2016.

Gnanasara Thero had been accused of making defamatory comments against Islam during a 2016 media briefing convened with respect to the Kuragala Buddhist monastery, causing damage to national and religious harmony.

The judge had found the monk guilty of the two indictments filed by the Attorney General under the Penal Code. Accordingly, the accused was sentenced to two years of rigorous imprisonment for each indictment and was imposed two fines of Rs. 50,000 each. He also ordered that the two sentences be served separately.

Gnanasara Thero’s prison sentence will be extended by two more years in the event of his failure to pay the fine.

The case had been filed based on a complaint filed by former MPs Mujibur Rahman and Azath Salley.
