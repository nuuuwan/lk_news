Same-sex couple resists husbandsâ€™ efforts to take them home

Pandemonium broke out at the Kandy Police Station when the husbands of two women who were in a same-sex relationship attempted to take them home from the hotel where the two were staying at in Kandy.

Police investigations revealed that a 34-year-old married woman from Wattala had been taking her child to school in Kandana, where she formed a clandestine relationship with a 29-year-old female teacher. According to the police, the same-sex couple had disappeared from their homes around a month ago. Their husbands reported their disappearance to both Kandana and Wattala Police, providing photos of the two women to all police stations. Meanwhile, a vigilant police officer at Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy spotted two women fitting the description of the missing individuals during a visit today. Subsequently, Kandy Police took them into custody and interrogated them, discovering that they had been residing at a guest house in the Suduhumpola area of Kandy.

Their husbands were called to the Kandy Police Station, and upon arrival with their children to take the women home, the two protested vehemently, crying out to both the police and their husbands not to separate them.

They also declined their children's pleas to return home. Despite their resistance, one woman was forcefully taken away by her husband in a van, while the other, weeping and wailing, reluctantly followed her husband and children.

A police team led by HQI Rasika Sampath conducted inquiries to facilitate the reunion of the two women with their families.
