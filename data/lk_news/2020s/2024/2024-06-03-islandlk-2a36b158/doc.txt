On top of the world

Sampath Siriwardena, General Manager, Galadari Hotel, Colombo, is on top of the world at the moment!

The hotel has been certified as a Great Place To Work and Sampath had this to say: “I take this opportunity to thank our employees for their powerful voiced opinions that enabled us to be certified as a Great Place To Work.

“It’s with great pride that I announce that Galadari Hotel has won the trust of our employees.”

Sampath also came in for special praise, on social media, from many, including musicians.

My best wishes to Sampath who always reaches out to us musicians!

It is a great pleasure working there. Congratulations and best wishes Mr Sampath Siriwardena.

A great GM, friend and a humble person. I call him ‘The Singing GM.’ He started the Magarita Blue…at the Galadari Hotel, and it was the place for all bands, with good entertainment, food and drink. Thank you Sir! You are Simply the Best.

Congrats Sampath Siriwardena. Good luck and all the best to you for many more awards and nominations.
