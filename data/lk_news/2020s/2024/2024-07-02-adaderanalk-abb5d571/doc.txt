Interim order issued against Dayasiri’s expulsion from SLFP

The Colombo District Court has issued an interim order against the Sri Lanka Freedom Party’s (SLFP) decision to expel MP Dayasiri Jayasekara from party membership and the post of General Secretary, Ada Derana reporter said.

Jayasekara, who was the former General Secretary of the SLFP, had sought an order revoking the decisions taken by the party to oust him from the position he held within the party.

Jayasekara had filed the complaint before the Colombo District Court, challenging the decision taken by the SLFP to expel him as the party’s General Secretary and a letter directed by the party’s then chairman Maithripala Sirisena which mentioned that a disciplinary inquiry would be conducted against Jayasekara and asked him to provide excuses to defend himself.

On September 05, 2023, MP Dayasiri Jayasekara was ousted from the SLFP with immediate effect and he was stripped of his position as the party’s general secretary.

The then SLFP chairman, former President Maithripala Sirisena communicated this to MP Jayasekara in a letter, adding that a disciplinary inquiry would also be initiated against the parliamentarian pursuant to the provisions of the party’s constitution.

However, addressing concerns pertaining to MP Jayasekara’s removal, former President Sirisena had stated that the party membership was only temporarily suspended.

He further asserted that the SLFP was ready to accept the MP as a party member, or any other title he may wish to hold within the part, except that of the SLFP General Secretary.
