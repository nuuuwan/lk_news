# Strengthening bilateral ties

On 4 May, following the traditional New Year celebrations in Sri Lanka, the members of Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification in Sri Lanka – led by the Presidnet Zhang Xudong – visited Warusavithana Elders Home in Galle and donated some daily necessities such as; rice, noodles, cooking oil, milk powder, and so on.

The Warusavithana Elders Home is the first military nursing home to accommodate disabled veterans and widows of martyrs who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the battlefield. They are also the long-term fixed-point support of the Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification in Sri Lanka.

The war has torn families apart and hurt peoples. Therefore, the association aims to call for peace around the world and avoid the terrible harm caused by war. The Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification in Sri Lanka will always contribute to the friendship between Sri Lanka and China. Special thanks should go to the Sri Lankan Government for its firm support of the One-China principle. May our great motherland China achieve peaceful reunification soon!
