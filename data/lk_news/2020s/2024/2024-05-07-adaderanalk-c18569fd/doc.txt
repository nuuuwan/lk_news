‘Manna Ramesh’ repatriated to Sri Lanka from Dubai

Underworld criminal gang leader Ramesh Priyajanaka, also known as ‘Manna Ramesh’, who was arrested in Dubai has been brought back to Sri Lanka this morning (07) by a team of CID officers, the Police Spokesman said.

DIG Nihal Thalduwa said the special team of CID officers accompanying the wanted underworld figure had reached the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake this morning (07).

On March 06, it was reported that Sri Lankan security forces had been informed that notorious underworld figure Ramesh Priyajanaka, alias ‘Manna Ramesh’, had been arrested in Dubai, UAE.

Accordingly, a group of police officers were later dispatched to Dubai to escort the wanted criminal back to Sri Lanka, upon a request made to the Dubai Police that he be handed over to Sri Lankan authorities.

‘Manna Ramesh’ is wanted by Sri Lanka Police for numerous crimes including multiple murders in the Avissawella area and surrounding areas while he is suspected to be a leader of a organised criminal gang who orchestrated many crimes while residing in Dubai.

The underworld gang is believed to be responsible for many crimes including murders, drug trafficking and extortion rackets.

The CID is to carry out further investigations into the repatriated criminal figure.
