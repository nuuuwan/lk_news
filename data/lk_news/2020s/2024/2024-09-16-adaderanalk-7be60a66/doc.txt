Dunith Wellalage named ICC Men’s Player of the Month

Dunith Wellalage’s all-round brilliance against India helped him win the ICC Men’s Player of the Month award for August 2024. The 21-year-old overcame competition from South Africa’s Keshav Maharaj and West Indies’ Jayden Seales to secure the award.

Wellalage, the former Sri Lanka U19 skipper, made big strides in his nascent international career in August 2024. With his help, Sri Lanka overcame India for the first time in a bilateral ODI series since 1997.

The Island nation had a significant challenge in the form of India, the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup runner-up. The Men in Blue had already secured a 3-0 T20I series win against Sri Lanka and with the return of top stars like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, India were easily the favourites to win the ODI series.

Wellalage with 108 runs and seven wickets helped Sri Lanka overcome the India challenge in the series, contributing at crucial stages of each game.

He scored a career-best 67* and followed it up with wickets of Rohit and Shubman Gill in the first ODI that ended in a thrilling tie.

He made another crucial contribution with a fighting 39 in the second ODI that helped Sri Lanka to a winning total. He didn’t click with the bat in the third game, but went on to achieve the career-best figures of 5/27, derailing the India innings before it could take off, getting the important wickets of Kohli, Rohit, and Shreyas Iyer on the way to his five-for.

“This recognition gives me further strength to continue doing the good work I do as a player and contribute to my team to reach excellence in the field.

“I wish to thank my teammates, parents, friends, and relatives, as I am sure my achievement will provide them great satisfaction, as they have been supporting me all throughout.

“Recognition such as this, coming from the International Cricket Council, is great news for young players like us and will certainly encourage young players in the game.”

It’s double delight for Sri Lanka this month, with compatriot Harshita Samarawickrama winning the ICC Women’s Player of the Month award for August.

Wellalage joins teammate Kamindu Mendis as Sri Lankan men’s award winners in 2024, with Mendis claiming ICC Men’s Player of the Month for March.
