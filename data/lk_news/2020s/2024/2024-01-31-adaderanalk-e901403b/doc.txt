Appeals Court to decide on contempt cases against Sanath Nishantha

The Court of Appeal has moved to February the petitions filed against the late State Minister Sanath Nishantha over contempt of court charges.

The two-member judge bench consisting of Justices Sobhitha Rajakaruna and Dhammika Ganepola ordered that since the defendant of the case State Minister Sanath Nishantha has passed away, the future actions to be taken regarding the petitions will be decided on February 02, 2024.

This order was issued when the relevant petitions filed by Attorney-at-Law Priyalal Sirisena and Attorney-at-Law Vijitha Kumara were taken up before the Court of Appeals today (Jan 31).
