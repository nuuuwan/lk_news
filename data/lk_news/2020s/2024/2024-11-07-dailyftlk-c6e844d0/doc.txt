Korea extends $ 10.2 m grant for integrated solid waste management project

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved a new project aimed at establishing an integrated solid waste management system in the Uva and Northern Provinces. The initiative will be funded by a $ 10.2 million grant from the Korean Government and will be implemented from 2024 to 2028.

“The Korean International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) will provide technical assistance to help local governments address solid waste management challenges and develop sustainable solutions,” Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Vijitha Herath said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

The project focuses on improving waste management infrastructure and practices at the local government level in the two Provinces, where inadequate waste disposal has created environmental and health issues. With Korea’s expertise in sustainable waste management, the Government aims to develop an efficient, environmentally friendly system to address these challenges.
