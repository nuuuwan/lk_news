Sri Lanka MP Thalatha Athukorala resigns

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka Samagi Jana Balavegaya legislator Thalatha Athukorala has announced her resignation in Parliament.

Athukorala is the sister of one-time United National Party general Secretary Gamini Athukorala, and a party stalwart.

“If we are to win this election, we have to join forces,” Athukorala said in an impassioned speech, in which she lamented the splitting of the UNP.

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa was too much in a hurry to become leader, she said drawing parallels with the rise of Gotabaya Rajapaksa.

“All the drowning snakes and mongooses (nai-mugati) have clung on the SJB log (kote) to avoid drowning,” she said in a scathing attack on Premadasa. (Colombo/Aug21/2024)
