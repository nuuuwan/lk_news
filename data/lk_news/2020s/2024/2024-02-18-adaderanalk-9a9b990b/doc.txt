CID arrests close associate of ‘Piyuma’

A close associate of criminal gang member Piyum Hasthika alias ‘Piyuma’ was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Saturday (17 Feb.).

The female suspect, identified as a friend of Piyum Hasthika’s wife, was arrested upon her arrival in the country from Dubai, police reported, adding that the CID had subsequently recorded a statement from her for nearly four hours.

According to police, ‘Piyuma’ had revealed a series of important facts about the crimes he committed, adding that he and the notorious underworld figure and drug trafficker Salindu Malshika Gunaratne alias ‘Kudu Salindu’ have been childhood friends.

‘Piyuma’ was repatriated to Sri Lanka from Dubai on 15 February, after which the CID secured a 72-hour detention order under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) from the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court.

According to the Public Security Ministry, the criminal suspect was brought back to the island by a special team of the CID.

As per police records, ‘Piyuma’ was first arrested in 2018 for the possession of 20g of heroin and had been referred to a rehabilitation centre for three months.

He was reportedly complicit in the January 2021 shooting that claimed the life of a youth named Lakshan Sandaruwan in Panadura North. Two years after the murder, he was identified as one of the two assailants involved. The investigating officers later learned that ‘Piyuma’ had fled to Dubai to evade arrest.

In June 2022, ‘Piyuma’ was involved in another shooting, which he had orchestrated under the instructions of ‘Kudu Salindu’ for the killing of Nilantha Kumara and Mohammed Samsad in Katubedda, Moratuwa.

On this account, a Red Notice was subsequently secured from Interpol in November 2023 to apprehend and repatriate ‘Piyuma’ to Sri Lanka.
