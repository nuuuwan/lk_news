Sri Lanka parliament passes new electricity law

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s parliament has passed a new electricity law, speaker Mahinda Abeywardena said, with 103 legislators out of the 225 member assembly voting in favour.

Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said the bill will unbundle the sector and help take the grid to a 70 percent renewable energy target.

The target requires 12 billion dollars of investments which the government cannot provide, he said.

Sri Lanka’s main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya said the renewable plants are being awarded without competitive tenders.

There were also criticisms that the Minister gets too much powers and the regulator’s independence is undermined.

However, Wijesekera said the the Minister needed powers to implement policy.

Opposition legislator Kabir Hashim said a minister was only a caretaker of a public asset and cannot behave like the head of a private company. (Colombo/June06/2024)
