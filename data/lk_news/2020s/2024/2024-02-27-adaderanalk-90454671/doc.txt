The Department of Meteorology says showers will occur at times in Nuwara-Eliya, Matale and Polonnaruwa districts.

Several spells of showers will occur in Eastern and Uva provinces and in Anuradhapura district.

Showers or thundershowers may occur at a few places in Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces and in Kandy, Galle and Matara districts in the evening or night.

Fairly strong winds about 30-40 kmph can be expected at times in eastern slopes of the central hills and in Northern, North-central, North-western, Southern, Uva and Eastern provinces.
