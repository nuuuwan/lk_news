New Acting Attorney General takes oath

Senior Additional Solicitor General Parinda Ranasinghe took oaths as the Acting Attorney General before the Chief Justice, Ada Derana reporter said.

Last week, it was reported that the proposal to extend incumbent Attorney General Sanjay Rajaratnam’s term by another 06 months was defeated for the second time at the Constitutional Council meeting.

The proposal, which was submitted by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, was defeated with 05 votes against it while 03 members voted in favour.

Rajaratnam’s current term is set to expire at the end of this month, and the President had proposed an extension for an additional six months.

However, the proposal requires the approval of the Constitutional Council, which twice defeated it.

Accordingly, Senior Additional Solicitor General Parinda Ranasinghe, who is the son of former Chief Justice K. A. Parinda Ranasinghe has been appointed as the Acting AG.
