Healthy and radiant skin…

Hi! Thought of giving you something different, this week, for you to try out.

Like me, I know all the lovely ladies like to keep their face…always beautiful.

You will need 01 tablespoon ground flaxseed, 01 tablespoon white flour, 01 teaspoon olive oil, and 02 tablespoons non-sugar yoghurt…yes, plain yoghurt.

In a small bowl, combine the ground flaxseed with the white flour. Then add the olive oil to the mixture. Next, gradually mix in the 02 tablespoons of non-sugar yoghurt (plain yoghurt). Stir well until you achieve a smooth paste-like consistency.

(You can adjust the consistency of the mask by adding more yoghurt if it’s too thick, or more flour if it’s too runny.)

Wash your face thoroughly with a gentle cleanser and pat dry with a towel.

Apply the mask evenly to your face, avoiding the eye area, and allow the mask to sit on your face for about 15-20 minutes.

Once the time is up, rinse your face with lukewarm water to remove the mask completely.

Pat your face dry with a clean towel and follow up with your regular moisturizer.

Flaxseed contains omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants that help to nourish and moisturize the skin, improving overall skin texture and reducing inflammation.

White Flour acts as a gentle exfoliant, helping to remove dead skin cells and promote a smoother complexion.

Olive Oil provides hydration and antioxidants to the skin, helping to maintain moisture and protect against environmental damage.

Non-Sugar Yoghurt contains probiotics that can soothe the skin, reduce redness, and provide gentle exfoliation.

By the way, I would suggest that you perform a patch test before applying the mask to ensure you don’t have any allergic reactions to any of the ingredients.

(Use this mask once a week for best results to maintain a healthy and radiant skin)
