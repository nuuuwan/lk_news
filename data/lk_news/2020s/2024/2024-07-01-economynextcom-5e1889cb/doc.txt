Sri Lanka to digitize motor traffic department operations despite complaints: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will commence digitalization of its Motor Traffic Department, including introducing an e-ticket system despite opposition, Minister of Transport Bandula Gunawardena has said.

“We are trying to digitalize the Department of Motor Traffic,” Gunawardena told reporters on Monday. “We are also trying to digitalize the way in which fees are being calculated in the expressway by calling for tenders.”

However, Gunawardena said that despite proposals for an e-ticketing system to combat theft by bus conductors, there has been opposition for transportation workers who take the matter to court.

“There are various obstacles and it is not just obstacles, they are going to court. Because of this, till the court judgment comes, we can’t do anything,” Gunawardena said. (Colombo/Jul1/2024)
