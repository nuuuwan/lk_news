Foreign Minister urges Tamil diaspora to avoid following political agendas

Sri Lanka’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry says that the western countries have shown their ‘double standards’ by ‘turning a blind eye’ to the crisis in Gaza and that, serious amendments must be made to the international laws on how the United Nations functions in order to protect international democracy.

Joining Ada Derana’s current affairs programme, ‘At Hydepark’, the Minister stated that Sri Lanka is of the view that the Israel-Palestine war must come to an end immediately and both countries must exist as per the borders announced in 1965.

Reflecting on the situation in Gaza, Sabry pointed out that 143 countries have voted to recognize Palestine. He advocated for a peaceful coexistence between Palestinians and Israelis, stressing the need for the establishment of a Palestinian government within five years.

“You cannot continue with double standards and hypocrisy,” he asserted.

Commenting on the Sri Lanka’s human rights allegations and reconciliation efforts, Sabry reaffirmed the country’s commitment to improving the human rights conditions of its citizens. He acknowledged the grievances of the 6,700 individuals who have reported missing loved ones and emphasized the importance of creating a conducive environment for reconciliation in Sri Lanka.

He also urged the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora to avoid following political agendas and highlighted the need for development and power devolution in the North and East of the country.
