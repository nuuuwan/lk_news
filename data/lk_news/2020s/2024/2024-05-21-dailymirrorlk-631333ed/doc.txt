Low-pressure area in Bay of Bengal likely to turn into depression by Friday

Colombo, May 21 (Daily Mirror) - A low-pressure area over the south-west Bay of Bengal is likely to move initially north-eastward and concentrate into a depression over the central parts of the Bay of Bengal by Friday (24), the Meteorology Department said today.

Accordingly, strong winds accompanied by heavy rainfall and very rough seas are likely over the sea areas around the country and over the south-eastern Arabian Sea areas and south-western Bay of Bengal sea areas.

Therefore, the naval and fishing communities in the deep-sea areas in the south-eastern Arabian Sea and in the south-western Bay of Bengal areas are advised not to venture out to the seas until further notice.

Moreover, the sea areas extending from Colombo to Pottuvil via Galle and Hambantota will be rough at times with very strong gusty winds up to 70 kmph.

The sea areas extending from Kalpitiya to Colombo will be rough, with strong gusty winds up to 60 kmph. Therefore, the naval and fishing communities engaged in fishing and naval activities in the above-mentioned sea areas are also requested to be vigilant in this regard.

The swell waves of about 2.5 to 3.0 metres in height may increase in the sea areas off the coast, extending from Kalpitiya to Pottuvil via Colombo, Galle and Hambantota.

There is a possibility of the near-shore sea areas off the coast extending from Colombo to Matara via Galle experiencing surges due to swell waves.
