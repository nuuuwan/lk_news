A few showers may occur in Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces and in Galle and Matara districts, says the Department of Meteorology.

Strong winds of about 50-55kmph can be expected at times over Western slopes of the central hills and in Northern, North-central and North-western provinces and in Trincomalee, Monaragala and Hambantota districts.

Fairly strong winds of about 30-40kmph can be expected at times elsewhere in the island, it said.
