CAA calls for reduction of bakery product prices

According to the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA), the prices of egg-based bakery products should also decrease in line with the reduction in the price of eggs in the market.

The Chairman of the CAA, Thusitha Indrajith, stated that the price of an egg, which was previously sold at a high price, is now between Rs. 28 and Rs. 35.

He further emphasized that steps should be taken to pass this benefit on to consumers.
