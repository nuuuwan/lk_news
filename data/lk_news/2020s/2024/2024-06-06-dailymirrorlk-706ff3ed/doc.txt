Floods may trigger dengue epidemic, warns health expert

June 06 - While emphasizing the critical importance of effectively managing the spread of the dengue, Director of the National Dengue Control Unit Dr. Sudath Samaraweera noted that the current flood situation could potentially escalate the dengue outbreak to an epidemic level.

Dr. Sudath Samaraweera, a specialist, made this revelation while participating in a special news conference held at the Presidential Media Centre today (06).
