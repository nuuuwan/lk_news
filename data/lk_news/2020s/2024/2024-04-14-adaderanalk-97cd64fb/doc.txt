Advisory issued for rising temperatures in parts of the island

The heat index, the temperature felt on the human body, is expected to increase up to the ‘Caution’ level (39°C – 45°C) in some places in Western and North-Western provinces and Mannar district, says the Department of Meteorology.

The advisory, issued at 04.00 p.m. today (14), is effective until tomorrow (15), it added.

The advisory cautions of heat cramps and heat exhaustion; continued activity could result in heatstroke, it further warns.

The Heat Index Forecast is calculated by using relative humidity and maximum temperature and this is the condition that is felt on the human body, says the Meteorology Department.

The department further says this is not the forecast of maximum temperature. It is generated by the Department of Meteorology for the next day period and prepared by using global numerical weather prediction model data, the advisory further read.
