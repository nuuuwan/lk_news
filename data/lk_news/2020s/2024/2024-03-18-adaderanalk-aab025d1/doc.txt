Somali pirate threat: Sri Lankaâ€™s fishermen warned not to venture into Arabian Sea

The Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources has warned the fishing community in Sri Lanka not to venture into the Arabian Sea for poaching activities during these days.

This announcement comes as a result of reports of an incident of an armed Somali group hijacking an Iranian fishing boat in the Arabian Sea on Saturday (16).

Joining a press conference held at the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources on Monday (18), its Director General Susantha Kahawatta said that information has been received that a group of Somali pirates remain in the relevant sea area with an Iranian vessel.
