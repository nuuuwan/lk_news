Attorney General opposes bail for Hirunika in ongoing appeal

The Attorney General yesterday raised objections to granting bail to former Parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra, who is seeking bail pending appeal.

During a session before Colombo High Court Judge Amal Ranaraja, the Attorney General requested additional time to submit written arguments against the bail application.

Consequently, the High Court has rescheduled the bail hearing for 11 July.

Premachandra, a former Colombo District MP, was sentenced to three years in prison for her role in the abduction of a youth using a Defender vehicle.

She has appealed to the Court of Appeal, challenging her conviction and the sentence handed down by the Colombo High Court.

Premachandra was convicted on 18 charges, including conspiracy, aiding in the abduction, threatening, assaulting and intimidating the victim, Amila Priyankara, in Dematagoda.

As the ninth accused in the case, she maintained her innocence throughout the trial. In addition to her prison sentence, the court imposed a fine of Rs. 20,000 for each charge.

The upcoming hearing on 11 July will determine whether Premachandra will be granted bail as her appeal progresses through the legal system.
