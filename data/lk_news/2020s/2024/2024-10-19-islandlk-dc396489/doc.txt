Sampath Bank partners with Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka to launch historic trilingual concert

Sampath Bank is proud to announce its sponsorship of the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka’s (SOSL) groundbreaking trilingual concert, set to take place on the 19th and 20th of October at Bishop’s College Auditorium. This landmark event will not only introduce the concept of a trilingual symphony orchestra concert for the first time in Sri Lanka but also serve to revive the beloved Pops Concert tradition, showcasing the versatility and talent of SOSL.

As the sole sponsor, Sampath Bank PLC is thrilled to support this pioneering initiative, which reaffirms the Bank’s commitment to promoting the arts and fostering cultural inclusivity. This sponsorship aligns with Sampath Bank’s heritage as a truly Sri Lankan bank, where merging Western classical traditions with Sri Lankan music creates a future enriched by the magnificence of orchestral sounds, as the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka pays homage to the nation’s rich diversity.

While the event on the 20th of October is open to the public, the performance on the 19th will be an exclusive experience for over 600 specially invited Sampath Bank customers, offering them a unique opportunity to enjoy this historic concert. Given the limited seating, these customers were selected based on their interest in similar events, and the Bank looks forward to inviting more customers to such exclusive experiences in the future.

Through initiatives like these, Sampath Bank remains dedicated to creating curated experiences for its discerning customers, focusing on fostering meaningful connections and delivering value beyond traditional banking services. Sponsoring this trilingual concert aligns with the Bank’s broader efforts to cultivate stronger relationships with existing and potential customers, particularly among the High-Net-Worth Families.

By supporting landmark events like this, Sampath Bank aims to elevate its brand awareness while reinforcing its ethos of providing enriching and exclusive experiences to its clientele.
