Viyaskanth replaces Hasaranga in Sunrisers Squad for IPL 2024

April 09 - Sunrisers Hyderabad have signed Sri Lankan leggie Vijayakanth Viyaskanth as replacement for Wanindu Hasaranga for the remainder of IPL 2024.

Hasaranga was set to represent SRH for the first time in his IPL career after being bought by the 2016 champions for Rs 1.5 crore at the players’ auction last December.

However, a chronic pain in his left foot ended his hopes of playing any role for his new franchise in the ongoing season.

Hasaranga represented Royal Challengers Bengaluru for two seasons after being bought at an astronomical price of Rs 10.75 crore at the 2022 players’ auction.

The legspinner had an excellent maiden season for RCB, taking 26 wickets but played limited role last year following which he was released.
