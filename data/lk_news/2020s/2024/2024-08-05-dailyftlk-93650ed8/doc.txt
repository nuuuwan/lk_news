SLPP National Convenor Rohitha to support President

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) National Convenor Rohitha Abeygunawardena has declared his support for President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s candidacy in the upcoming elections.

Speaking at a public meeting in Kalutara yesterday, Abeygunawardena explained that his decision was made in response to the requests of party supporters.

Abeygunawardena said, despite his decision to support Wickremesinghe at this time, his loyalty to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, whom he regards as his political leader, and Basil Rajapaksa, whom he considers his political mentor, remains unwavering.

The SLPP stalwart said the decision was a difficult one and was not made in opposition to Mahinda Rajapaksa or the SLPP.

“We know that in politics, there are no permanent friends or enemies. Therefore, after listening to the people and considering the country’s situation, I have decided to support Ranil Wickremesinghe for the presidency,” he said.

Abeygunawardena assured that he would focus on securing the Kalutara vote for Wickremesinghe.
