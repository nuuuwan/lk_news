Rajitha takes pro-government stand?

Colombo, Jan  29 (Daily Mirror) -  Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Rajitha Senaratne who seemed to have taken a pro-government stand said IMF will declare Sri Lanka as a state which had come out of bankruptcy next month.

Speaking during a public meeting over the weekend, MP Senaratne said Sri Lanka is slated to become a nation which had come out of bankruptcy within the shortest time.

"People in Greece toppled four governments after it went into bankruptcy. It took ten years to come out of bankruptcy. So did Argentina and Lebanon. However, our country is slated to become the nation to come out of bankruptcy within the shortest period. IMF is likely to declare Sri Lanka as a state with a recovered economy next month," the MP said.

MP Senaratne however voted against the Online Safety Bill last week.

He said that the SJB Leader was critical of the engagement that the government has and had recently pledged that a future government led by him will go for a fresh agreement with IMF.
