NDB Bank’s sustainable bond framework receives ‘Good’ rating from Sustainable Fitch

National Development Bank PLC (NDB) has received a Second-Party Opinion (SPO) from Sustainable Fitch for its Sustainable Bond Framework (SBF), marking a significant step in NDB’s commitment to sustainable finance. The SPO, which provides an independent assessment of NDB’s framework, has rated the alignment of the bank’s sustainability bond framework as “Good” based on internationally recognised principles and guidelines set forth by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA).

The Sustainable Bond Framework enables NDB to finance or refinance projects under several green and social categories that support Sri Lanka’s national goals for environmental protection and social advancement. These include seven green use of proceeds (UoP) categories such as renewable energy, green buildings, clean transportation, and climate change adaptation, as well as four social categories, including affordable infrastructure and employment generation. Sustainable Fitch’s validation confirms that NDB’s approach to sustainability bonds aligns with key principles and guidelines of ICMA.
