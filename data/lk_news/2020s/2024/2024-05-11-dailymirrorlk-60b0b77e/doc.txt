State officials can become monks in Thailand

The government has decided to implement a referral programme for state officials to become monks in Thailand, the Buddhist Religious and Cultural Affairs Ministry said.

Accordingly, the Thailand Government has planned to implement a special temporary monastic programme for the Sri Lankan community to improve the local religious and cultural relations between the two countries in view of the birthday of the King of Thailand.

The Buddhist Religious and Cultural Affairs Ministry says that the programme will be held in Thailand for 15 days.
