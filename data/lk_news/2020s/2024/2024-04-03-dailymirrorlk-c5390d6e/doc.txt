Maithripala decides not to provide statement in court

Colombo, April 3 (Daily Mirror)- Former President Maithripala Sirisena has informed the Maligakanda Magistrate's Court that he will not provide a confidential statement before the magistrate in connection with his controversial revelation regarding the Easter Sunday attacks.

Court had earlier directed the former President to appear before Court on April 4 following a request by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID).

In a motion before Magistrate Lochani Abeywickrema, a lawyer representing former President Sirisena informed court that his client does not intend to make a confidential statement regarding the Easter Sunday attacks since he has already made a detailed statement to the CID. After hearing the submissions, the Magistrate held that there is no necessity for the former President to appear before court on April 4.

The CID had filed a facts report before Maligakanda Magistrate's Court regarding the statement the former President had made recently. Minister of Public Security Tiran Alas had instructed the Inspector General of Police to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the statement made by the former President in Kandy that he knew the people involved in the Easter Sunday bomb attacks on 21 April 2019.
