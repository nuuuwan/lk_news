SLFP to part ways with NDF

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has decided not to contest future elections under the National Democratic Front (NDF) alliance. The decision was confirmed by SLFP Treasurer Lasantha Alagiyawanna yesterday.

Speaking to the media Alagiyawanna clarified that the party’s Senior Vice President Faiszer Musthapha’s nomination to the National List was part of a pre-election agreement between the parties.

Alagiyawanna dismissed allegations of conspiracy surrounding the appointment by coalition partner, the United National Party (UNP), stating, “What plot are these people talking about? The agreement was finalised before the election, and his name was already on the National List. Where is the conspiracy in that?”

He emphasized that the SLFP has no intention of aligning with the NDF in future elections and will contest the upcoming local government elections independently, under the party’s chair symbol. He said the decision to contest solo was made during a Central Committee meeting of the SLFP this week.
