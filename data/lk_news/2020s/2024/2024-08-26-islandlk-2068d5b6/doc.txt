Sri Lankans lightning up Dubai scene

Dubai is certainly a happening scene, even where entertainment is concerned, and Sri Lankan performers are doing exceptionally well, I’m told.

The Seven Notes, made up of Sri Lankan musicians, who are based in Dubai, are much in demand and are seen in action, on a regular basis, at most of the popular venues over there.

Early this month, their renowned bassist, Niluk Uswaththa, put together an event, called ‘Madakini Chapter 2’ – a concert that featured Sri Lankan artistes, along with the band Seven Notes.

According to reports coming my way, Yenuli Neriah, who impressed many when she came on Sirasa TV’s The Voice programme, was the star at this event which showcased a broad and diverse mix of talent.

It was Yenuli who stole the show with her electrifying performance – a unique blend of contemporary pop and traditional melodies – reports coming my way indicate.

Yenuli now lives in Dubai, with her parents and two sisters, and her name has now become synonymous with musical excellence.

The Madakini concert series, known for its commitment to celebrating artistic innovation, provided the perfect platform for Yenuli to demonstrate her remarkable vocal prowess.

As the crowd gathered in anticipation, the atmosphere was charged with excitement. Dressed in a stunning outfit that reflected her dynamic personality, Yenuli opened the concert with a powerful rendition of ‘Girl On Fire’, leaving the audience in awe.

Throughout her performance, Yenuli captivated the large crown present with her ability to convey deep emotions through her music. Her stage presence was magnetic, and her connection with the audience was palpable.

Niluk Uswaththa, the mastermind behind the concert, expressed his admiration for Yenuli’s talent. “She is a breath of fresh air in the music industry. Her ability to connect with people, through her music, is truly remarkable. It was an honour to have her perform at Madakini Chapter 2,” he stated, adding that it is clear that she is poised for greater success on the international stage.

As the night progressed, Yenuli was joined on stage by a lineup of talented musicians, creating an unforgettable synergy that showcased the best of Dubai’s Sri Lankan talent.

Just in to her teen years, Yenuli Neriah already has many achievements to her credit:

* Member of the choir at the closing ceremony of Expo 2020, held in Dubai on 31 March, 2022.

* Choir member to welcome His Holiness, Pope Francis, in Abu Dhabi, 2019.

* Choir member at the 72nd International Astronautical Congress 2021, in Dubai.

* Solo performances at several shows conducted by Melodica Institute, Dubai.

Well, I guess, before long we may see her globe-trotting, as well.
