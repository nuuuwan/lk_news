Alhambra Hotels celebrates 50 years of hospitality excellence

Alhambra Hotels commemorated five decades of unwavering dedication to hospitality excellence today. What began as a visionary endeavour by founding Chairman Jabir A. Cader, a prominent businessman, has evolved into a cornerstone of Colombo’s hospitality landscape.

Originally envisioned as a modern cinema, the venture transformed with the changing tides, capitalizing on the burgeoning tourism industry generated by the ‘Tourism Development Act’ and in 1974, a pivotal partnership with the Holiday Inn group propelled Alhambra Hotels into the international spotlight, becoming the second International Hotel Chain in Sri Lanka to do so at that time.

It was also the introduction of the first-ever North Indian restaurant, Alhambra which serves up the most tantalizing and delicious Moghul Cuisine in the city to this date and is renowned for its famous Mutton Biryani, Thalis, and much more.

In 2009, Alhambra Hotels transformed into Ramada by Wyndham Colombo, marking a new era. This partnership with Wyndham Hotels brought modernization and luxury. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, a subsidiary of Wyndham Destinations since 1981, operates globally with over 9000 hotels across 95 countries.

Alhambra Hotels benefits greatly from affiliating with Wyndham brands, especially in marketing and loyalty programs like Wyndham Rewards. Sustainability is a key focus for Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, with initiatives to reduce energy consumption and support local communities.

Reminiscing about the journey so far, one of the most significant times   Managing Director Imthiaz Cader recalls is “the period of 2005 to 2009/10, when the hotel industry was going through a difficult phase.  Even though the 30-year-old civil war came to an end in 2009 May, there was low occupancy (4-stars were selling at $20 a night). There was no assistance given at that time by the government compared to what we are getting now or during the COVID-19 period. In 2006, it was one of the worst periods we have ever gone through in the economy and what we are going through now is nothing compared to that time. Today we have the occupancy and the minimum rates imposed.”

Imtiaz Cader stepped in as the third General Manager of Holiday Inn in 1977 and was also the youngest General Manager in the Far East Region for Holiday Inn.

Chairman Fahmy Cader, talks of how his father Jabir A Cader wanted him to start from the bottom and put him in charge as the Purchasing Manager (according to him, the organizer is an important position when it comes to running a profitable business) and from there on he worked his way up to Director Sales and is now serving in the Board of Directors as Chairman. Fahmy was also responsible for most of the refurbishment undertaken for Alhambra Hotels.

As Alhambra Hotels celebrates its golden jubilee, it looks toward the future with renewed optimism and a steadfast commitment to excellence. With a rich tapestry of history woven into its fabric, Ramada by Wyndham Colombo stands poised to continue its legacy of hospitality innovation for generations to come.

Adding to this, Director M. Shanthikumar, a veteran in hospitality and tourism second said “From its very inception 50 years ago, the hotel has been renowned for its hospitality and for offering a delectable culinary experience to guests from near and far. Located in the heart of Colombo city, the hotel has shown great resilience to withstand the challenges of a 3-decade civil war and many natural and manmade disasters in the country. The property stands today as a landmark hotel in Colombo patronized by holiday travellers, businessmen, and Sri Lankans.”

Beyond its architectural splendour and culinary delights, Ramada by Wyndham Colombo is a testament to the enduring values of its founder and his descendants. Known for their unwavering loyalty to employees and commitment to fostering a nurturing work environment, the Cader family has created a legacy of camaraderie and dedication that resonates throughout the hotel.

Taking the reins forward, the current General Manager Wasim Cader had the following to say about the 5 decades of Alhambra Hotels, “Alhambra Hotels has been through a challenging period of 50 years, operating during the 30-year civil war and facing various political and economic issues in the recent past. The effects of Sri Lanka’s economic crisis have caused a severe drain in manpower and we’re currently facing one of the most difficult recruitment crises we have faced in the past 50 years.”

“Our staff is our greatest asset and enduring legacy to hospitality. We meticulously cultivate them to excel in their roles, fostering strong bonds with patrons, employees, and suppliers. Generations have cherished our services, with Ramada being a favoured wedding venue for many families. Despite new international hotel brands in our city, Alhambra Hotels maintains its 50-year legacy with authentic Sri Lankan hospitality and personalized service.

“Our five decades of success stem from our steadfast commitment to high standards in all aspects of our operations, incorporating stakeholder feedback for sustained industry leadership. From its inception, we have remained at the forefront of technological advancements, outpacing even some of the most renowned five-star establishments. Our commitment to providing a world-class hospitality experience is underscored by our strategic adoption of cutting-edge technologies.

As we reflect on our journey over the past 50 years, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to all those who have contributed to our growth and success. While commemorating this significant milestone, we approach the future with optimism and excitement, aspiring to remain at the forefront of the evolving hospitality landscape and cement our position as one of the premier establishments in the country.
