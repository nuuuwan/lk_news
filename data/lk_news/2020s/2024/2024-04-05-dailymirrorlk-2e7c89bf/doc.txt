Ex-Police Officer arrested over stones pelted at hotel housing Japanese Envoyâ€™s spouse

Buttala, April 5 (Daily Mirror) - A former Chief Inspector of Police has been arrested for allegedly pelting stones at a hotel in Buttala, where the spouse of the Ambassador to Japan was staying last night.

Mariko Mizukoshi, the Ambassador's wife, informed the hotel owner in writing about the incident, prompting the hotel management to lodge a complaint with the Buttala Police.

According to Mizukoshi, she stayed at the hotel on Thursday (04) after travelling from Colombo to attend an official ceremony at the Little Tree Special Needs Children's Centre in the area.

"Somebody threw several stones toward the big window of the wedding hall last night, causing devastating damage to the hotel. As a hotel guest, I was really scared about what happened. Japanese visitors, supporters, and officials from the Japanese Government will all feel scared and anxious if such a thing happens again, as we sometimes come here and stay to visit the Little Tree," she said.

Mizukoshi said she was informed that a former Police officer named M.L.D. Ranjan, who lives next door to the hotel, had pelted the stones.

Accordingly, the suspect, identified as the former Chief Inspector, was arrested.

The Buttala Police told the Daily Mirror that the suspect will be produced before the Wellawaya Magistrate's Court.

It has been reported that the suspect was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident.
