Three cops interdicted over alleged poisoning of 2 suspects in custody

Three police officers have been interdicted in connection with the alleged poisoning of two suspects held in a cell at the Aduruppu Veediya police station. Reportedly, the duo had fallen ill after consuming a packet of milk handed to them by a visitor.

They had been arrested by the police over a recent shooting incident that took place in Jinthupitiya.

Two assailants on a motorcycle had opened fire in Jinthupitiya on January 25, leaving a youth injured. The gunman had escaped the crime scene while the bystanders captured his accomplice. The fleeing gunman was later apprehended in Dambadeniya and was brought to the Aduruppu Veediya police station for interrogation.

Later, another suspect was also taken into custody for aiding and abetting the shooting.

The apprehended gunman and the third suspect were reportedly held in the same cell at the Aduruppu Veediya police station.

The girlfriend of the gunman had visited them at the police last morning, followed by another visitor, who gave them two buns and a packet of milk.

After consuming the milk packet, both had fallen ill. Thus, they were admitted to the Colombo National Hospital for medical attention.

Police have raised suspicions that the milk packet had been contaminated with poison.

Accordingly, investigations are underway to apprehend the said visitor whose identity is yet to be determined.
