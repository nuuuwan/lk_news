Sri Lanka sees less election complaints than in previous years

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Election Commission had received 188 complaints on Monday (11) when campaigning officially ceased ahead of the Parliamentary Election on November 14.

A majority of the complaints were on election law violations, with only one incident reported of actual violence.

Total complaints received by the commission since the election was declared on September 26 was 2,999.

The number of incidents are considerably less compared to the 8,683 reported in the previous parliamentary election in  August 2022.

Historically, Sri Lanka has seen violent incidents sometimes leading to deaths, in the run-up to general elections as not just candidates from opposing parties, but also inter-party contenders vie for preference votes (manapa pora). (Colombo/Nov13/2024)
