US agency reviewing Adani Sri Lanka terminal funding: report

ECONOMYNEXT – US International Development Finance Corporation, a state agency that agreed to finance a port terminal promoted by India’s Adani group is conducting due diligence, a media report said, after bribery charges were filed against the group in America.

“We continue to conduct due diligence to ensure that all aspects of the project meet our rigorous standards before any loan disbursements are made,” Bloomberg Newswires quoted a USIDC official as saying.

“The project has not reached financial close or signed a loan agreement.”

The US DFC said it would provide up to 553 million dollars for the terminal which is a joint venture with Sri Lanka’s John Keells group, in a move seen by some analysts a counter to China’s influence in the island.

But last week the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice filed charges against the group and key officials saying Adani Green Energy had paid or was planning to pay up to 250 million dollars to get solar energy deals from India.

Funding for the projects had in part been raised from US investors. (Colombo/Nov25/2024)
