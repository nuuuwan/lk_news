Sri Lankan wanted for 1991 murder in Romania arrested in Germany

Romania , April 18 - A 53-year-old Sri Lankan man, wanted internationally for a murder committed in Bucharest in 1991, has been arrested in Germany earlier this year. He is set to be extradited to Romania on April 23 to serve a 19-year prison sentence.

According to a police press release, the man killed a foreign citizen in December 1991. He then tied up the victim, wrapped him in a carpet from his residence in Bucharest and transported him to the Crângași neighborhood, where he disposed of the body in Lake Morii. He was sentenced to 19 years in prison for this crime.

Following reports of the man's whereabouts in Germany, Romanian authorities collaborated with their German counterparts, leading to his arrest in Moers on January 3.

Upon his return to Romania, the man will be incarcerated to serve the sentence.
