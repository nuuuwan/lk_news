Court orders freezing of Keheliya Rambukwella’s family assets

The Colombo High Court yesterday issued an order to freeze 16 fixed deposit accounts and three insurance policies belonging to the family members of former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella.

The move comes following an application made by the Bribery Commission.

The total value of the frozen assets is estimated at Rs. 93.125 million.

The accounts and policies affected are under the names of Rambukwella’s spouse, three daughters and son-in-law and will remain frozen for a period of seven days.

The former Health Minister is currently held in remand custody over allegations related to the purchase of substandard immunoglobulin injections. The Bribery Commission obtained this freezing order under Section 53(1) of the Anti-Corruption Act No. 09 of 2023, as part of an ongoing investigation conducted under Section 42 of the same Act. This section allows for scrutiny of the spouse, family members, or any other associated persons in corruption cases.
