Leader Sajith Premadasa did not get an appointment from the Iranian Embassy to meet the Iranian President.

He told Parliament that Sajith Premadasa did not attend the dinner with the Iranian President hosted by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, as he never attends dinners hosted by President Wickremesinghe.

“I must correct the incorrect reports claiming that the Samagi Jana Balawegaya did not meet the Iranian President.
