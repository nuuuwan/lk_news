Dancing scene …in Melbourne

Sri Lankan musicians are generally in the news, Down Under, especially in Melbourne.

Apart from our music-makers, I hardly see the spotlight being focused on other forms of entertainment.

However, the exception, I would say is the Tiya Dance Troupe, based in Melbourne.

They have been dancing their way to success and are now much in demand when it comes to special events.

This dance troupe is from the Tiya Dance Troupe & Academy Melbourne and this institution is owned by Sri Lankans, with Tiya Baranasooriya doing the needful as dance teacher and choreographer. She also happens to be the owner.

The Academy has been around for the past nine years and conduct classes connected with Sri Lankan and Bollywood dance styles.

Says Tiya: “We were inactive for a short while due to the Covid pandemic but now we are in full swing.”

Tiya went on to say that the Tiya Dance Troupe & Academy Melbourne is only for females, adding that they conduct classes for Sri Lankan and other community groups living in Australia.

“Where our dance troupe is concerned, we work with many community groups and the Sri Lankan community…for Sri Lankan concerts and New Year festivals held in Melbourne, and interstate as well.

Tiya Dance Troupe will be seen in action on 28th September, in Melbourne, at a concert featuring Keerthi, Priyantha, Dharshi and Malith.
