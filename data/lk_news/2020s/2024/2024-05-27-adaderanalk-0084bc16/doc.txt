SLFP faction led by ex-President Maithripala relocates operations

In light of the current political situation, the faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) led by former President Maithripala Sirisena has decided to carry out the future activities of the party from a new location instead of the party headquarters.

Reportedly, this new location in Colombo will replace the SLFP headquarters on Darley Road, Colombo 10, for future political activities.

The partyâ€™s internal sources said that ongoing internal conflicts and court orders have made it impractical to convene constituency and district organizers of the party at a permanent location.

Therefore, the faction led by former President Sirisena has deemed it more appropriate to operate from a different location. The new political center will serve as a venue to convene district and constituency organizers from across the island to discuss upcoming political matters, as per sources.
