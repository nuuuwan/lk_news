Govt. approves stringent penalties for offences

The Government has decided to increase fines and prison terms associated with 68 offences outlined in the Penal Code. The decision involves a substantial increase from the earlier Rs. 100 fine for certain offences to an amount exceeding Rs. 1,000.

The Cabinet of Ministers gave its nod to a draft amendment presented by Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, paving the way for revised penalties. However, the amended fines and prison terms will not apply to offences committed before the regulations take effect.

Under the current regulations, a mere six months imprisonment or a fine of Rs. 100 can be imposed on an individual found guilty of reckless driving or riding an animal in a manner that endangers lives and property. The proposed amendments introduce a three-tier system of punishments for this offence. For the first offence, a fine ranging from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 50,000 will be imposed. A second offence may result in a fine between Rs. 30,000 and Rs. 75,000, accompanied by the suspension of the offender’s driver’s license. The third offence carries a penalty of a fine not less than Rs. 75,000 or a six-month prison term or both, with the cancellation of the driver’s license.

In addition, fines for adulterating food, drink, drugs, or medical preparations intended for sale will see a substantial increase from Rs. 100 to Rs. 100,000 under the proposed amendments. Moreover, the fine for bribery related to an election is set to rise from Rs. 500 to Rs. 1 million.

This move aims to enhance legal deterrence and ensure stricter consequences for various offences, reflecting the Government’s commitment to maintaining law and order.
