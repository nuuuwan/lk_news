Over 80-pct of Sri Lanka’s PE candidates compile expense report after EC warning

ECONOMYNEXT – More than 80 percent of the candidates who contested in Sri Lanka’s parliamentary polls have submitted their mandatory campaign income and expenditure reports before the deadline, the island nation’s Election Commission (EC) data showed.

The EC last week warned the candidates and political parties to file their expense report to explain their campaign financing before the end of November 06.

Out of the total 8,361 candidates, 88.6 percent or 7,412 have submitted their reports to the Election Commission before the deadline, the Commission said in a statement on Monday (09).

Out of a total 690 political parties and independent groups, only 71.4 percent (493) and out of 527 named national list members, 82.4 percent (434) submitted their reports, the EC said.

The EC warned of legal action for the candidates who fail to fulfil the obligation and possibly of losing their opportunity in contesting at local government or provincial council polls.

Such compiling has been made mandatory in line with the Regulation of Election Expenditure Act which has been effective for the first time in Sri Lanka this year. (Colombo/December 09/2024)
