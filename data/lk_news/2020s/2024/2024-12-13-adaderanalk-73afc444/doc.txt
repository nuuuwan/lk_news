SJB MPs sign no-confidence motion against Speaker

The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) parliamentary group, led by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, has commenced signing the Motion of No Confidence against the Speaker of Parliament, according to the SJB Media Unit.

The SJB alleges that the Speaker, both before and during his campaign for the 2024 parliamentary election, and throughout his tenure as an MP and as the Speaker, has used the title “Dr.” alongside his name.

According to the SJB, this implies he holds a B.Sc. in Chemical and Process Engineering from the University of Moratuwa and a PhD from Waseda University in Japan—qualifications he allegedly does not hold.

The party also claims that the Speaker has avoided addressing public concerns and inquiries regarding these qualifications.

The no-confidence motion has already gained support from prominent SJB members, including party leader Sajith Premadasa, General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara, Chief Opposition Whip Gayantha Karunatilake, and MPs J.C. Alawathuwala, Ajith P. Perera, Sujith Sanjaya Perera, Chathura Galappaththi, Jagath Vithana, and Harshana Rajakaruna.
