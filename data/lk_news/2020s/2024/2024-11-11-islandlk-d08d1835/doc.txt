Cherry & The Bees…

Cherrie Chamari, a Sri Lanka Living in Melbourne, Australia, has got herself a band and they operate as Cherry & The Bees.

Although Cherrie, originally from Dehiwela, is seen and heard quite often in the music scene, especially in Melbourne, her day time job keeps her busy.

“I was having a busy routine with work so couldn’t focus on my music the past few months but now things are kind of settling down and that’s the reason I decided to have my own band.”

She went on to say that Cherry & The Bees have already been booked for a New Year’s Eve event.

She did one recently with Sharmalee De Silva, who is based in Germany, called ‘Kandulu Pisala Gannam.’

According to Sharmalee, they did the song as a celebration of their friendship, in the music industry.

“Cherrie and I have performed together, on several occasions, not in Sri Lanka, but abroad.”
