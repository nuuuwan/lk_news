Rootcode, a leading global software product engineering company, marked its 10th anniversary with a grand celebration at its headquarters. This milestone event highlighted a decade of relentless growth, cutting-edge innovations, and a commitment to delivering world-class technology solutions. The celebration also included the launch of a commemorative book titled “A Decade of Building Great Technology”, which chronicles Rootcode’s evolution from its humble beginnings into a global technology leader. The book captures the company’s journey, featuring pivotal projects, strategic partnerships and its remarkable expansion into global markets.

Over the past decade, Rootcode has grown its services across Europe, partnering with prominent organisations such as the United Nations and Kendrion, a major Dutch manufacturer of electromagnetic systems. Today, Rootcode’s technological solutions power over 100 digital products, serving more than 30 industries worldwide. The company’s footprint now extends to large enterprises and governments, positioning Rootcode as a global player in sectors including agritech, healthcare, esports, e-commerce, and e-governance.

Founder and CEO of Rootcode, Alagan Mahalingam speaking at the event said, “Celebrating Rootcode’s 10th anniversary is a testament to our vision of empowering businesses by building world-class technology. Rootcode has not only made a name for itself globally but has also placed Sri Lanka on the map as a hub for innovative tech solutions. I am immensely grateful to our dedicated team and loyal clients who have been integral to our success. Rootcode’s mission has always been clear – to help businesses build transformative technology both locally and globally.”

Alagan established Rootcode in 2014 with a singular goal to build a mobile app. Over the years, the company broadened its scope, developing advanced technology products that are recognised on the global stage. From its first product, Singify, which was nominated for The Asia Pacific ICT Alliance Awards (APICTA) in 2016, to becoming the champion at The Global Hack hosted by the European Commission, Rootcode has consistently demonstrated excellence. The product from this hack, Expert Republic, became a crucial platform during the pandemic, offering professional services to users worldwide.

Rootcode’s journey of innovation and growth was further strengthened with the addition of Mangala Perera, who joined as Partner and Chief Operating Officer. With over 25 years of experience in the tech industry and previously serving as Vice President of Software Operations at IFS, Mangala’s leadership has been instrumental in steering Rootcode toward continued success.

Rootcode’s establishment of a dedicated artificial intelligence division in 2021 marked a significant milestone in the company’s history, positioning it as a pioneer in AI innovation in Sri Lanka. Shortly after, Rootcode launched Rootcode Studio, its user experience design arm, further solidifying its focus on enhancing digital products with top-tier UX design.

In 2022, Rootcode extended its vision beyond business success by launching the Rootcode Foundation, a philanthropic initiative dedicated to empowering underprivileged students through technology education. Rootcode has also fostered a thriving community of tech and AI enthusiasts through its AI Community Meetup, which has grown to over 3,500 attendees globally. These meetups have become a valuable platform for knowledge sharing, networking, and staying updated on the latest technological trends.

Rootcode’s achievements include securing a public tender from the Government of Estonia to build an artificial intelligence framework, marking its first contract with a European government. This collaboration underscores Rootcode’s growing influence in the global tech landscape.

During the anniversary celebration, the CEO of Zivi and a long-time Rootcode client, Kujtim Salihu shared his appreciation for the company’s expertise and dedication: “Since partnering with Rootcode in 2020, I have witnessed their transformation from a small startup into a global technology powerhouse. Their unwavering commitment to delivering exceptional solutions has played a significant role in our success. I trust Rootcode to be a partner in every venture I pursue, knowing they are driven by expertise and a passion for innovation.”

Rootcode’s ability to forge strong, long-lasting client relationships is a testament to its exceptional service quality. With over 100 talented employees and a customer base that spans the Nordic and North American regions, Rootcode continues to deliver impactful digital products to clients across the globe.

As Rootcode embarks on its second decade, it remains focused on advancing cutting-edge technologies, expanding its global presence, and continuing to make meaningful contributions to communities through its philanthropic efforts. Alagan Mahalingam’s vision for the future is clear – to lead the global tech industry while maintaining a deep commitment to innovation and social impact. Rootcode’s remarkable success story is a source of inspiration.
