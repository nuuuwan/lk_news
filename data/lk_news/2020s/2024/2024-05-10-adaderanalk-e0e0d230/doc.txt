Top US official to visit Sri Lanka to reaffirm support for economic recovery

U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, Donald Lu, is scheduled to visit Sri Lanka this week, as part of his broader tour of the region from May 10th to 15th, which includes India and Bangladesh.

“His trip will strengthen bilateral cooperation with each country and demonstrate U.S. support for a free, open, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region,” the US State Department said in a statement.

In Chennai, Assistant Secretary Lu will meet with Consulate personnel to bolster bilateral engagement in southern India.

He will then travel to Colombo to engage with officials from across the political spectrum and deepen the United States’ partnership with Sri Lanka.

In his meetings, he will reaffirm the United States’ support for Sri Lanka’s economic recovery, as well as the importance of a robust civil society as a cornerstone of a free and democratic society, it said.

Assistant Secretary Lu will conclude his trip in Dhaka, where he will meet with government officials, civil society leaders, and other Bangladeshis to discuss U.S.-Bangladesh cooperation, including on addressing the climate crisis and deepening economic ties.
