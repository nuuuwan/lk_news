Harin denies resignation rumours amid visa fee controversy in Cabinet

Tourism Minister Harin Fernando last night refuted claims of his resignation dismissing a circulating letter as false.

Responding to the viral resignation letter on social media, Fernando clarified that while he did express intentions in the Cabinet regarding his dissatisfaction with the decision to increase visa fees, the letter in circulation was fabricated.

“Letter circulating is not true even though I mentioned my intentions in Cabinet, of not wanting to be a part of the decision to increase any visa fees. Date of the letter is also one month ago,” he noted via ‘X’.

Fernando expressed discontent with the new visa processing system, particularly highlighting his objection to the $ 18.5 service fee charged by VFS Global. “It is not surprising that the Opposition leader wants to pin this on me rather than on the line ministry, which implemented this system while we were finalising the proposal for free visas for over 50 countries,” he noted.

Fernando also revealed when the new proposal was introduced, VFS charges were not mentioned. “Since it came to light, I have objected to the proposal,” he said.

Following deliberations among Cabinet Ministers and relevant officials, it was decided to revert to issuing a 30-day single-entry visa at an all-inclusive fee of $ 50.

“As mentioned from the beginning, from 7 May onwards a 30-day single-entry visa all inclusive at $ 50 until our proposal for free visas for more than 50 countries is finalised. Till then 7 counties will enjoy free visas as before,” the Minister stated.
