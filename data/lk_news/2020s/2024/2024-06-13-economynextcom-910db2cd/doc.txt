Sri Lanka’s Softlogic Rs10bn rights issue to settle debt

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Softlogic Holdings Plc has said funds from a 10 billion rupee rights issue would be used to settle the company’s debt.

Softlogic announced in March that it would infuse equity into the company by raising up to 2,981,358,020 rupees through a rights issue of shares and up to 1,878,255,550.50 rupees through a conversion of warrants into shares.

It said at the time this would be for the purposes of settling the Company’s debt and meeting the working capital requirement.

“The Board, on 29th May 2024, resolved to redefine the aforesaid purpose, according to which the totality of the funds raised would be employed only to settle the debt,” the company said on Wednesday in a stock exchange filing.

The company has also proposed a share buy-back subject to shareholder approval.

The group which has interests in retail, leisure, healthcare, and financial services is looking to sell down assets and cut debt, Chairman Ashok Pathirage told shareholders in November last year. (Colombo/Jun13/2024)
