Health sector trade unions call off strike

The ongoing trade union action launched by the health sector workers has been called off.

The trade unions affiliated with the Health Trade Union Alliance were planning to resort to an indefinite strike tomorrow (03) after the discussion that was originally scheduled to be held on Monday with the ministerial authorities was deferred to this evening.

However, as the meeting convened at the Presidential Secretariat earlier today ended on a positive note, the health sector trade unions arrived at a decision to call off the planned indefinite strike action.

The health workers expanded their token strike launched on Monday (01) at five state hospitals. As such, they engaged in a 4-hour strike at 10 selected state hospitals starting at 6.30 a.m. today (02).
