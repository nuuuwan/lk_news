Perahera elephant goes on rampage in Mawanella town

An elephant has reportedly gone on a rampage at the end of a ‘Vesak Perahera’ held in the Mawanella town tonight while a mahout has been critically injured and hospitalised after being attacked by the tusker.

The mahout, who was critically injured in the attack by the rampaging elephant, has been admitted to the Mawanella Base Hospital.

Ada Derana reporter said that the elephant in question, “Raja” belongs to the fleet of tuskers of the Sri Dalada Maligawa, Kandy.

The incident had reportedly occurred at around 8.00 p.m. tonight at the end of the Perahera (procession).

Ada Derana reporter said that the elephant was later seen marching down the streets of the Mawanella town in a panic, and has now been kept under special security at the market grounds.
