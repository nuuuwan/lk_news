Keheliya, ex-Health Secretary and 5 others further remanded

Former Minister of Health Keheliya Rambukwella, former Health Secretary Janaka Chandragupta and five others have been ordered to be further remanded until February 29, over the import of substandard human Immunoglobulin vials.

This order was issued when the case was taken up before the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court today (15), Ada Derana reporter said.

However, the former Health Minister did not appear before the court today owing to medical reasons, and the Prison Commissioner and Spokesperson Gamini B. Dissanayake had confirmed that the parliamentarian was unable to attend court proceedings due to him being ill.

Meanwhile, President’s Counsel Anuja Premaratne, who appeared on behalf of Rambukwella, stated before the court that his client is suffering from a specific respiratory disorder which leads to sleep apnea. The President’s Counsel also claimed that oxygen should be provided to Rambukwella in such a case.

Claiming that necessary treatment for the relevant medical condition cannot be facilitated within the prison, the attorney also requested the court to release the former Health Minister on bail. He also presented a diagram indicating the position in which a person suffering from the said medical condition is required to sleep.

However, the Maligakanda Magistrate stated that if any suspect suffers from specific medical conditions, they must submit acceptable medical reports to the court and mentioned that pictures obtained from the internet which were presented to the court are not admissible evidence.

Therefore, the magistrate who rejected the bail request, ordered all seven suspects in the case, including the former Health Minister and the former Health Secretary, to be further remanded until February 29.
