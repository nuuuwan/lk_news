Sri Lanka to remunerate overnight excess reserves daily from April 01

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank said it will remove restrictions on paying interest on overnight cash balances of banks through its standing deposit facility (SDF) from April 01.

The standing deposit facility forms a lower policy rate corridor by preventing short-term rates from falling close to zero when dollars a purchased during a balance of payments surplus generated from reduced domestic credit.

“Banks were only given the opportunity to go the standing deposit facility 10 times,” Governor Weerasinghe told reporter in Colombo in Sinhalese.

“With the removal of the restrictions, we expect short term rates to be determined by the market to become normal and improve transmission of monetary policy to be easier.”

During the last currency crisis and external default, several risk averse banks deposited large volume of money in the SDF window instead of lending in the interbank bank due to risk perceptions or buying government bonds as happened during earlier crises.

The liquidity preference behaviour of market participants (a type of private sector sterilization) tends to push up bond yields due to the unwillingness to buy bonds and also reduce private credit.

Sri Lanka’s bond yields soared closed to 30 percent due to concerns over a deliberate default (re-structuring).

Officials however conducted a restricted default of pension funds and central bank held securities and bond and bill yields are coming down. (Colombo/Mar27/2024)
