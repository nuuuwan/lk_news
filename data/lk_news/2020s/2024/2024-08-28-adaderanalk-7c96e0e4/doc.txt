Massive forest fire engulfs over 20 acres of Nettamaluwa reserve

A major fire has broken out in the Nettamaluwa mountain reserve, located within the Wellawaya Divisional Secretariat Division, rapidly spreading and consuming more than 20 acres of the protected forest area.

The blaze had reportedly started last afternoon (27), and has spread rapidly during the night due to the dry weather and strong winds in the area, intensifying the destruction in one of the reserveâ€™s most sensitive ecosystems.

While firefighting teams managed to bring the fire largely under control by this morning (August 28), Ada Derana reporter said that some areas of the reserve are still experiencing active flames.
