Sri Lanka energy minister commends colleagues who lost their seat

ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka Power & Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara has spoken favourably of his cabinet colleagues Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakkara who lost their positions and seats in parliament following a Supreme Court verdict.

“Both Fernando and Nanayakkara extended their support to President Ranil Wickremesinghe at a very critical time of the country. They both put their political careers on the line knowing this outcome in the hour of need,” Wijesekara tweeted hours after a verdict delivered Friday August 09 morning.

Sri Lanka’s Supreme Court has upheld the expulsion of Manusha Nanayakkara and Harin Fernando from the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), lawyers said. Fernando and Nanayakkara  went to court against the decision by the SJB to expel them. A three judge bench, delivered the decision.

“No one can take away the work both did towards the recovery of the economy and the country. Tourism and Foreign Employment earnings and numbers speaks volumes of their hard work in the last two years,” said Wijesekara.

“Before they joined the Government I have had many political battles on different political and policy views and opinions with the both of them,” he added.

Wijesekara and then Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage debated Fernando and Nanayakkara on a live televised debate on the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings in February 2022.

“Not many would have put their political careers and their Parliament membership on the line for the country’s national agenda. They put the country before their political party. Thank you Harin and Manusha,” he said. (Colombo/Aug09/2024)
