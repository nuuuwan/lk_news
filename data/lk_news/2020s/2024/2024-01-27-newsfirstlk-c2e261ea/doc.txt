Drug Traffickers Pose Challenge in Sri Lanka’s Rehabilitation Efforts

COLOMBO (News 1st);  Sri Lanka's rehabilitation initiative faces a new obstacle, as authorities discover drug traffickers and criminals mingling among those referred for addiction treatment.

Retired Major General Darshana Hettiarachchi who is the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation confirmed that stricter procedures will be implemented to filter individuals entering rehabilitation programs.

Following the "Yukthiya Operation" that commenced in December 2023, over 300 individuals were sent for rehabilitation.

However, intelligence revealed the presence of non-addicts, including drug traffickers and criminals, within the group.

In response, Hettiarachchi announced a shift in strategy noting that moving forward not every person referred by the courts or police will be automatically admitted to rehabilitation.

He said that officials will prioritize those with genuine addiction problems.

This development comes amidst heightened tensions at the Kankakadu Treatment Rehabilitation Center.

Multiple escape attempts have occurred in recent months, the most recent on January 24th, involving 47 individuals.

Of these, 34 were recaptured and remanded, but 13 remain at large. Security at the center has been reinforced to prevent further incidents.
