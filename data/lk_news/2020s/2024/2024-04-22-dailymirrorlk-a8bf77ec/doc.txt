Indian cricket manager indicted for Legend Cricket League match-fixing allegations

Colombo, April 22 (Daily Mirror)- The Attorney General’s Department informed court today that an indictment has been filed before the Colombo High Court against an Indian cricket manager over match-fixing allegations during the Legend Cricket League 2024.

A Senior State Counsel appearing on behalf of the Attorney General made this revelation when the magisterial inquiry into the alleged match fixing case was taken up before the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court.

Court was informed that an indictment has been filed before the Colombo High Court against Yoni Patel, a team manager of the Legend Cricket League 2024.

The Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court had earlier issued an order preventing Yoni Patel and P. Akash, two team managers of the Legend Cricket League from leaving the country over match fixing allegations.

The Legend Cricket League tournament, featuring seven teams comprising retired international cricketers, was held in March at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium.

The magisterial inquiry commenced on a complaint made by former Sri Lankan cricketer Upul Tharanga who represents the Kandy Samp Army team and New Zealand legend Neil Broom representing the Punjab Royals, alleging that they were pressurised into engaging in match fixing deals.

The Legend Cricket League 2024 was held at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium in Kandy from March 8 to March 19.
