At least 10 parcels containing narcotics including ‘Kush’ cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy pills have been detected at the Central Mail Exchange, during the inspections carried out by officers of the Narcotics Control Unit of Sri Lanka Customs.

Sri Lankan Customs spokesman said the parcels in question had been sent from Canada, UK and Netherlands to addresses in Dehiwala, Wellawatta, Veyangoda and Anuradhapura.

The seized drugs will be handed over to the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) for onward legal proceedings, Sri Lanka Customs said.
