Businessman arrested after illegally assembled luxury vehicle seized in Tangalle

A luxury vehicle valued at around Rs. 30 million and suspected to have been illegally assembled has been seized by the Matara Division Criminal Investigation Unit (CIU) after being found hidden at a residence in the Vitharandeniya area of the Tangalle Police Division.

One suspect has been arrested in connection with the incident.

Based on a tip-off received regarding a suspicious vehicle hidden in the house, officers from the Matara Division Criminal Investigation Unit had searched the residence in Vitharandeniya last afternoon (12) and discovered the Toyota Land Cruiser.

The current owner had failed to provide any documentation verifying the jeep’s registration.

Accordingly, a businessman from the Pallegama area in Embilipitiya, who is considered to be its owner, has surrendered to Matara Police through an attorney.

He was later arrested and the suspect is to be produced before the Walasmulla Magistrate’s Court.

The current owner of the vehicle is said to have purchased it from a car dealership in the Kandy area.

An analytical report from the Government Analyst’s Department is to be obtained on the vehicle.
