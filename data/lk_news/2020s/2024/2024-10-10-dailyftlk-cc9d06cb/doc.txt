Cabinet decides to terminate services of contract-based officers and consultants

The Cabinet of Ministers at their meeting on Monday approved terminating the services of officers and consultants appointed on contract basis, effective from 30 September 2024.

These contract-based appointments were originally made to establish two key entities – the ‘Office for the Affairs of Sri Lankans Abroad’ under the President’s Office and the ‘National Peoples Council’ which was set up to enhance public participation in democracy alongside the implementation of the ‘Agriculture Modernisation Program’. “The Government now believes that the functions anticipated from these offices and programs can be successfully carried out by the respective Ministries and Provincial Councils. Therefore, it was decided to discontinue the contract-based appointments,” Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Vijitha Herath said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing on Tuesday.
