SajithPremadasa named Prime Ministerial candidate for SJS in upcoming election

Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa was officially named yesterday as the Prime Ministerial candidate for the Samagi Jana Sandanata (SJS) in the upcoming General Election.

The decision was unanimously approved during a party meeting, cementing his leadership role within the coalition as it prepares to challenge for Parliamentary control.

Speaking to the media following the meeting, he vehemently denied any collaboration with the former President Ranil Wickremesinghe, clarifying that there is no alliance between them.

As the SJS gears up for the next election, Premadasa took the opportunity to thank his supporters for their unwavering commitment during the recently concluded Presidential election where he was defeated by National People’s Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

“Thank you for believing in me and I promise I will not stop fighting for the future we all deserve,” Premadasa said.

In a heartfelt message he expressed gratitude for the support he received from diverse communities across the country, including Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims and Burgher.

“Whether you belong to the Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim, Burgher, or any other community and regardless of the political ideology you subscribe to, I have felt your hopes, and I carry them with me,” Premadasa said, reaffirming his dedication to building a united and prosperous country.

Despite his electoral defeat, Premadasa remains committed to his vision for Sri Lanka’s future.

“I remain as dedicated as ever to the dream of a united and prosperous Sri Lanka, where every child is given the chance to flourish, where every community feels like they belong, and where every heart is at peace,” he said
