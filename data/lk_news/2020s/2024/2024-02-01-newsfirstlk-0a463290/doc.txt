Sri Lanka, Maldives Partner for Air Ambulance Service

COLOMBO (News 1st); Air ambulance services will commence between the Maldives and Sri Lanka starting March 1, 2024.

The decision, announced by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation Services, prioritizes the high-quality emergency care available in Sri Lankan hospitals for Maldivian citizens.

Previously, Maldivians requiring urgent medical attention were transported to India.

However, recognizing the advanced medical facilities and expertise in Sri Lanka, the Maldivian government has opted for a shift in emergency medical evacuation protocols.

Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva confirmed that all necessary approvals have been granted to the Airport and Aviation Services and Civil Aviation Authority for the smooth operation of the air ambulance service.
