Sri Lanka anticipates profitable, self-sustaining postal service by end 2024

ECONOMYNEXT — A 4 billion-rupee increase in projected revenue for 2023 and a halving of losses year-on-year for Sri Lanka’s Postal Department has prompted the government to declare the state-run service will be profitable and self-sustaining by end 2024.

A revenue projection for Sri Lanka’s state-run Postal Department’s has seen an increase from 9,268 million rupees in 2022 to 13,616 million in 2023, according to State Minister for Mass Media Shantha Bandara.

Bandara told reporters on Tuesday February 13 that the department’s losses have been reduced from 7,173 million rupees in 2021 to 6,832 million in 2022 and to 3,222 million in 2023.

He attributed this to “improved services and enhanced management practices without imposing additional burdens on the public”.

“We are confident that by December 31, 2024, the Postal Department will operate as a self-sustaining, profit-making institution independent of treasury funds,” he said.

The cabinet of ministers has also approved a 10 billion-rupee project to establish a joint venture between the private and public sectors to expedite international goods exchange processes.

Plans are also underway to launch a courier service for goods exchange in the Western Province this year, utilising 200 three-wheelers and 50 motorcycles, he said.

Other plans include a project to expand the scope of services provided by Bank of Ceylon branches to cover 100 post offices.

The state minister said these plans were part of Media Ministry’s efforts to address revenue and expenditure issues.

“In tackling today’s prominent challenge of financial management, we directed our attention towards addressing revenue and expenditure issues. Specifically, we concentrated on the 16 institutions falling under the Ministry, a significant portion of which relied on Treasury allocations. As a result, initiatives were undertaken to enhance the self-sufficiency of these entities, enabling them to operate independently,” he said.

In July last year there was talk of a new Postal Act to replace Sri Lanka’s postal ordinance that dates back to the British colonial period, which State Minister Bandara said at the timewas a hindrance to reform.

This bill has yet to be presented to parliament. (Colombo/Feb14/2024)
