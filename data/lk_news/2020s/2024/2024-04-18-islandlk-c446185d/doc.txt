Gently massage the mask into your skin, using circular motions. This helps the enzymes in the papaya to penetrate.Once you have done the needful, relax and let the mask sit on your skin for 15-20 minutes. This allows the ingredients to work their magic.

After 15-20 minutes, rinse the mask off with cool water. You can also use a soft washcloth to gently remove the mask in circular motions.Pat your skin dry with a clean towel. Follow up with your favourite moisturizer to lock in hydration.

Both papaya and honey are loaded with antioxidants that protect the skin from free radical damage, which can contribute to premature aging.The enzymes and properties in papaya and honey have a soothing effect on the skin, making this mask suitable for sensitive or irritated skin types.Regular use of this mask can result in a natural, healthy glow as it improves skin health and vitality.
