Navy seized Rs. 1.6 BILLION worth of Heroin in major drug bust on High Seas

COLOMBO (News 1st); The Sri Lanka Navy seized over 65kg of heroin and apprehended 11 suspects during a special operation conducted about 100 nautical miles off Dondra Head, in southern Sri Lankan waters.

The operation, carried out on January 19th, also led to the seizure of two fishing trawlers suspected of being involved in the smuggling racket.

The operation was a joint effort by the Sri Lanka Navy and Police Narcotics Bureau, along with intelligence services. Acting on a tip, a naval ship intercepted a suspicious local fishing trawler in southern waters. A subsequent search of the vessel led to the discovery of three sacks stuffed with heroin weighing over 65kg. Five suspects were arrested onboard the drug-carrying trawler.

In addition to the main haul, the Navy also seized another multi-day fishing trawler and six suspects onboard, who are suspected of being part of the same smuggling ring. All 11 suspects, the two fishing trawlers, and the seized heroin were brought to Galle Harbour on January 20th for further legal proceedings.

The street value of the seized heroin is estimated to be over Rs. 1.6 billion, making this one of the largest drug busts in Sri Lanka's recent history. The apprehended suspects, ranging in age from 28 to 52, hail from the Matara, Gandara, and Dondra areas.

The Sri Lanka Navy has been playing a pivotal role in the fight against drug trafficking under the leadership of Commander of the Navy, Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera, who also chairs the Presidential Task Force to Combat the Use of Poisonous and Dangerous Drugs. In January alone, the Navy has successfully seized heroin and crystal methamphetamine valued at over Rs. 4.8 billion.
