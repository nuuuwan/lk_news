Easter attacks: NPP vows to properly institute legal action under its govt.

The National Peopleâ€™s Power (NPP) says that, under its administration, proper legal action will be instituted against those implicated, either directly or indirectly, in the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks that killed more than 250 people and injured hundreds of others.

This promise comes days ahead of the fifth anniversary of the coordinated suicide bombings which falls on April 21.

In a statement, the NPP highlighted that the government has an obligation towards the victims of this heinous act while raising questions as to whether this has been properly fulfilled.

The party also presented a 7-point action plan that it intends to implement under a future NPP government to serve justice to the Easter attack victims.
