UNFPA and Japan partner to enhance healthcare access

Colombo, May 06 -Â In a collaborative effort to bolster healthcare accessibility, UNFPA Sri Lanka, with financial backing from the Government of Japan, orchestrated the official handover of three "Health on Wheels" trucks to the Ministry of Health.

The ceremony, presided over by H.E. MIZUKOSHI, Ambassador of Japan, signifies a significant stride towards ensuring uninterrupted maternal and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services for at-risk communities in the Uva, Central, and Southern provinces.

These mobile health units, valued at USD 380,000, are equipped with cutting-edge facilities and designed to traverse challenging terrains, addressing the critical need for healthcare access in remote regions.

Dr. Palitha Maheepala, Secretary of the Ministry of Health, emphasized the transformative impact of this initiative, highlighting its role in bridging the gap between healthcare and underserved populations.

The Japanese Ambassador, HE Mizukoshi Hideaki, underscored Japan's commitment to supporting women's health initiatives globally and reiterated Japan's dedication to advancing the well-being of Sri Lankan women and girls.

Kunle Adeniyi, UNFPA Representative in Sri Lanka, expressed optimism about the project's potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, particularly in areas where infrastructure limitations pose significant challenges. These mobile clinics symbolize more than just convenience; they represent a lifeline for communities where access to essential healthcare services remains a pressing concern.
