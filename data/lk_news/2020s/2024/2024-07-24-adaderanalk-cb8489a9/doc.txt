Gazette increasing daily wage of plantation workers cancelled

The Labour Ministry has issued a new Gazette cancelling the previous Gazette notification which had been issued increasing the daily wage of plantation workers to Rs. 1,700.

Meanwhile, the new Gazette has been issued directing the payments to be made through the Wages Board.

The Minister of Labor had previously issued a Gazette notification setting the minimum daily wage of a plantation worker at Rs. 1,350, together with an allowance of Rs. 300 and another allowance of Rs. 80.

However, 21 plantation companies including Agarapatana Plantations Ltd., had filed a petition seeking a writ order invalidating the gazette notification issued by the Minister of Labor stipulating a minimum daily wage for plantation workers.
