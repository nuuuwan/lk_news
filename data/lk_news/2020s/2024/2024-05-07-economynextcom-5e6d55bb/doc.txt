China to support digital classroom project in Sri Lanka

ECONOMYNEXT â€“ Sri Lanka has approved a project proposal to implement digitalization in schools, with funding from the Chinese government, a government statement said.

The project is expected to provide smart boards for delivering class rooms, receiving class rooms, a data centre to monitor these activities from the Ministry of Education, and studio and conference rooms.

The project will see a hybrid learning method (learning via online, electronic media and face-to-face) implemented.

The sharing of resources are expected to mitigate risks associated with teacher shortages.

A feasibility study has been conducted on the implementation of the project. Cabinet approved the proposal presented by the Minister of Education to implement the project based on the feasibility study report. (Colombo/May7/20204)
