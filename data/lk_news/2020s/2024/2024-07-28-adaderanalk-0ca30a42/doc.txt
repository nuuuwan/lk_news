RDA Chairman resigns citing ‘excessive interference’

The Chairman of the Road Development Authority (RDA), C.P. Athaluwage has resigned from his position citing ‘excessive interference’ from the Ministry as the primary reason for his decision.

He stated that the letter of resignation had been directed to the President’s Secretary and he had further informed in this regard to Minister of Transport Bandula Gunawardena.

In his resignation letter, Athaluwage emphasized that persistent interference from the Secretary of the Ministry of Transport and Highways had significantly impacted the RDA’s administrative activities.

Athaluwage noted in his resignation letter that such interference had been a recurring issue, with direct influence being exerted on the RDA’s operations. He highlighted that, over the past four and a half years, he had worked transparently with the approval of the Board of Directors, maintaining the RDA’s reputation and striving for the betterment of its employees.

Despite his efforts to uphold the RDA’s integrity, Athaluwage expressed his unwillingness to continue under an official who engages in arbitrary actions. Consequently, he stated that he decided to step down from his post as Chairman, effective from yesterday (27).
