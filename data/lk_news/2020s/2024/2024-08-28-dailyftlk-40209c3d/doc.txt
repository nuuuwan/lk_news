New law to protect rights of indigenous community

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved directing the Legal Draftsman to prepare a draft bill based on the revised fundamental draft for introducing new legislation concerning the rights of Sri Lanka’s indigenous community.

On 22 May, the Cabinet approved the joint proposal furnished by the then Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms Minister and the Buddha Sasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs Minister in relation to introduction of the new law.

“At that meeting, it was decided that it was appropriate to further analyse the concept paper furnished to prepare the draft bill with the participation of all parties concerned,” Buddha Sasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs Minister Vidura Wickramanayaka said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

He said now the relevant fundamental draft bill has been further improved subsequent to several rounds of discussions with the participation of officers in the Ministries of Lands, Wildlife and Forest Conservation, Environment as well as Finance along with the officers of the Attorney General’s Department, the Department of Legal Draftsman and with the participation of stakeholders interested in the relevant sector headed by the Secretary to the Prime Minister.
