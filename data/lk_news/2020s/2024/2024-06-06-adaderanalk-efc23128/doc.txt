Uncertainty looms over proposed Anura–Sajith economic debate

Leader of National People’s Power Anura Kumara Dissanayake is ready for the proposed debate on economic policies, with the Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, at any time today (06), the NPP executive committee member Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said.

Dr. Jayatissa noted that the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) is yet to respond regarding the debate. He also stated that the NPP does not intend to hold the debate between party leaders after today.

Commenting regarding the matter, SJB MP Nalin Bandara stated that their party is prepared for the debate until a Presidential Election is declared.

Both parties had previously agreed to hold the debate between their leaders on June 6, from the dates proposed by the SJB.
