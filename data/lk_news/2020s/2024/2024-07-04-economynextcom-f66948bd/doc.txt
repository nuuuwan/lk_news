China minister discusses cooperation with Customs, increasing exports

ECONOMYNEXT – China’s Vice Minister of General Administration of Customs Wang Lingjun has met Sri Lankan officials to discuss cooperation with Sri Lanka Customs and the export of agricultural crops.

“We noted China’s readiness to cooperate with the Sri Lanka Customs Department in developing enhanced security and cooperation measures,” State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe said on X (twitter) after meeting Lingjun at the Sri Lanka Customs Headquarters in Colombo.

Lingjun also met Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries Mahinda Amaraweera to discuss expanding exports of tea, coconut, pineapple and spices, as well as fisheries products.

The Chinese minister “stated that the Chinese government is ready to further expand the existing opportunities for importing agricultural crops produced in Sri Lanka to the Chinese market”, Amaraweera said on Meta (Facebook).

Amaraweera said Sri Lanka’s agricultural exports to China in 2023 was 3.3 billion dollars.

Sri Lankan products account for 36 percent in the Chinese market currently, and this could be further expanded, Lingjun was quoted as saying.

He said the Chinese government will “Buy any quantity of high quality vegetables and fruits produced in Sri Lanka in the future after bilateral discussions.”

In 2021, a row over a Chinese ship carrying organic fertilizer to Sri Lanka said to be contaminated with harmful bacteria led to the blacklisting of a local state bank, and the souring of relations between the two countries.
