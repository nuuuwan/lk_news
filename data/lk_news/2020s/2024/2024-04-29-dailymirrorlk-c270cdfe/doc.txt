Colombo, April 29 (Daily Mirror)- The deadline for the Children of Gaza Fund, initiated by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to aid those affected by conflicts in Gaza, has now been extended till May 31, 2024, the Presidentâ€™s Media Division (PMD) said.

Originally scheduled to conclude on April 30, 2024, the extension follows a widespread appeal from across the island.
