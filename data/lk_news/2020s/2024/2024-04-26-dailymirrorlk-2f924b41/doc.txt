US$ 3 Million grant to strengthen inland fisheries

Colombo, April 26 (Daily Mirror) - A US$ 3 million grant from the Japanese government, through the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), in partnership with the Ministry of Fisheries, is set to boost the country’s inland fisheries sector.

A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed on Thursday, with the project aiming to directly support approximately 3,000 inland fishers, 40 farmers engaged in mini hatchery operations, and 20 farmers specializing in fish feed preparation.

The project is also expected to have a positive ripple effect on indirect beneficiaries, including family members, consumers, producers of dry fish, and stakeholders in research and academia.

Minister of Fisheries Douglas Devananda indicated that the grant would revitalize a sector that had been affected by the country’s economic crisis.

"Sri Lanka's inland fisheries sector has historically been supported by the government, contributing significantly to the nation's economy. However, recent financial challenges have left the sector deprived of necessary resources, exacerbating hardships among inland fishing communities and rural populations. This project is a pivotal step towards revitalizing the sector and ensuring sustainable benefits for all stakeholders involved,” the Minister said.

The project will see the establishment of four community operated mini hatcheries in Batticaloa, Mullaitivu, Anuradhapura and Monaragala districts, the upgrade of four NAQDA Aquaculture Development Centres and one community operated mini fish breeding centre to increase breeding and rearing capacity.

The project will also look to enhance fingerling stocks in selected reservoirs, develop brood stock for breeding units and promote cage culture for seed rearing among fisher communities.

Furthermore, the one-year project will also provide three live fish transportation trucks to NAQDA to transport fingerlings, integrate digital technology to inland fisheries, and enhance the technical capacities of officers and fishers in the production, management, processing and value addition of inland fisheries.

Japanese Ambassador Hideaki Mizukoshi said his country recognized the shared significance of the fisheries sector countries towards the respective economies and cultures of the two nations.

“Recognizing this shared significance, Japan has been steadfast in its commitment to supporting Sri Lanka's fisheries development, particularly in the maritime domain, since 2023. With the initiation of this new project alongside our continued efforts, Japan is committed to strengthening Sri Lanka's fisheries sector, thereby improving food security and livelihoods,” Ambassador Mizukoshi stated.
