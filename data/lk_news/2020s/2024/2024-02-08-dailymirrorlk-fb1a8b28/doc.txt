Opposition alleges move to postpone Presidential Election

Colombo, Feb 08 (Daily Mirror) - There is a sinister move by the government to avoid holding the Presidential election in the guise of abolishing the Executive Presidency, Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella told Parliament yesterday.

"The move is to abolish the Executive Presidency and buy time for it. The plan actually is to ask for a year to change the constitution," Kiriella said.

"We would request the government to at least hold local government polls. People want an election," he said.

"The entire opposition will take to the streets if the Presidential election is postponed, " he also said.
