Sri Lanka’s Windforce commissions 389kWp solar power project in Zanzibar

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s WindForce Plc said it has commissioned a 389kWp ground mount off-grid solar power project in Zanzibar.

“This “demonstrates our commitment to advancing renewable energy solutions, promoting sustainable development, and reducing our carbon footprint,” the company said in a stock exchange filing.

The entire project involved the engineering design, procurement, installation, testing, and commissioning of a 389kWp ground mount off-grid solar power project in Zanzibar.

The project was initially announced on November 9, 2023, and was completed on July 15, with an extended timeline due to delays in development of the required infrastructure from the client’s end, Windforce said.

WindForce has a total of 12 solar plants across the globe, located in Pakistan, Uganda and Ukraine.

In May, Fitch Ratings Lanka Ltd assigned a ‘BBB+(lka)’ rating for the company with stable outlook.(Colombo/Jul23/2024)
