Health trade unions decide to continue strike action

The collective of health sector trade unions has decided to continue their island-wide strike throughout Friday (02 Feb.) as well, Convenor of the Health Service Trade Unions Ravi Kumudesh revealed.

Kumudesh explained that the decision was taken on account of not receiving a favourable response from the government with regard to their demands.

A collective of 72 trade unions from the health sector launched a one-day strike across the country this morning (01 Feb.), urging the government to address their issues without delay.

The doctors’ unions and the All Ceylon Nurses’ Union, however, decided to refrain from joining the strike action, alleging that the planned strike action was a conspiracy by the government.
