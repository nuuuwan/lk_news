Heated argument in Parliament over Divisional Secretary

A heated exchange erupted in Parliament on a while ago regarding the suspension and subsequent reinstatement of Udapalatha Divisional Secretary Gampala Athma Dilruskshi.

State Minister Anuradha Jayaratne, Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella, and Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana were all involved in the contentious debate.

State Minister Jayaratne raised concerns regarding the Divisional Secretary's transfer, claiming she had failed to pay a contractor for construction work in Udapalatha, instead directing Rs. 1.6 million to a third party.

He said she had posted a notice falsely claiming her removal from the National Heritage Association, which he claimed was founded by his father but did not involve him personally.

He said that there could be a sinister move to sling mud at him claiming I got her transferred, he said.

Responding to the accusations, Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella highlighted the Public Services Commission's clearance of all charges against the Divisional Secretary, leading to her reinstatement.

â€œThe Public Services Commission had reinstated the Divisional Secretary. This means that the Commission considered her innocent. Justice has to be meted out to the Divisional Secretary on that score," he said.

The State Minister countered swiftly saying that MP Kiriella is defending the Divisional Secretary because her husband is an active member of Samagi Jana Balawegaya and had been nominated for the Kandy Municipal Council.

This ignited further argument, drawing in Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana also in, who was also seen engaged in a heated exchange with MP Kiriella.
