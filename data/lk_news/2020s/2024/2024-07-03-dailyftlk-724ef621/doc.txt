SL to ink deal with Swiss Govt. for second phase of Global Textile and Apparel Program

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved a proposal to enter into a project agreement with the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) to implement the second phase of the Global Textile and Apparel Program.

The agreement, set to be signed by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB), will provide significant support from SECO’s Global Textiles and Apparels Program. This support is expected to drive the industry’s shift towards sustainable practices and enhance its competitive edge in the global market by integrating advanced digital technologies.

“The initiative aims to support the transformation of Sri Lanka’s textile and apparel industry towards producing quality green products through the promotion of digitisation,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

He said the collaboration marks a significant step towards achieving a more sustainable and digitally advanced textile and apparel industry in Sri Lanka.

The proposal to this effect submitted by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as the Investment Promotion Minister was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
