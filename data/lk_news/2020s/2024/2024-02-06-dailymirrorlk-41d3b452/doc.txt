Change name of ’Keheliya Rambukwella Primary School’: CTU

Colombo, Feb 6 (Daily Mirror) - While going against the circular issued by the Education Ministry, a school 'Keheliya Rambukwella Primary School' had been named in Kundasale in Kandy by the name of former Environment Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, and this name should be removed, Ceylon Teachers' Union (CTU) general secretary Joseph Stalin said.

Addressing the media, he said the Education Ministry had issued a circular in 1996 stating that a school cannot be named after a person who is still alive.

Even though Keheliya Rambukwella had been arrested and remanded over the controversial human immunoglobulin procurement scandal, it is not relavant to keep his name for the said school, he said.

Keheliya had set the wrong example to society, and he had been imprisoned. Therefore, it is not acceptable to name a school after him, he charged.

The CTU questioned the Education Ministry, as they still want to keep Keheliya's name for the school. Keeping a school name for those found guilty will not help provide an example to the school.

The same controversy had emerged when naming schools after 'Mahinda Rajapaksa'. Minister Bandula Gunawardana was the person who started naming those schools during the Rajapaksa regime, Stalin said.

"Therefore, the CTU demands the government to take immediate action against naming schools after persons who are still alive," he added.
