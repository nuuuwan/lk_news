Sri Lanka to expand SME according to state plan: President

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s small and medium enterprises will be expanded according to the requirement of a plan developed by the state, President Anura Dissanayake said.

“The small and medium enterprises is not a sector that works according to its own wants and according to its own decisions,” President Dissanayake said delivering a statement to the parliament.
