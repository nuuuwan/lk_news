Sri Lanka reports over 5,000 Leptospirosis cases so far in 2024

The Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health says that 5,000 Leptospirosis cases have been reported within the first six months of the year.

Health officials advise the public to promptly seek medical advice if they experience a fever or exhibit symptoms related to rat fever.

The bacteria responsible for this disease is mainly found in rat urine and it has also been detected in the feces and urine of cattle, dogs and pigs.

Commenting on this regard, Consultant Epidemiologist Dr. Thushani Dabarera stated that around 100 fatalities are reported annually due to rat fever.

Dr. Dabarera also stated that most of the time individuals who do not seek immediate treatment succumb to this disease. However, she emphasised that medicines are available for rat fever and that the disease can be effectively cured.

She further stated that individuals with cuts or other injuries are more susceptible to rat fever and mentioned that the bacteria can also enter the body by coming into contact with contaminated water when washing the face, mouth or nose.

The risk of contracting rat fever is particularly high among farmers, gem miners and workers who engage in cleaning waste or drainages while cases are frequently reported in districts such as Ratnapura, Galle, Kegalle, Matara, Kalutara, Monaragala and Kurunegala.

Consultant Physician in internal medicine at the Colombo North Teaching Hospital (CNTH), Dr. Kolitha Jayasundara, advises to immediately seek medical attention upon experiencing symptoms such as high fever, redness of eyes, abdominal pain, coughing, or skin spots, especially accompanied by severe muscle pain or headache and emphasised that itâ€™s essential to consult a doctor immediately.
