PM pledges support for new political movement by MPs and parties backing President Ranil

Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena says that the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MPs and political parties who came forward to support Ranil Wickremesinghe in the Presidential Election are holding discussions to create a new political movement.

The Prime Minister made these comments while speaking to the media after visiting Maha Nayaka Theros of Malwathu and Asgiri chapters in Kandy, the Prime Minister’s Media Division said in a statement.

The Prime Minister also mentioned that he will always give his blessing and support as the Prime Minister to build the said political movement.

The Prime Minister further commented: “The overwhelming majority of SLPP MPs who supported the government to move forward, decided to support Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe who recovered the country from the crisis, in the Presidential Election.”

“Those MPs represent many other parties as well as SLPP”, he added.

“The country, which has come forward with great difficulty during last two years, is currently moving on the right path. We are all working together to further protect and advance this victory. At this moment, all the members from the local government to the parliament are joining hands.”

“No one should be afraid that they will not be able to get candidacy in the next election because of this”, said the PM.

“We will not allow any threat to them. We have understood the need to create a new political movement. For that, I will give my utmost support and blessings to the discussions that have begun at the moment,” PM Gunawardena added.
