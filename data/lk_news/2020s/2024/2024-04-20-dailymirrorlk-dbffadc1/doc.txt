In a daring robbery which has stunned authorities, thieves managed to steal electric cables worth over Rs.10 million from a train named ‘Nayana Kumari’ stationed at Hikkaduwa railway station, a top official said.

Deputy Superintendant- Railway Protection Force G.W. Sumith said the incident, had occurred in the early hours of Thursday, targeting the Nayana Kumari express train which had arrived the previous night from Colombo.
