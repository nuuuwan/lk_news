Migrated doctors return easing shortage concerns

Colombo, March 12 (Daily Mirror) - Doctors who had previously left Sri Lanka for various reasons are now returning to the country, providing a hopeful alleviation of the ongoing shortage of doctors, the Health Ministry said.

Deputy Director General (Medical Services) Dr. G. Wijesuriya, while speaking at a news briefing, highlighted this positive development, citing a recent downward trend in doctors leaving the country.

"Previously, there was a concerning trend where doctors, particularly those pursuing postgraduate training abroad, opted not to return to Sri Lanka. However, we are now witnessing a reversal of this trend, with an increasing number of doctors choosing to come back," stated Dr. Wijesuriya.

The Health Ministry also emphasized the importance of addressing this issue comprehensively, acknowledging ongoing discussions with relevant stakeholders to find effective solutions.
