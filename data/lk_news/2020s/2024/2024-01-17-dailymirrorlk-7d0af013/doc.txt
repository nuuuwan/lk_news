Theekshana makes top ten ODI bowling move as T20Is lead to host of changes

Jan. 17 (ICC) - While Wanindu Hasaranga's seven-wicket haul led to a 28-place jump, it was compatriot Maheesh Theekshana to make a noteworthy move to equal-eighth on the MRF Tyres ICC ODI Bowling Rankings.

Theekshana joined Afghan Mohammad Nabi with a rating of 648 after the latest update on Wednesday, after taking 1/15 (5) in a strong eight-wicket win over Zimbabwe at the R.Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.

Having missed the Cricket World Cup through injury, Hasaranga began his climb back up the rankings with 7/19 (5.5), moving the world class leg-spinner into the top 40. The leg-spinner also made a 15-spot jump on the ODI all-rounder rankings, moving 15 spots to 17th (187), the highest Sri Lankan in the list.

Most of the changes in the international game came via the T20 rankings through a host of bilateral series as teams begin their T20 World Cup 2024 preparations.

The biggest in terms of top ten moves came through matches between India and Afghanistan, with Axar Patel climbing to fifth spot after a mammoth 12-spot leap (667), edging Ravi Bishnoi (666) as the highest-ranked bowler from India on the list. A pair of two-wicket hauls helped the left-armer make the move, with the aformentioned pair of Hasaranga and Theekshana next in his sights in the shortest format.

Elsewhere in the bowling ranks across the world, New Zealand's Tim Southee (up eight spots to 18th) and Adam Milne (up 19 spots to 47th) were big movers in their first two matches against Pakistan, as well as newcomer Ben Sears, who climbed 47 spots into the top 100.

On the batting side, Yashasvi Jaiswal's quickfire 68 from just 34 balls meant he made a top ten climb of his own, up seven spots to sixth (739). Only top spot holder Suryakumar Yadav (869) stands above him in terms of India players, with Ruturaj Gaikwad (661) also in the top ten, sitting in ninth. Getting his opportunity in India colours, Shivam Dube has rocketed up to 58th (472).

While Finn Allen's record hundred on Wednesday won't count in his ranking numbers until next week, his knocks of 34 and 74 have led to an 11-spot jump to 16th (614). Fakhar Zaman's 14-spot jump to 81st was the other move of note from action in New Zealand.
