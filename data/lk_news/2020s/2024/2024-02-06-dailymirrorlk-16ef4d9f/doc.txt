Jailed VIPs enjoy in Prison Hospital; GMOF accuses prison hospital medical officer

Colombo, Feb 6 (Daily Mirror) - The Government Medical Officers' Forum (GMOF) yesterday accused the female medical officer in charge of Welikada prison of allowing VIPs who were imprisoned, to enjoy life inside the Prison Hospital.

GMOF President told Daily Mirror the authorities keep mum despite repeated complaints to the Health Ministry against the said medical officer of misusing her powers.

"The action of the said medical officer has not only allowed VIPs but also imprisoned drug smugglers to comfortably stay inside the prison hospital," he said.

Dr. Bellana said that in this situation, the real patients who are in the Welikada prison have lost the opportunity to receive a response.

Moreover, he said several complaints have been made to the Human Rights Council and to internal doctors and no action have been taken against the doctor yet.

Dr. Bellana said that the said doctor has come to work under the seal of being the Chief Medical Officer and that the Health Ministry has allowed her to work there for over five years.
