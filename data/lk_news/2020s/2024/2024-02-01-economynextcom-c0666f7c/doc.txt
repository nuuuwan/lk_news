Sri Lanka trade minister seeks to increase South Korea FDI, exports

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is looking to expand bilateral trade and investment with South Korea, its minister of trade has said.

Minister of Trade, Commerce and Food Security Nalin Fernando met South Korea Ambassador Miyon Lee to discuss investment and increasing exports.

“We discussed ways to expand the existing bilateral ties in the fields of Trade and Investment,” Fernando said on social media platform X.com after the meeting.

The discussions focused on increasing exports of coir products, coconut shell charcoal, rubber and spices from Sri Lanka, and attracting more Korean foreign investments into Sri Lanka, according to a statement by the Department of Government Information.

There were opportunities for Korean buyers to directly access gems and jewelry, tourism promotion, potential for flights from Sri Lanka to Korea, as well as to make investments in sustainable energy especially in wind power, Fernando said.

The two countries don’t have a bilateral trade agreement at present, although they are members of regional trade agreements. Sri Lanka’s President and his South Korean counterpart have discussed finalizing a trade agreement and enhancing investment relations between the two nations, when they met on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly sessions in New York.

In recent months Sri Lanka has sought to increase the export of labour to South Korea. (Colombo/Feb1/2024)
