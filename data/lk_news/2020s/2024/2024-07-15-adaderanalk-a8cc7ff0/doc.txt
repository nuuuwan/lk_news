Piyumi Hansamali will not be arrested until Sep. 20 - AG tells court

The Attorney General has informed the Court of Appeal that actress Piyumi Hansamali, who is under investigation over alleged money laundering charges, will not be arrested until September 20, 2024.

However, the court was informed that the relevant investigations carried out by the Illegal Assets Investigations Division of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) into her wealth, can be carried out without any hindrances.

Appearing on behalf of the Attorney General, the Deputy Solicitor General has communicated this to the court when a petition filed by Hansamali, seeking a writ order to suspend the said investigations, was taken up before Appeals Court Judge Sobhitha Rajakaruna today (15).

Accordingly, the court has ordered the petition to be recalled for consideration on September 20, 2024.
