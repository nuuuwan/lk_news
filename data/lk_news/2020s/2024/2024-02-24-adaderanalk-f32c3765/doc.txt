Five Indians apprehended off Sri Lanka as ‘Beedi’ smuggling attempt foiled

Five Indians have been apprehended in Sri Lanka for attempting to smuggle in a consignment of ‘Beedi’ leaves via sea routes.

The suspects were apprehended by the Sri Lanka Navy, along with 75 sacks of ‘Beedi’ leaves found in the dinghy they were on.

The ‘Beedi’ smuggling attempt was thwarted based on a tip-off received by the Excise Station in Negombo. Upon receiving the piece of information, the excise officers, along with a group of naval personnel, had mounted a special operation in the seas off Puttalam on Feb.19.

During the operation, a small boat with five Indians aboard was impounded while 2,175 kilograms of ‘Beedi’ leaves were seized.

The contraband is believed to have a value of around Rs. 20 million.

The apprehended Indian nationals, all aged below 20 years, had reportedly set sail from Thoothukudi, India.

Onward investigations into the incident are being carried out by the Negombo Excise Station.
