Excise deny fake reports circulating about liquor shops opened on April 13

The Excise Department today denied fake news circulating on social media that liquor shops will be opened on April 13.

The department issued a notice last week that the countrywide sale of liquor will be banned on April 12 and 13 in line with the Sinhala and Tamil New Year.

However, this does not apply to in house guests, both local and foreign tourists of the hotels and boutique villas beyond the three star range that are registered with the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority.

The regular sale of liquor in the country will commence from April 14, Sunday 8.00am onwards.
