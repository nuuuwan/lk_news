CEB introduces new installment scheme to obtain electricity connections

The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has introduced a special electricity connection scheme for small and medium-scale enterprises and residences, where they will pay 25% as down payment and the balance in installments.

Earlier this month, Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera had said that electricity consumers would be allowed to make the payments for their new connections on an installment basis, where they will be able to pay 25% of the connection fee upfront and the remaining amount within 10 or 12 installments.

Speaking in Parliament, he had said that the CEBâ€™s Board of Directors has also green-lighted this endeavor.
