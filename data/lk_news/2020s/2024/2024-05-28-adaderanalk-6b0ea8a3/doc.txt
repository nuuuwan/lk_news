Fishermen advised not to go to sea until further notice

The Department of Meteorology has issued an advisory for strong winds and rough seas for the sea areas around the island.

The ‘red’ alert states that the sea areas around the island will be very rough with very strong gusty winds up to 60-70kmph.

Thus, naval and fishing communities are advised not to venture into the sea areas around the island, until further notice, the advisory said.

Swell waves about 2.5 m – 3.0 m height (this is not for land area) may increase in the sea areas off the coast extending from Kalpitiya to Pottuvil via Colombo, Galle and Hambantota.

There is a possibility that near shore sea areas off the coast extending from Kalpitiya to Matara via, Colombo and Galle may experience surges due to swell waves, the advisory added.

Accordingly, naval and fishing communities are also requested to be attentive to future forecasts issued by the Department of Meteorology in this regard.
