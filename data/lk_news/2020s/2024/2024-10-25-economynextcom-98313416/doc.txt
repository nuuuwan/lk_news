Iran envoy pledges trade, technology support to Sri Lanka

ECONOMYNEXT – Iranian Ambassador to Sri Lanka has pledged to support the island nation on trade and technology among many other sectors, the President Media Division (PMD)  said.

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake met Iranian Ambassador, Alireza Delkhosh on Friday (25) at the Presidential Secretariat and discussed bilateral relationship between the two countries.

President Dissanayake emphasized the longstanding relationship between Sri Lanka and Iran and expressed his desire to strengthen ties between both countries.

“In response, the Ambassador reaffirmed Iran’s commitment to supporting Sri Lanka in trade, technology, culture, and education, as well as in new initiatives,” the PMD said in a stement.

The PMD said the President discussed the current situation in the Middle East and briefed the Ambassador on Sri Lanka’s security situation and highlighting recent measures taken to improve safety for both tourists and residents.

The brief on security situation came two days after a U.S. Embassy travel advisory revealed a planned attack on a tourism hotspot in the Eastern coast of Arugam Bay.

“He (Dissanayake) assured that Sri Lanka is committed to maintaining a secure environment,” PMD said.

Sri Lanka struck a tea for oil deal with Iran to repay due for crude imports before a U.S. sanction was imposed in 2012.

Under the arrangement, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) has been settling a longstanding payment liability of $250 million owed to Iran for oil purchased in 2012. (Colombo/October 25/2024)!
