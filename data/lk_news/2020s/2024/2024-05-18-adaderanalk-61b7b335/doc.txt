Heavy downpours and strong winds expected during next few days

Showery and windy conditions are expected to enhance during the next few days from today, due to pre-monsoonal conditions over the country and surrounding sea areas, the Department of Meteorology said.

In its latest forecast, issued at 12 noon, the department stated that cloudy skies can be expected over most parts of the island.

Meanwhile, showers or thundershowers will occur at times in Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central, North-western and Southern provinces and in Mannar district, it added.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places elsewhere of the island after 12.00 noon on Sunday (19).

Heavy showers above 100mm are likely at some places in Western, Sabaragamuwa and North-western provinces and in Galle, Matara, Kandy and Nuwara-Eliya districts.

Fairly strong winds about 30-40 kmph can be expected at times in Southern province, the Met. Department added.

Thus, general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
