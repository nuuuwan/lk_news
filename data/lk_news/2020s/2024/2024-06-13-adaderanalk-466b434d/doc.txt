Aura Lanka chairman Thambugala to make confidential statement to court

The Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court has scheduled the consideration of Aura Lanka Chairman Viranjith Thambugala’s request to provide a confidential statement before the court for July 18.

The case, filed over alleged financial fraud committed by Thambugala, was taken up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Pavitra Pathiraja today (June 13).

However, the officers from the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) were not present in court at the time.

Accordingly, the Additional Magistrate ordered the relevant request to make a confidential statement to be re-submitted to the court at the next hearing.

On May 22, the Chairman of Aura Lanka, businessman Viranjith Thambugala was arrested by police over allegations of misappropriation of nearly Rs. 70 million and was later granted bail after being produced before the Colombo Magistrate’s Court.
