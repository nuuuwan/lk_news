Sri Lanka Railways squatters to be leased land, charged tax

ECONOMYNEXT – Squatters on lands belonging to Sri Lanka’s Railways Department will be leased the land after an assessment, Minister of Transport and Highways and Mass Media Bandula Gunawardena has said.

The Railways Department owns the largest amount of land in the country.

“I have obtained cabinet approval to have the land and property occupied by squatters for over 10 years assessed, and then sign a lease agreement with them,” Gunawardena was quoted as saying in a statement by the State Information Department.

“All squatters who have been there less than 10 years will be prosecuted. Land grabbing now is useless.” Gunawardena was speaking at the inauguration of the Assistant Commercial Superintendent’s office in Nawalapitiya.

“In future, this office will carry out all commercial activities on the lands owned by the Railways Department from Rambukkana to Matale and Badulla.

“Squatters have to come to this office immediately and file appeals and get the properties assessed; an appeal will be heard on what’s going on. Those who have been there for more than 10 years should verify their identity and pay taxes. (Colombo/March11/2024)
