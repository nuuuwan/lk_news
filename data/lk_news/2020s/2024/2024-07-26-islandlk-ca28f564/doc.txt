Prez talk continues in SL; move in the USA; Brit example

The same questions are being asked in TV news broadcasts and becoming tedious and boring. There’s confusion, doubts, devious twists and even lies going on for the nth week.  The Elections Commissioner holds his tongue and MTV Channel 1 counts and announces starkly the days that pass since he was empowered to announce the date of the presidential election. Is he tongue-tied or hands bound? One thing that is going on apace is gift giving: Ranil W with deeds for possession of land in Jaffna, Colombo and elsewhere and Sajith P with computers and new IT teaching aids to schools, after gifting them buses and vans. Anura K D is doing the opposite: he is globe-trotting raking in the shekels while outlining his highfalutin principles for governing Paradise. Heard that Handunetti was poised to be Finance Minister. Oh My!

The SJB and the NPP have long selected their candidates for the presidency. The SLPP and SLFP, both admittedly sinking ships from which rats have jumped to preserve their MP perks to better bet parties, say they will announce the name shortly. The leader of the Pohottu Party stumbles along saying sagely that that party’s presidential candidate will be announced at the right time when it comes, while his son announced his party is not for Ranil W leading them though many Bud-dies have jumped off the lotus ship to join  RW’s miscellaneous group of followers/promoters. He is touted by many as a principal presidential candidate but has he voiced his assent as yet? He has affirmed that the presidential elections will be held this year.

In all this confusion Dhammika Perera holding millions in hand goes searching for a Party to back him. And up North a candidate has been selected by several Tamil parties coming together.

Confusion confounded! Typical of this country like no other. Sound, fury, canvassing, confounding while the economic situation of the land is still very unstable, rocky and people’s suffering increased.

Could we judge that the presidential race has ordered itself or been made more chaotic by Biden renouncing his candidature? No. It is a very good move for himself and the country as he was showing signs of ageing and slowing down and was absolutely no match to roller coaster Trump. If Biden had remained in the race, he would have been squashed by steamroller Trump, now revelling in his ‘shot’ ear, which to him makes him the great American martyr willingly giving his all, even his life, to make America great again. It was said that when the shot rang his security chap shouted “Donald Duck”.  Also, a video clip made its rounds and was said to be where 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks learnt to shoot!

And what of Kamala Harris? Her popularity declined steadily but Biden has endorsed her as his successor and Democrats have increasingly supported her as presidential candidate. Nancy Pelosi and the Clintons have endorsed her but not Obama as yet. Also the number of Democrats rallying around her is noted to be increasing.

Kamala Devi Harris, born to Tamil Nadu mother and Jamaican father, was District Attorney of San Francisco, and Attorney General of California before being sworn in as Vice President on January 20, 2021. Billed as the first woman, first Black American and first South Asian American to be elected to this position, she caused waves around the world. Cassandra for one was jubilant as she thought that Biden being old, he might pass on and Kamala Harris would become first woman President of the United States of America, supposedly the most powerful person on earth. But as noted earlier, her popularity waned though she is a vocal feminist and a strong believer in abortion being a woman’s right. She was critical when in 2022 the Supreme Court reversed the 1973 Roe v Wade ruling that established a framework for legal abortion across the US. The reversal eliminated a boon to women in the throes of unwanted pregnancies.

In recent BBC and Al Jazeera news broadcasts, Kamala Harris emerges as a super contender against Trump. She is very elite and decent against his known poor reputation; married and faithful against his continued immorality; very well spoken and knowledgeable against his bluff; young in her forties against his 78 age; and very smart and beautifully vivacious against his rather scowly sulk and orange hair. Donations to her campaign funds came in thick and fast and she has come forth as a very powerful speaker.

In his usual pugnacious way of speaking Trump denigrated her in a recent speech: “Kamala, I call her laughing Kamala. Have you seen her laughing? She is crazy. You can tell a lot by a laugh. She is nuts. She is not as crazy as Nancy Pelosi.” Not only is this offensive but gives the reader outside of the US the thought – how on earth can the American people vote for a crude and rude guy like this to be their president. But there are millions of crazy white conservative Americans who vote for him and believe in him and his promise to make America great.

So, now the American elections have turned interesting, unlike previously when it was a damp squib with Biden as contender. Latest on Wednesday July 24 was that Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly will contest to be the Democrats’ presidential nominee.

Reading on Trump makes one surmise there are quite a number of MPs of his ilk: ill-mannered, shouting, talking tosh and full of vainglory in our House by the Diyawanne.

In sharp contrast to Trump and his band of cheerleaders is Rishi Sunak as well as other British parliamentarians, as exemplified in a YouTube I watched of the Westminster speech made by PM Sunak when taking over as Leader of the Opposition. He started in a humorous vein, so typically British.  It went something like this (not exact words): “Let me pass on advice.  You may be tapped on the shoulder and called to high office: junior minister, Cabinet member and then handed over the highest office because of the untenable vision of the previous holder of the post. You are expected to be an elder statesman at the age of 44, leaving behind you a bright future.” Then he congratulated the new PM and Labour government which he said had won decisively. He avowed the Opposition would approve of good moves of governing but contest unwise moves. Excellent speech.  Cass feels that many of our MPs should listen to this and other British Parliamentary speeches and those of our own statesmen who were MPs of say five decades ago and earlier. Many of the present lot have so much to learn on parliamentary behavior, speech making, presenting arguments and listening too.
