Law reforms for system change: SJB Lawyers Federation to Propose 117 Reforms

Colombo, Feb 9 (Daily Mirror) - The SJB Lawyers Federation has announced its intention to present 117 proposals for substantial legal reforms aimed at bringing about a systemic change and introducing rationality to governance.

President of the SJB Lawyers Federation, President's Counsel Upul Jayasuriya, informed the media that the proposed laws would focus on family politics, suggesting that siblings of politicians should not enter politics until a cooling-off period after those already holding political office retire.

Jayasuriya emphasized that family members would be prohibited from entering into any government contracts while an immediate family member holds a political office.

The President of the SJB Lawyersâ€™ Federation also announced plans to withdraw the draconian Online Safety Bill and introduce a new bill under the SJB government to safeguard the rights of women and children online.

"These 117 proposals aim to bring rationality to governance. We cannot allow the protection of wrongdoers when they come to power. It is crucial to safeguard the judiciary and appoint honest judges to such positions," Jayasuriya added.

He stressed the significant responsibility of lawyers and media personnel in facilitating this systemic change.

"We cannot permit the misuse of state resources by public servants and politicians. Our proposal suggests that, from the President downwards, there should be only one official vehicle provided," he said.

SJB Lawyers Federation Secretary Attorney-at-law Sudath Wickramaratne and National Organizer Attorney-at-law Kamal Wijesiri also addressed the press conference in Colombo, providing insights into the legal framework for system change scheduled for launch on February 11.

The launch event will be held under the patronage of Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, with the participation of President of the Commonwealth Lawyers Association Peter Maynard, President of LAWASIA Shyam Divan, and President of the Bar Association of India Prashant Kumar.
