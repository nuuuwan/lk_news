Prices of imported eggs to go up from today

Trade Minister Nalin Fernando has announced that the prices of imported eggs will be increased, effective from Sunday (21 Jan.), in view of the increased Value Added Tax (VAT).

Speaking to the media today, Minister Fernando assured that there is no shortage of eggs in the market, and explained that a price hike is being implemented solely due to the increase in VAT.

Accordingly, the prices of eggs imported from India will be increased by Rs. 08, from Rs. 35 to Rs. 43, at all Lanka Sathosa outlets with effect from today.

Imported eggs were previously retailed at Rs. 35 per egg, while a carton was sold at Rs. 40 per egg at all Lanka Sathosa outlets.

Sri Lanka began to import eggs in the first half of 2023, amidst a severe shortage, in response to the soaring prices of eggs within the local market.
