Japan to assist in stabilizing power supply of Sri Lankan hospitals using renewable energy

The Government of Japan has agreed to provide project support of Japanese Yen 230 million (around Rs. 2.8 billion) through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for the provision of electricity facilities by establishing solar energy generation systems at Sri Jayawardenapura General Hospital, Kurunegala Teaching Hospital and Ratnapura Teaching Hospital.

The objectives of this project are to reduce the use of non-renewable energy in the health sector, to increase the overall efficiency of the health service sector and to promote sustainable development, the Cabinet Spokesman Minister Bandula Gunawardena said.

Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved the proposal regarding the implementation of this project presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies.
