Tourism sector still reeling from economic crisis

Colombo, June 1 (Daily Mirror) - Despite the signs of recovery, the tourism sector is still struggling with the aftershocks of the economic and political crisis, Tourism Minister Harin Fernando said.

Addressing a UN event, Fernando reflected upon the current state of the industry in his speech.

“Many people in the tourism industry, even top-end hotels, are still facing an issue with their moratoriums, having to pay back the loans that they took because of the hit that we had from Covid as well as the economic crisis and the political crisis. People are still coming out of it. We are not far from the woods. We have lot more to go, a lot more to do,” Fernando said.

The minister stressed upon the importance of a consistent tourism policy, increased government support and the urgent need of the sector to commit towards green initiatives.

“Politicians could change. Governments could change but we have to have a tourism policy to sustain tourism, to make sure that we reach our targets,” he opined.

“We are the last lap of finalising it. Therefore, it is the job of the government, the job of the Sri Lankan Tourism authority to help everyone in the industry moving into green, to make Sri Lanka at least a 50 percent green destination whilst going at our target in 2030, to move up to four million or five million tourists,” Fernando stated.

Expressing his optimism on achieving the goals, he further emphasised the need to retain the global attention Sri Lanka has been receiving with its gradual recovery.

“I am quite hopeful we can achieve all of this. After 15 years, we are launching a global campaign in all markets. I feel Sri Lanka will be right on top. Our tagline is Sri Lanka will come back for more.

Therefore, more experiences should be given, more sights and attractions should be seen, more new thinking should be given,” he said. (NR)
