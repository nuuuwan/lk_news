Confusion worse confounded

Minister of Justice and Constitutional Reforms Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe sought to quell the brouhaha over the proposed 22nd Amendment (to the Constitution) Bill. On Thursday, he assured that the Bill in question would not be gazetted until the conclusion of the upcoming presidential election. It was reported that he had instructed the Secretary to the Ministry of Constitutional Reforms not to proceed with the publication of a gazette containing the proposed Bill. He said he had done so to allay the suspicions and confusion in the public mind about the proposed constitutional amendment. But on Friday, the Bill was gazetted by order of the President!

The 22nd constitutional Amendment Bill has been published amidst rumours that the UNP is all out to have it passed with a two-thirds majority in Parliament and then place it before the people at a referendum. It is being claimed in some quarters that the MPs of all sides of the House have been given a choice between backing the constitutional amendment Bill and facing a snap general election. There are dozens of MPs who will be deprived of their pensions in case of a premature dissolution of Parliament, for they have not completed five years as lawmakers to qualify for retirement benefits.

What has triggered protests against the 22nd constitutional amendment Bill is the timing of it. If the government had not sought to present it to Parliament with only days to go until the declaration of the next presidential election, nobody would have opposed it.

The government has earned notoriety for causing elections to disappear for fear of losing them, besides being afraid of facing the upcoming presidential poll. It is therefore only natural that the draft Bill at issue has come to be widely viewed as a ruse to initiate a legislative process which will necessitate the holding of a referendum within weeks and thereby help delay the next presidential election.

The Opposition has gained a great deal of political mileage from its campaign against the proposed 22nd constitutional amendment Bill. It is a case of giving a dog a bad name and hanging it. The mere sight of a notorious pickpocket makes people tend to check for the safety of their wallets, doesnâ€™t it? Similarly, whenever the government seeks to introduce a new law and amend an existing one, the people suspect an ulterior motive and worry about the safety of democracy.

There is a school of thought that the Supreme Court has cleared all doubts about the constitutional provisions governing the length of the presidential term, etc., and therefore the government need not bring in a constitutional amendment to specify the durations in question. However, there will be no resistance to the proposed Bill if it is presented to Parliament after the presidential election; in fact, it is bound to be passed without a division in the House.

There are no signs of a new Constitution being formulated in the foreseeable future, and therefore the existing one should be rid of inadequacies, ambiguities, etc. However, constitutional amendments must not be introduced in an ad hoc manner for political reasons. Let an expert panel be appointed to identify all constitutional flaws and propose remedies so that they can be rectified in one go. Otherwise, there will be no end to piecemeal constitutional amendments and perhaps referenda as well.

Meanwhile, Commissioner General of Elections Saman Sri Ratnayake is reported to have said the gazetting of the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution will not stand in the way of the Election Commission declaring the presidential election. But the government is a dead man walking. Anything is possible in this country.
