Whose freedom are you celebrating? – Cardinal

Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith has emphasised the need to ‘free the country’ from oppressive leadership, and appoint a new leader.

Speaking at a special service held at the All Saint’s Church in Borella in view of Sri Lanka’s 76th Independence Day, the Cardinal charged that as of now, the country has fallen not only economically, but also politically.

“We ask the leaders whose freedom are you celebrating? The freedom of the rulers? The freedom of the people? Is it ‘freedom’ to invite foreign diplomats, and belittle those who are starving in front of the country’s elites?”, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith questioned.
