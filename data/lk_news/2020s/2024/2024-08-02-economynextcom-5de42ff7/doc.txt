Sri Lanka, Maldives, US Air forces in disaster response exercise

ECONOMYNEXT – Air forces of Sri Lanka, Maldives and the US will conduct joint exercises to boost disaster response, the American embassy in Colombo said.

The Montana National Guard and US Pacific Air Forces will conduct with the Sri Lanka Air Force and members of the Maldives National Defense Force, in the exercises labelled, ‘Atlas Angel.’

“With events in both Trincomalee and Colombo, and US C-130s flying personnel between the two cities, this exercise will culminate in a crisis management simulation to test our response capabilities, ensuring maximum preparedness in the event of true disaster,” the Embassy said.

The joint military exercise, aimed at enhancing preparation and response to natural and man-made disasters, will be held from August 5-9, with more than 70 US personnel and two C-130 Hercules aircraft participating alongside their Sri Lankan and Maldivian counterparts.

Atlas Angel will feature six exercises, including urban and medical search and rescue as well as airfield repair, culminating in a crisis management exercise on August 9.

The exercises are designed to test and improve response capabilities across various scenarios, ensuring participants are prepared for real-world disasters.

“Effective disaster management hinges on robust training that equips first responders, local authorities, and community members with the skills and knowledge they need to act decisively in times of crisis,” Montana National Guard Adjutant General Pete Hronek said.

“Throughout this week, I look forward to working with regional counterparts and learning from their expertise as we go through realistic simulations, ensuring we are all ready to act in the event of an emergency.” :

Following the main exercise, US Air Force surgeons will engage in a knowledge exchange session at the Kothalawala Defence University in Colombo, sharing best practices with Sri Lankan military and civilian medical counterparts.

“Disasters know no borders and are increasing in frequency and intensity worldwide,” US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung said.

International collaboration was important “to minimize damage, protect lives and livelihoods, and foster resilience and prosperity in the region,” she said.

“Exercise Atlas Angel is one of the main combined exercises operationalized under the Montana State Partnership Program and it provides space for greater engagement between Sri Lanka Air Force and Montana National Guard,” Commander of the Sri Lanka Air Force, Air Marshal Udeni Rajapaksa said.
