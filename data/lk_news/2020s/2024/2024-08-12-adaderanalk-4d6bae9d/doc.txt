Election Commission plans talks amid Grama Niladhari Officers’ strike

The Election Commission has stated that despite the All-Island Grama Niladhari Officers’ Association previously agreeing to carry out all duties related to the presidential election without issues, they plan to negotiate with the association again.

When inquired by Ada Derana, regarding the potential impact of the Grama Niladhari officers’ strike on the presidential election, the Chairman of the Election Commission, R.M.A.L. Ratnayake revealed this.

However, the Grama Niladhari Officers’ Alliance announced that they will withdraw from all duties today (12) and tomorrow (13) and will begin a week-long nationwide protest.

The co-President of the Grama Niladhari officers’ Alliance Nandana Ranasinghe, stated that the strike is in response to their proposals not being included in the gazetted Grama Niladhari officers’ service constitution.

He also mentioned that they would hold a silent protest in front of the Ministry of Public Administration this morning (12).
