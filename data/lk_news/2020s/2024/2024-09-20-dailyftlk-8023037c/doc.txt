Canton Fair organisers visit EDB to scale up trade relationship between China and Sri Lanka

A delegation from the Canton Fair Operations Department of China visited the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) on 30 August 2024 to scale up trade relations between the two countries by participating in trade promotional events such as Canton Fair 2024.

China was the 10th largest export destination for Sri Lanka in 2023. The total export value from Sri Lanka to China was $ 258 million in 2023, while total imports from China to Sri Lanka during the same period amounted to $ 3,090 million. China has emerged as one of the key trading partners for Sri Lanka in recent past.

Realising the existing potential in the Chinese market, a number of trade promotional activities are being organised by the EDB in China, aiming to invite Chinese importers and investors to explore business opportunities in Sri Lanka.

The enthusiasm of Sri Lankan companies to enter the export market and expand trade relations with their Chinese counterparts is evident through their participation in the promotional programs such as China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai, China International Small and Medium Enterprises Fair (CISMEF) Guangzhou, Kunming Import and Export Fair and Canton Fair etc.

During the 2022 COVID-19 pandemic, EDB organised Sri Lankan participation in the Canton Fair online. 15 companies participated in the April edition, and 40 companies successfully took part in the October edition, publishing their profiles on the Canton Fair website.

The 136th Canton Fair will open in autumn 2024 at the Canton Fair Complex, Guangzhou, China. It is typically held on specific days each year during 15 October - 4 November 2024 in three phases. The EDB was invited to organise Sri Lankan participation by the visiting delegation.

During the discussion, EDB assured to give wide publicity on the Canton Fair 2024 among the Sri Lankan exporter community for their individual participation and agreed to consider organising Sri Lanka Pavilion at the 137th Canton Fair in 2025.

Canton Fair Operations Department of China Deputy Director Liao Zhihao, Deputy Director Zhang Chao and Staff Yang Yuyan, EDB Chairman and CEO Dr. Kingsley Bernard and the EDB officials participated at the discussion.
