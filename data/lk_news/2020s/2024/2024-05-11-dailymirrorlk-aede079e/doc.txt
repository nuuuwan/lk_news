Some players excluded from new contracts despite ICC T20 World Cup roles

Colombo, May 11 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has unveiled a revamped contract structure for forty-one national players, with substantial raises in player fees across all formats, ahead of the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup.

The decision comes as part of SLC's efforts to recognize and reward players based on their performance and rankings in international cricket.

However, despite their roles as traveling reserves for the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup, certain players like Bhanuka Rajapaksa and young spinner Vijayakanth Viyaskanth have been excluded from the new contract.

Under the new contract system, which includes six categories (A1, A2, B2, C1, C2, and the 'A' Team), match fees for Test matches have been doubled, marking a 100 percent increase.

In addition, payments for Test matches will now be merit-based, varying depending on whether the match is won, drawn, or lost.

The SLC said that match fees for One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is) have been raised by 25 percent.

Meanwhile, players who achieve top rankings in the ICC Player Rankings will receive one-time financial rewards. This includes recognition for the 'Best Batsman,' 'Best Bowler,' or 'Best All-Rounder' based on ICC rankings across all formats. Furthermore, players ranked between 2nd and 10th place in the ICC rankings will also be acknowledged with one-time payments for their outstanding contributions.

Also, daily allowances and per diems for all contracted players have been enhanced to provide better support during national teamâ€™s inbound and outbound engagements.
