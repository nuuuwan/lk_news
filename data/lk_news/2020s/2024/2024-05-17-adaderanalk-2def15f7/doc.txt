Gammanpila urges govt to reject new US Ambassador nominee

Member of Parliament Udaya Gammanpila has urged the government not to accept the appointment of U.S. President Joe Biden’s nominee for Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Elizabeth K. Horst.

Gammanpila pointed out that Elizabeth Horst’s responses to the questions raised by the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee on May 9 could have an adverse impact on the situation of the country.

The opposition parliamentarian made these remarks during a press conference held in Colombo, regarding the new US Ambassador nominee’s recent statement before the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

The US Ambassador nominee to Sri Lanka, Elizabeth K. Horst, said that if confirmed she will support members of marginalized populations, accountability, truth and reconciliation, and transparency and justice in Sri Lanka.

“I will support members of marginalized populations, accountability, truth and reconciliation, and transparency and justice in Sri Lanka,” she said, appearing before the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee recently.

Security collaboration between the two nations was also emphasized, particularly in addressing transnational crime, enhancing maritime security, and responding to natural disasters in the strategically significant Indian Ocean region.

If the appointment is confirmed, Elizabeth K. Horst will succeed the current U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Julie Chung, in representing the interests of the United States in the South Asian island nation.
