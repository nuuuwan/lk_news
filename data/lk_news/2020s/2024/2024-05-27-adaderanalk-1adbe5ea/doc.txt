Gotabaya inherited a collapsed govt, not the strong one built by Mahinda, claims Namal

SLPP MP Namal Rajapaksa has claimed that a serious conspiracy was underway to overthrow the government established by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

He stated that this conspiracy involved several forces even within the government itself.

“The conspiracy was internal, with international forces and terror groups also attempting to destabilize the government. As a result, the ‘Yahapalana’ (good governance) government was formed. Gotabaya Rajapaksa inherited a collapsed government, not the strong one built by Mahinda Rajapaksa,” he added.

He made these comments while addressing the inaugural constituency conference of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) held in Thalawa on Sunday (26), under the patronage of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Despite attending the event, Mahinda Rajapaksa did not address the gathering during the conference.
