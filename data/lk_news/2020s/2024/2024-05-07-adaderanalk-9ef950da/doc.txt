Showery conditions over most parts of the island to enhance in next few days

The Meteorology Department says an enhancement of showery condition over most parts of the island is expected during next few days (after May 08th).

Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places in Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central, North-western, Uva and Eastern provinces and in Galle and Matara districts after 2.00 p.m.

Showers or thundershowers may occur at a few places elsewhere during the afternoon or night.

Showers may occur over the coastal areas of Puttalam to Hambantota via Colombo and Galle during the morning too, it said.

Fairly heavy showers about 50 mm are likely at some places in Western, Sabaragamuwa and Uva provinces and in Galle and Matara districts.

Misty conditions can be expected at some places in Central and Sabaragamuwa provinces during the morning.

General public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
