Sri Lanka teacher salary hike, graduates drive up wage bill in 2023 as other sectors fall

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s government salary bill fell to 939 billion rupees in 2023 from 956 billion amid a hiring and wage freeze but provincial council salary costs went up due to teachers and graduates, official data showed.

The central government salary bill fell to 327.29 billion rupees in 2023 down from 367.4 billion rupees in 2022, as retirees were not replaced and wages were frozen.

But the transfers for wages of provincial councils went up 10 percent to 300.2 billion rupees, from 268.8 billion rupees.

“This increase was mainly due to the impact of salary increase given to the Teachers in 2022 and the salaries of the graduates attached to Provincial Councils which were borne by the Provincial Councils Budget in 2023,” the 2023 Final budget report said.

The teacher salary increment in a 2022 budget after teachers  was paid in stages in 2022 and 2023.
