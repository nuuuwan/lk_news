Japan gives Sri Lanka 40,000 tons of diesel for health services

ECONOMYNEXT – The Japanese government has given 40,000 metric tons of diesel for transportation in Sri Lanka’s health services, including ambulances.

A fuel management information system (FIMS) will track the distribution of the diesel stocks under the direct supervision of the Japanese government, a statement by the Department of Government Information said.

Distribution activities will be carried out in collaboration with the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation.

Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Misukoshi Hideaki, officially presented the grant to Minister of Health and Industry Dr Ramesh Pathirana at the “Dolphin Jetty” terminal in the Colombo Port on Monday (19).

Sri Lanka’s health sector is beset with many problems including shortages of labour, medicine and equipment. Suwasariya, a free ambulance service, which was set up with a 22.5 million US dollar grant from India, faced a lack of resources when the Sri Lanka government took over after three years, amidst a foreign exchange crisis that brought on a fuel shortage.
