Damitha Abeyratne and husband arrested by CID

Sri Lankan actress Damitha Abeyratne and her husband were arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) today (04).

The arrest came after the couple, who had been wanted by the CID, appeared before the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court earlier.

The CID is currently carrying out an investigation into Abeyratne and her husband, in relation to their involvement in an alleged money scam.

Speaking to the media at the courts premises, Abeyratne said: "I was not in hiding. Damitha is not someone who can hide in this country; she is a woman who fought against the corrupt system that garnered 69 lakh votes. Today, I surrender to the court. I will also celebrate the New Year in prison."

The Computer Crimes Division of the CID had initiated an investigation into the alleged defrauding of Rs. 3 million by the couple on the promise of employment in South Korea. Subsequently, the CID informed the court that Abeyratne and her husband would be named as suspects of the relevant case.

Accordingly, Fort Magistrate’s Court recently rejected a writ petition filed seeking to prevent their arrest.

Meanwhile, Fort Magistrate Thilina Gamage imposed an overseas travel ban on the couple on Wednesday (03), with respect to the incident.
