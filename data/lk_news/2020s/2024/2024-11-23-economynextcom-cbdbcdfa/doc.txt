Sri Lanka to set up tourism commission: Minister Herath

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will combine existing agencies and set up a Tourism Commission for the sector, the Indian Ocean island’s Foreign and Tourism Minister said.

“We plan to combine the agencies within the Tourism Ministry and appoint a Commission,” Minister Herath told reporters in Kandy.

“Through a merger of agencies we target to revive the sector.”

Unlike other export sectors, which takes time to revive, tourism is an area where quick wins can be scored, he said.
