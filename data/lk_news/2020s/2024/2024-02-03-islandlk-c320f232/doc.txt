Nailspa celebrates their 20th anniversary

NailSpa celebrated its 20th anniversary, as pioneers in the nail industry recently. Twenty years ago, Nilanthi Genevieve Weerasinghe, founded NailSpa (Pvt) Ltd., and pioneered the opening of the very first stand-alone professional nail salon in Sri Lanka. Specializing in hand & feet treatments, her nail salon focused on nail extensions and nail art, and soon evolved into offering its fast-growing clientele extensive hand and feet treatments.

The gala event of 20th anniversary was held at Grand Raffles Residence on 11th December with a host of distinguished guests gracing the occasion.

NailSpa continued to lead the industry opening several outlets around the country, starting at Cinnamon Lakeside â€“ then known as (Trans Asia Hotel), Odel-Ward Place, Kess Salon, K-Zone JaEla, One Galle Face and later, opening a fully-fledged Spa & Salon with a fantastic view, at the Movenpick Hotels. Pioneering in Eyebrow Microblading, NOVALASH Extensions and Semi Permanent Lip Blush and, the VERY FIRST to introduce high-tech Pedi-massage chairs with a human-touch-massage, the salon was supported with internationally trained staff, using only international branded products. Superseding the industry NailSpa became the No.1 destination for local/foreign clientele seeking international standard, hand & feet treatments.
