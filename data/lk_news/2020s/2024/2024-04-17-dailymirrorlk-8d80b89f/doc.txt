Colombo, April 17 (Daily Mirror) - In response to alarming shootings by criminals, IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon said that a team of 100 police personnel is undergoing training to go after motorbike riders engaging in criminal activities.

He said this team is being trained at the Police Special Task Force (STF) training camp at Katukurunda.

"The team will be trained to respond to incidents involving gunmen committing crimes on motorcycles and take necessary actions against them," he said.

These trained officers will receive special uniforms, 50 specialized motorcycles and firearms and they will commence anti-underworld duties starting May 1st.

Accordingly, four officers will be assigned to each of the 25 selected police stations in the Western Province where crimes are reported the most.

Meanwhile, the IGP said that the underworld and drug trafficking will be eliminated within the next three months.

IGP Tennakoon said that recent measures have significantly curbed underworld activities and drug trafficking in the country.

"We have already deployed 20 special police teams, each comprising 100 police officers, in several areas to arrest underworld criminals. We will increase that number to 30 teams soon. If required, that number can be increased up to 100," he said.
