SLFP faction distances from Maithriâ€™s claims

Colombo, April 29 (Daily Mirror) - In an effort to nip any discord with India in the bud, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) faction led by Nimal Siripala de Silva as acting chairman called on Indian High Commissioner Santosh Jha and disassociated itself from remarks by its former Chairman Maithripala Sirisena implicating alleged Indian involvement in orchestrating the Easter Sunday attacks, an informed source said.

Earlier, there were media reports about Mr. Sirisena implicating India in the attack in his statement to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).

Last week, Public Security Minister Tiran Alles said in Parliament that Mr. Sirisena had not mentioned the name of any Sri Lankan or Sri Lankan organization in the statement to the CID. The SLFP is currently divided and Mr. Sirisena is facing an enjoiningorder which prevents him from functioning as the party chairman.

On behalf of the faction opposed to him, MPS Lasantha Alagiyawanna, Duminda Dissanayake, Suren Raghavan and Faizer Mustapha called on the Indian envoy to clarify the matter, according to the source.

They have reportedly disavowed purported claims by Mr. Sirisena in this regard and asserted the importance of maintaining healthy, positive ties with India.

The SLFP is currently involved in a legal battle with the faction led by Minister Siripala de Silva and former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga trying to take control of the party by ousting Mr. Sirisena.

Mr. Sirisena recently stoked controversy saying that he was aware who masterminded the Easter Sunday bombings.
