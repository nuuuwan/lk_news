Sri Lanka CSE to list riskier bonds targeting qualified investors

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Colombo Stock Exchange said it will allow companies with below investment grade rating to sell and list stocks to qualified investor who are able to manager riskier assets.

“Only specific types of companies, such as those regulated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka or the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka, are eligible to issue these High-Yield Bonds,” the CSE said in a statement.

“This ensures that regulated entities, including banks, non-banking financial institutions, and insurance companies, can participate in this new financing opportunity.”

Trading will occur on the high-yield debt will be allowed on an Over-the-Counter (OTC) Platform, and will be restricted “qualified investors”.

“These investors, similar to those in Basel III-compliant securities, are typically more experienced in managing risks,” the CSE said.

“They have the opportunity to diversify their portfolios by investing in bonds that offer potentially higher returns but come with increased risk, as they often manage portfolios with a broader risk appetite.”

Earlier only companies with rating one notch above investment grade was allowed to list debt, the CSE said. (Colombo/Oct11/2024)
