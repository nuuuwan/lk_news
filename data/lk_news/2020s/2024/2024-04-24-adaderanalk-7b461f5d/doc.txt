Injunction against appointing Wijeyadasa as SLFP’s Acting Chairman

The Colombo District Court today issued an injunction order preventing the appointment of Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe as the Acting Chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).

The court has also issued an injunction order preventing MP Sarathie Dushmantha Mithrapala from functioning as the General Secretary of SLFP.

Colombo District Judge Sandun Withana issued these orders after considering a plaint filed against the respective appointments.

Meanwhile, the court issued another injunction preventing the implementation of the decisions taken by the SLFP Acting General Secretary.

The Colombo District Judge issued these injunctions after considering a plaint submitted by Ministers Mahinda Amaraweera, Lasantha Alagiyawanna and Member of Parliament Duminda Dissanayake.

It was mentioned in the order that these injunctions will remain in effect until May 08, 2024.

Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was appointed as the Acting Chairman of SLFP during an executive committee meeting held on April 21, by the party’s faction led by former President Maithripala Sirisena, who has been prevented from functioning as SLFP chairman by a court order.
