President orders to gazette 22nd Amendment withheld by Justice Minister

The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution has been published via a Gazette notification by order of President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

On Thursday (18), Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe had instructed his ministry’s secretary not to publish the Gazette notification on the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution until the Presidential Election is held.

However, the Justice Minister had claimed that this decision was made in order to eliminate the uncertainty regarding the holding of the presidential election.

This amendment will enable the paragraph (b) of Article 83 of the Constitution pertaining to the President’s term to be amended by replacing the words “to over six years” with the words “to over five years” stated in paragraph (b) of Article 83 of the Constitution.
