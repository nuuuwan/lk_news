In a pioneering move towards sustainability, BNI Sri Lanka, the leading business networking organisation dedicated to helping businesses grow through mutual support and collaboration, is proud to announce that its upcoming annual conference scheduled for the 6 June at the Shangri La Hotel, will be the first ever carbon-neutral BNI conference in history. This ground-breaking initiative highlights BNI’s commitment to environmental responsibility and sets a new benchmark for its future events across the world.

BNI Sri Lanka has partnered with Planetary Carbon Standard, a global initiative committed to reducing atmospheric carbon and mitigating the effects of global warming through accelerated afforestation and reforestation projects. Planetary Carbon Standard as a global program evaluates and monitors carbon sequestration via green initiatives and renewable energy. By utilising advanced technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence for transparency and integrity, Planetary Carbon Standard is dedicated to removing excess carbon from the atmosphere and addressing the impacts of global warming.

Planetary Carbon Standard will meticulously plan and implement strategies aimed at minimising the BNI conference’s carbon footprint, offsetting the total carbon emissions related to scope I and scope II. As such, Planetary Carbon Standard, will be the Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) partner for the BNI Sri Lanka national conference 2024. By collaborating with Planetary Carbon Standard, BNI Sri Lanka ensures that its carbon-neutral objectives are grounded in scientific expertise and best practices in environmental sustainability.

Planetary Carbon Standard Founder Imran Ali stated: “Our partnership with BNI Sri Lanka represents a significant step forward in demonstrating that large-scale events can be environmentally responsible. By integrating our ESG strategies and nature-based carbon solutions with BNI’s commitment to sustainability, we are collectively working towards a greener future. Our ESG strategy development methodologies are aligned with international standards and are globally recognised.”Top of Form
