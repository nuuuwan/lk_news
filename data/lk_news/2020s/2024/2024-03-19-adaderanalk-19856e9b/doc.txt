Customs employees launch work-to-rule campaign; 4,000 containers held up at port

At least 4,000 containers are reportedly held up at the Colombo Port as a result of the trade union action launched by the employees of Sri Lanka Customs on Friday (March 15).

Initially, the Customs officials including superintendents and staff officers only boycotted working extra hours, however, they resorted to a work-to-rule campaign at 9 a.m. today (March 19) it is expected to go on until 4.45 p.m.

Calling a media briefing, the chairman of the Customs Officers’ Union Amila Sanjeewa attributed the reason behind the trade union action to the Treasury’s decision to bring the Customs Officers Reward Fund under the purview of the Finance Ministry.

After the work-to-rule campaign ends this evening, the Customs employees will once again refrain from working overtime, Mr. Sanjeewa added.

Against this backdrop, the president of the Container Transport Owners’ Association, Sanath Manjula warned that the importers are likely to be afflicted if the situation goes on.

He also emphasized that manufacturers would face difficulties without being able to get their hands on the raw materials required for productions.

In addition, only a limited amount of essential food items and medicine are being cleared by the Customs officials, Mr. Manjula pointed out further.
