Private medical practice under lens as complaints mount

Colombo, April 3 (Daily Mirror) - In light of a plethora of complaints over the proliferation of quacks and fake medical centres in Sri Lanka, the Health Ministry has decided to strictly securitize private medical practice.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, Director General of Health Services Dr Asela Gunawardena said the decision to weed out the illegal practice of medicine was taken following a thorough study and a deluge of complaints pertaining to the private medical practice.

“The matter was extensively discussed at the Private Health Regulatory Council where all the provincial directors were told to take the initiative by informing all the individuals engaged in private medical practice to get themselves registered,” he stated.

“As such, it’s compulsory for all private medical practitioners and medical centres including laboratories to get themselves registered at the provincial level,” he pointed out.

Further, Dr Gunawardena said they had so far received positive feedback to the initiative as illegal medical practice has become a parasite to the health sector

The GMOA recently raised serious concerns over the prevalence of quacks in Sri Lanka insisting the Health Ministry to take stern action.

In Sri Lanka, the practice of medicine is regulated, requiring individuals to possess a valid registration with either the Sri Lanka Medical Council, Ayurvedic Medical Council, or Homeopathic Medical Council, and meet required qualifications.

According to reports, there exist various groups of individuals masquerading as doctors, including those without basic medical qualifications, engaging in unauthorized medical practices, and impersonating legitimate healthcare professionals. Surveys estimate that upwards of 40,000 such individuals operate with impunity nationwide, exploiting legal loopholes and evading enforcement efforts
