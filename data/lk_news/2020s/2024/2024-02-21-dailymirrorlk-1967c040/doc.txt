Pilot project underway to convert existing three-wheeler into an EV

Colombo, Feb 21 (Daily Mirror) - A total of 1,184,423 three-wheelers are currently registered in Sri Lanka and the Transport Ministry is to implement a pilot project to popularize the registration and use of electric vehicles as a basic activity in relation to the e-mobility policy.

With the aim of reducing environmental damage and limiting the increasing use of fuel-efficient three-wheelers, the electrification pilot project was implemented by the Transport and Highways Ministry and the Department of Motor Transport in collaboration with the United Nations Development Agency (UNDP).

A progress review meeting in this regard was held at the Ministry where stakeholders were informed.

In this project, the three-wheelers that are currently powered by fuel will be converted to electricity, and the opinions of all stakeholders were consulted and discussed about the relevant technical, operational and practical conditions.
