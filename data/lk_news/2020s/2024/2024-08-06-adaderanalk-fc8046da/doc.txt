Ayurveda & Buildings departments are lowest performing, revealed before COPA

The Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) has expressed its displeasure over the performance of the Buildings Department and Ayurveda Department, when the committee met in Parliament recently under the Chairmanship of the State Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna.

The Committee Chair has pointed out during the meeting that COPA maintains a data system regarding the performance of government institutions under its purview and according to that data, the Building Department and the Ayurveda Department have been identified as the two institutions with the lowest performance.

As a result, it was decided to summon both these institutions before the Committee on one day, the Committee Chair further mentioned, the Parliamentary Communications Department said.

The Auditor General’s reports and current performance of the Building Department for the financial years 2020 and 2021 and the Ayurvedic Department for the financial years 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 were examined at the Committee meeting held, it added.

The Committee pointed out to the officials that the building department has a major role to play in preparing the building rate schedule (BSR) for construction and there is a concern as to whether it is being done properly.

Thus, the officials pointed out that the website of the building department states that any government agency can get this service through the building department and accordingly the service will be provided to the parties who request the service. But they pointed out that their organization has not received any guidance that this service must be provided.

Accordingly, the Committee recommended officials to take some action within a month after discussing this with the Ministry of Finance.

Furthermore, attention was paid to the matters mentioned in the Auditor General’s reports regarding the Department of Ayurveda and the Committee expressed its displeasure regarding the performance of both these institutions.

Members of Parliament for this Committee, Sivagnanam Shritharan, J. C. Alawathuwala, Madhura Withanage and Dr. Harini Amarasuriya were present at the Committee meeting held, according to the Parliamentary Communications Department.
