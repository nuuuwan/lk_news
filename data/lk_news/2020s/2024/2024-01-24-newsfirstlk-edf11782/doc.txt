Trump takes decisive step towards Republican Party nomination for president

Colombo (News 1st) – Former President Donald Trump took a firm step towards securing the Republican Party nomination for the U.S. presidential election scheduled for November 2024, with a resounding victory in the party primary in the state of New Hampshire, US media reported on Wednesday (24th).

With 70% of votes now counted, the former president is up 54.4% to former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley's 43.6%.

Ms. Haley conceded defeat in New Hampshire, but vowed to continue her campaign.

The two major parties – Republican and Democratic – hold an election in each state at which the respective party members get to vote for their choice for party nominees. The popular nominees become clear as soon as a handful of the 50 states conduct these elections, which are known as caucuses or primaries. New Hampshire was the second such contest.

Trump won the first such contest in the state of Iowa a week ago. All other challengers then dropped out of the race, except for Ms. Haley, who is attempting to become the first woman to serve as president.

Incumbent President Joe Biden is expected to be nominated by the Democratic Party, although he has several challengers.
