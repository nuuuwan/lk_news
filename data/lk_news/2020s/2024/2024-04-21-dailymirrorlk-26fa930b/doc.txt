Total of 40,000 teacher shortages in schools countrywide: Stalin

Colombo, April 21 (Daily Mirror) - There is a total shortage of 40,000 teachers in schools in the country, General Secretary of the Ceylon Teachers' Union, Joseph Stalin said.

Addressing the media, he said the shortage of teachers in schools is reported in the Western, Eastern, North-Central, Southern and Uva Provinces.

Accordingly, nearly 7,000 shortages of teachers were reported in the Western Province; nearly 3,800 shortages were reported in the Eastern Province, 3,698 shortages were reported in the North-Central Province; 3,100 shortages were reported in the Southern Province; and nearly 6,200 shortages were reported in the Central Province.

The government is purposely delaying teacher appointments to save on government expenses, Stalin said.

"Without filling the existing vacancies, a critical situation will occur in schools in these areas.

"However, the government recruited 2,500 teachers twice for the Western Province, but they have not recruited properly. Even though the schools start next week, there will be no teachers in some schools," Stalin added.

Therefore, teachers should be assigned to the existing teacher vacancies in a proper way, Stalin said.
