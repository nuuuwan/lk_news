Section of Colombo–Kandy road to be closed intermittently

The Colombo–Kandy main road will be intermittently closed near the Pahala Kadugannawa area on Saturday (08), says the Kegalle District Secretary.

Accordingly, the section of the road will be closed from time to time between 10.30 a.m. and 6.30 p.m.

The Kegalle District Secretary also said that the closure is necessary to remove unstable rocks and tree branches along this section of the road.
