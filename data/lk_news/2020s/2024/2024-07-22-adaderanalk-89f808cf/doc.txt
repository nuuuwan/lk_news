Chamari smashes first-ever century in Women’s T20 Asia Cup history

Sri Lanka’s captain Chamari Athapaththu scored the first-ever century in the history of the Women’s Twenty-20 Asia Cup.

This is the Sri Lankan all-rounder’s third century in T20 internationals.

Opener Athapaththu smashed an unbeaten 119 runs with 14 boundaries and 7 sixes in just 69 deliveries. She remained not out as Sri Lanka reached 184/4 at the end of 20 overs.

Having won the toss against Malaysia this afternoon (22), Sri Lanka captain Athapaththu elected to bat first with a semi-final spot in the women’s Asia Cup well within their sight.

Chasing the 184 set by Sri Lanka, this is a must-win for Malaysia, who were beaten convincingly by Thailand in their opening fixture.

The ACC Women’s Asia Cup cricket tournament kicked off on Friday (19) at the Rangiri Dambulla International Cricket Stadium.

Hosts Sri Lanka commenced their Asia Cup tournament with a dominating seven-wicket victory over Bangladesh Women on Saturday (20).
