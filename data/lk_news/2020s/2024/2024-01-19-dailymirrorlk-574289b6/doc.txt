Parliamentary Committee raises concerns over PUCSLâ€™s inaction to digitalise system

Parliament, Dec. 19 (Daily Mirror)- A Parliamentary Committee has raised concerns regarding the indifferent approach of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) towards digitalising the system, claiming that it had allowed the creation of a mafia within the system.

These concerns were raised when the Committee took into consideration the Annual Report of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka 2020 recently.

The Committee questioned why the PUCSL and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) are falling behind in working towards digitalising the system when Parliament has requested for a dispatch audit and accurate data.

The Committee highlighted that human intervention should be minimized and that the inaction to carry out directives given by Parliament is a disrespect to Parliament.

The Committee also expressed displeasure on the lack of action in digitalizing, which had allowed the creation of a mafia within the system.

The Committee further stated that allowing such a mafia only burdens the consumer and that the PUCSL officials should stand more firmly to rectify this situation.

The matter was discussed when the Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Economic and Physical Plans met in Parliament recently under the chairmanship of Parliamentarian Mahinanda Aluthgamage to consider five Annual Reports.
