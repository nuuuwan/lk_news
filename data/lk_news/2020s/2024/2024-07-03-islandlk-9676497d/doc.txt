Fun-filled outing

I guess the older folks would remember the good ole days, when we had ‘The Young Ones,’ ‘Teen Page,’ etc.

Well, three stalwarts, from that era, are planning a day’s outing in order to meet and greet some of the older folks, as well as the present day young ones.

Dilanth De Silva, Mazeeha Halaj and Dayanthi Senanayake, popular figures on social media (Facebook), say that the outing will be to a resort in Negombo and will include lunch, afternoon tea, snacks, etc., plus fun games, with prizes to be won.

The date mentioned is Saturday, 27th July, but they need confirmation from those wanting to be a part of this fun-filled package by 20th July.

You are required to call Dilanth (0772364301), Mazeeha (0775199807) or Dayanthi (0773541254) for more details, and the cost.
