Sri Lanka seeks employment for seamen on Greek ships

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has asked Greece if it could increase employment opportunities for Sri Lankan sailors on Greek ships, the prime minister’s office said after Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena met Greek ambassador Aliki Koutsomitopoulou.

“Bilateral relations, trade and investment promotion, maritime issues and commercial marine employment opportunities were discussed here,” a statement by the PMO said.

The ambassador is said to have expressed her willingness to discuss employment opportunities for Sri Lankans with shipping companies.

Greece and Sri Lanka have both faced economic crises, which saw them both declare sovereign debt default. “The reform measures taken to recover from the crisis were also discussed,” the PMO statement said.

State Minister of Defense Premitha Bandara Tennakoon had said earlier this week that discussions were also held with the Foreign Ministry to allocate a job quota for retired military personnel and family members when the Government sends workers for foreign employment. (Colombo/Jun6/2024)
