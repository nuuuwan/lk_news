Roundtable discussion on education technology in Sri Lanka

ECONOMYNEXT – A roundtable discussion on “Ed-tech towards achieving SDGs”, organized by the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka, Southern Voice, and Peru’s Group for the Analysis of Development (GRADE) will take place on February 27, from 2.30-3.30 pm.

“Amid the accelerated use of education technology (Ed-tech) since the COVID-19 pandemic, a crucial focus is placed on ensuring that Ed-tech contributes to the attainment of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 ‘Quality Education’, is accessible to all, and does not create nor widen existing inequalities in education,” IPS said in a statement.

“The hybrid roundtable discussion aims to facilitate a conversation among regional-level implementing agencies, policymakers, and other relevant stakeholders to influence policies that support the effective and efficient use of Ed-tech across Asia and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) in the future.”

The discussion will focus on four key areas: (1) ensuring access to EdTech, (2) use of EdTech to fill existing gaps in education, (3) the role of EdTech in improving access to quality education, and (4) barriers/challenges for the effective use of technology in education.

Participants can submit questions, which will be directed to relevant participants in the Asia and MENA regions who will be joining virtually.

The discussion will be livestreamed via Zoom. For more details, including the submission of questions and event registration links, visit: https://www.ips.lk/events-2/ or email: events@ips.lk.

IPS will announce the findings of a recent regional study that focused on ‘Ed-tech Landscape and Challenges in Asia and MENA’ at the event. (Colombo/Feb19/2024)
