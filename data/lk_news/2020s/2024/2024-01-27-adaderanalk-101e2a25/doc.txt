Lorry topples on Southern Expressway, disrupting traffic

Vehicular movement on the Southern Expressway towards Colombo has been disrupted by a toppled lorry, Ada Derana correspondent says.

The incident took place between the Godagama and Kokmaduwa interchanges a short while ago.

Accordingly, motorists heading to Colombo are urged to use the Kokmaduwa interchange until the stretch of the road is cleared and vehicular movement is restored.
