Sri Lanka’s Pick Me powers JumJum mobike app in Nepal

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka-based ride-sharing company PickMe said it is tying up with Nepal’s FISoft, a fintech company to start a ride sharing app for motorcycles.

“We have done it in a manner that adds value to the Nepali economy, by engaging with an acclaimed Nepalese tech company.”

Motorcycles are in wide use in Nepal accounting for 78 percent of 3.22 million vehicles registered in the country.

“Over the years, PickMe excelled in diversifying their products and services by expanding beyond ride-hailing to being a logistics company and also a pioneer in delivering necessities, especially during crises,” Alejandro Alvarez de la Campa, Country Manager for IFC in Sri Lanka and Maldives said.

“It also became a platform which helped create jobs and new economic opportunities for many, including for women.”

Chairman of PickMe, Ajit Gunewardene said the firm was started 10 year ago, its capacity to go across borders was expected.

“The vision was to provide a service that would be of international standards,” Gunawardana said.

“Over the years, PickMe has diligently forged partnerships across the region, and as we venture into the Kathmandu valley, our aspirations have been realised.

“While there will undoubtedly be a learning curve, it serves as a vital stepping stone towards propelling PickMe to greater heights with expansion into new markets.”
