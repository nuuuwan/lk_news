Google map mishap: Duo who trespassed Temple Trees granted bail

Colombo, March 4 (Daily Mirror) - The Fort Magistrate granted bail to two individuals who mistakenly trespassed into the grounds of Temple Trees in Colombo after following directions on Google maps.

Police said they were arrested by the Kollupitiya Police on Saturday.

According to the police, the two individuals, a software engineer and a merchant seaman, were arrested following the incident.

The duo had reportedly visited a nightclub in Kollupitiya and had consumed liquor before attempting to return to their lodging on Muhandiram Road, relying on Google Maps for navigation.

However, the directions led them to a dead end near the perimeter wall of Temple Trees. In an attempt to find their way, they scaled the wall and inadvertently entered the Temple Trees premises.

During this time, officers from the Prime Minister's Security Division arrested the two individuals and handed them over to the Kollupitiya Police.

They were released on bail after being produced before court.
