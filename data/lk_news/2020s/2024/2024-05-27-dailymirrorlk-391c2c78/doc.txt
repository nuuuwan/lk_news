More sluice gates may be opened if rainfall increases

Colombo, May 27 (Daily Mirror) - If rainfall in the catchment areas increases during the day, it is possible that more sluice gates will need to be opened at various dams and reservoirs, the Irrigation Departmentâ€™s Irrigation (Hydrology) Director Eng. S.P.C. Sugeeshwara Bandara said.

Addressing the media he said 80 percent of water capacity is currently avaliable in all irrigation reservoirs and said this a considerably higher capacity.

"The Deduru Oya in the Kurunegala district and the Tabbowa Wewa in the Puttalam district are currently spilling. Four sluice gates of the Deduru Oya have been opened, releasing water at a rate of 2,800 cubic inches per second. Additionally, two gates of the Tabbowa Wewa have been opened, releasing 800 cubic inches of water per second," he said.

Although the situation is not currently high risk, more rain could necessitate the opening of additional sluice gates, which would pose a significant risk to residents in low-lying areas, he said.

Several other reservoirs have also been reported as spilling, and these could worsen if the catchment areas receive more rainfall throughout the day.

The opening of spill gates at the Kukuleganga Hydro Power Reservoir has been increased to release 80 cubic meters of water per second. This will likely worsen flooding in the low-lying areas of Bulathsinghela.

He also mentioned that higher water levels have been recorded in rivers such as the Kelani and Kalu, which flow through the southwestern provinces.
