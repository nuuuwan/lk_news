In a letter to the Vice Chancellor of the university Prof. Sujeewa Amarasena, the trade unions said: “Throughout the last five years, we have persistently articulated our concerns and pursued resolutions to significant matters impacting the university community. Nonetheless, your inability to respond to these persistent issues has compelled us to insist on immediate measures.”

Furthermore, they stressed that the university is unable to continue accepting the detrimental effects of poor management and the adverse consequences the Vice Chancellor’s leadership has inflicted on its operations, morale, and overall advancement.

“To mitigate additional disturbances and maintain the integrity of the institution, we assert that you still possess the opportunity for a dignified resignation. This would represent a positive advancement for the university, enabling it to recover and prosper under capable and effective leadership”, the letter added.
