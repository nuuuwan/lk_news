X-Press Pearl disaster: Judge recuses himself from considering appeals

Supreme Court Judge S. Thurairaja has recused himself from the judge bench considering the appeals petitions filed by the directors of the local agent of the ‘X-Press Pearl’ ship which caught fire in the seas off Colombo Harbour and resulted in the country’s worst maritime disaster.

The relevant petitions have been filed seeking the suspending of hearing of a criminal case before the Colombo High Court in this regard.

Seven petitions filed by the directors of the Sea Consortium Lanka (Pvt) Ltd., the Sri Lankan agent of the ‘X-Press Pearl’ ship operator were taken up on Tuesday (07) before the three-member Supreme Court judge bench consisting of Justices S. Thurairaja, Janak De Silva and Priyantha Fernando, Ada Derana reported said.

At the time, the chair of the three-member judge panel, Justice S. Thurairaja informed the court that he was recusing him from hearing of the trial due to personal reasons.

Accordingly, the bench also ordered the petitions to be recalled on May 21, before another judge bench.

The managing directors of the local agent of the ship in question had previously filed a revision petition before the Court of Appeal stating that the case filed by the Attorney General against them before the Colombo High Court under the Prevention of Marine Pollution Act regarding the X-Press Pearl ship disaster is unlawful.

However, the Court of Appeal decided to dismiss the petitions without taking them up for hearing.

Accordingly, the managing directors of the company have filed the relevant petitions before the Supreme Court, requesting that the judgment of the Court of Appeal be annulled and an interim order be issued to suspend the hearing of the case against them before the Colombo High Court.
