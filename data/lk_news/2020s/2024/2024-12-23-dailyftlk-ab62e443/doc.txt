Arulsamy appointed Vice President of Democratic People’s Front

The Democratic People’s Front (DPF), a prominent member of the Tamil Progressive Alliance and a key partner of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) coalition, appointed Barath Arulsamy as the party’s new Vice President.

The decision was made during a politburo meeting held in Colombo under the leadership of party Leader MP Mano Ganesan.

The meeting, attended by General Secretary Murugesu Paranitharan, Vice Chair Sasikumar, district organisers from across the country, and senior party members, focused on reviewing the party’s progress and strategies.

Discussions highlighted the party’s impressive performance in the recent Parliamentary Election, where its candidates achieved significant support despite facing challenges. The politburo also deliberated on strategies for the upcoming local Government Council Elections.

Mano Ganesan emphasised the importance of strengthening the party’s organisational structure and preparing for future political contests. As part of this effort, the appointment of Arulsamy was hailed as a step forward in enhancing the party’s political and international engagement.

The DPF, which has played a vital role in advocating for Tamil and minority rights in Sri Lanka, reaffirmed its commitment to addressing the challenges faced by its constituency while working in collaboration with its coalition partners.
