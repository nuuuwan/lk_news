Sri Lanka state minister to arm farmers with air rifles for monkey war

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s State Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said he is giving funds for farmers in his district to acquire air rifles to battle torque monkeys.

Moves to export the torque macaques (Macaca sinica) to China met with fierce resistance from animal rights activists who feared they will be eaten.

Minister Siyambalapitiya had said he will not step back from the decision whatever the pressure that is brought to him.

Money has been allocated to farmer organizations in the Kegalle district through his decentralized budget, he said.

Torque monkeys, along with wild boar, peacocks and elephants are considered as pests by farmers who say they are attacking crops. (Colombo/Feb15/2024)
