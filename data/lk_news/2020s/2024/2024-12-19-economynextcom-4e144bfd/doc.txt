Sri Lanka and India to cooperate on digitalisation

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet of ministers has approved a proposal to sign a memorandum of understanding between the Ministry of Digital Economy of Sri Lanka and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology of India, to cooperate on digitalisation.

This will help “to develop the capacities of officials in the field of digital transformation and promote institutional cooperation between the two countries in the implementation of digital solutions” cabinet spokesman minister Nalinda Jayatissa said.

India as an expert in information technology and digital innovation, Jayatissa said, has the potential to leverage its expertise in areas such as e-Governance, fintech, artificial intelligence and digital infrastructure to aid Sri Lanka’s digitalisation process.

After Sri Lanka’s economic crisis in 2022, many global institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which is offering the island nation an extended fund facility, have strongly recommended the Sri Lankan government to fully digitalise its transactions, including tax claims to reduce human interventions and eventually corruption.
