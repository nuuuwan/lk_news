Education Ministry to reduce weight of school bags

Colombo, Feb 29 (Daily Mirror) - The attention of the Education Ministry has been drawn to reducing the weight of school bags due to the potential risk of causing spinal misalignment or problems for students, Education Ministry Secretary Wasantha Perera said.

She said the decision was announced today after the health authorities had pointed out that students carrying heavy school bags could cause spinal misalignment or other problems to them.

As the first step towards reducing the weight of school bags, the Ministry has decided to print textbooks in batches.

Letting schoolchildren bring only their workbooks except textbooks under the direct supervision of the respective school principals would be an alternative decision, she said.
