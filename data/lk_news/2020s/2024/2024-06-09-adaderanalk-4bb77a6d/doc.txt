Harsha tells CID there is ‘no threats’ to his life

The Criminal Investigations Department (CID) has informed the Speaker of Parliament that SJB MP Dr. Harsha de Silva has said there is no threats to his life and hence an investigation in that aspect is not necessary.

Public Security Minister Tiran Alles on Friday (07) instructed IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon to direct the CID to investigate into the alleged threats the opposition parliamentarian has received.

This was after the Chair of the Committee of Public Finance (COPF), speaking in parliament on the same day, had claimed that he is faced with threats over the inquiry into the controversy surrounding the new visa issuance system.

“…. I addressed intimidation & false accusations during the VFS inquiry. Despite these challenges, my dedication to transparency & accountability remains strong. We’ve accomplished much, including key financial reforms,” de Silva had posted on ‘X’ (formerly Twitter).

The following day, the Criminal Investigation Department had informed the SJB MP that they need to record a statement over his claims of threats against him.

However, in response to this request, while thanking the Minister of Public Security and the CID, the MP has pointed out that the statement he made was a statement made in Parliament under parliamentary privileges, the Police Spokesman’s Office said today.

Also, the MP has informed the police that at that time the Speaker had inquired from him if there was any threat to his life and that he responded saying there was no such threat.

According to the Police Media Division, Dr. Harsha de Silva has further said that there is no need for such an investigation and if it is necessary, they would be informed again.

Accordingly, the Criminal Investigation Department has taken steps to inform the Speaker of Parliament in this regard, the police release said.
