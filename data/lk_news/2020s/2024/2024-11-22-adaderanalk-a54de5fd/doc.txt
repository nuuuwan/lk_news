MP Dilith Jayaweera calls on Malwathu Mahanayake Thero

‘Sarvajana Balaya’ Member of Parliament, Dilith Jayaweera, has emphasized the need to change the prevailing parliamentary system of the opposition opposing all initiatives of the government and to establish a knowledgeable tradition within the legislative framework.

He made these observations during a meeting with the Chief Prelate of the Malwatta Chapter of the Siam Nikaya, Most Venerable Thibbatuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Thero.

Jayaweera worshipped at the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa) during a visit to Kandy today (22), where he also received blessings from the Maha Sangha.

He was accompanied on the visit by the Chairman of ‘Sarvajana Balaya,’ Roshan Ranasinghe, National Organizer Dilum Amunugama, and several others.

They subsequently visited the Malwathu Maha Viharaya, where they paid their respects to the Chief Prelate of the Malwatta Chapter, Most Venerable Thibbatuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Nayaka Thero, and received his blessings.

“We are waiting patiently, allowing time to present the opportunity. This time, the situation is somewhat different. We have continuously called for a change in this tradition.”

“It is essential to transform the opposition’s approach from merely opposing all actions to fostering an knowledgeable tradition. We are working with this perspective. The other thing is preserving our nationalism is extremely important. No nation has achieved development without maintaining its sense of nationalism.”
