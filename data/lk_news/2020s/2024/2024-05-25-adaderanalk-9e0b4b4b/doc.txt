Advisories issued for heavy rains and strong winds

The Department of Meteorology has issued an ‘Amber’ warning for heavy rains in Sabaragamuwa province and in Nuwara-Eliya district today (25).

Due to the southwest monsoon that has established over the island, the prevailing rain and wind conditions are expected to continue further, the Met. Department said.

Heavy showers above 100 mm are likely at some places in Sabaragamuwa province and in Nuwara-Eliya district. Fairly heavy showers about 75 mm are likely at some places in Western and North-western provinces and in Kandy, Galle and Matara districts, it added.

Meanwhile, the Met. Department also issued an advisory for strong winds in the Western slopes of the central hills and Northern, North-central, Western, Southern and North western provinces and in Trincomalee district, effective for the next 24 hours.

Strong winds of about 50-60 kmph can be expected at times over Western slopes of the central hills and in Northern, North-central, Western, Southern and North- western provinces and in Trincomalee district, due to the increase of south-west monsoonal wind flow over the island.

Additionally, fairly strong winds about 30-40 kmph can be expected at times elsewhere of the island.
