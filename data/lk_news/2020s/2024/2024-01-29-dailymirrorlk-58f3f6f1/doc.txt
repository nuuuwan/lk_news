Online Safety Bill will give rise to a fully local social media platform: Hirunika

Colombo, Jan 29 (Daily Mirror) - The Online Safety Bill will give rise to a local social media platform to disseminate information as all foreign online service providers are likely to leave the country once the legislation comes into effect, former MP Hirunika Premachandra said.

“It is just a simple task for the international service providers such as Facebook and X to leave Sri Lanka,” Ms. Premachandra told a media briefing.

“Sri Lanka will have to develop its own platform like China if all foreign service providers stop operations in Sri Lanka,” she added.

“Just imagine what you would feel if you are unable to log onto Facebook, Instagram or X through your phone to be aware of what is happening around the world,” she questioned.
