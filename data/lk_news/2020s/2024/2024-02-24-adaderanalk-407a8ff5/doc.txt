Mahabage shooting: Feeling army soldier arrested over “Ukkuwa’s” murder

A Sri Lanka Army deserter has been arrested by the Army intelligence officers this morning (Feb.24), in connection with the shooting incident in Mahabage earlier this week.

He is said to be one of the prime suspects wanted in the murder case.

According to the Army, the arrestee, named Nuwan Chamara de Silva, was a Corporal attached to the 4th Battalion of the Gemunu Watch Regiment at the camp in Chenkalady, Batticaloa.

He had fled the camp yesterday when the Army intelligence officers were approaching but was later taken into custody in the Ampara area following an extensive search operation.

The suspect was later handed over to the Police Special Task Force (STF) officers for onward investigations.

Three unidentified assailants had opened fire using a revolver, around 7:15 a.m. on Feb.21 near a meat shop in Elapitiwala Junction, Mahabage, leaving the shop owner dead. The victim had succumbed to injuries while being rushed to the Colombo North Teaching Hospital in Ragama.

The deceased was identified as Hettiarachchige Don Sujith alias “Ukkuwa”, the brother-in-law of the criminal gang leader “Welle Saranga” and a resident of North Batagama in Ja-Ela.

The motive behind the shooting was not immediately clear, but a rival gang led by “Dubai Nipuna” was under suspicion of orchestrating the murder. Reports also revealed that Sujith had been receiving death threats from “Dubai Nipuna’s” gang.
