Sajith vows to scrap liquor licenses issued as inducements to politicos

May 16 - Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leader Sajith Premadasa vowed to scrap liquor permits issued recently as inducements under the current government when he gets into power in the future.

Making his remarks at a public meeting, he stressed the need to   form a national movement to rid the country of the menace of   alcoholism. He asserted that such a programme should be implemented targeting school children and parents should unite hands with him.

However, he said he would take certain steps for the promotion of tourism, and that would also be done in terms of a transparent criterion.
