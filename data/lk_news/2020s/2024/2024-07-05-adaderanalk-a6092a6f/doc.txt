Dayasiri assumes duties as SLFP Gen. Sec. ‘outside’ party HQ

MP Dayasiri Jayasekara assumed duties as the General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in front of the party headquarters, claiming that he holds the post.

Jayasekara assumed duties outside the headquarters as he was prevented from entering the building by police.

Meanwhile, a tense situation was reported in front of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party’s Headquarters on Darley Road in Colombo 10, following the arrival of MP Dayasiri Jayasekara this morning (05).

Jayasekara alleges that he is still the legitimate General Secretary of the party, as the Colombo District Court issued an interim order against the SLFP’s decision to expel MP Dayasiri Jayasekara from party membership and the post of General Secretary last week.
