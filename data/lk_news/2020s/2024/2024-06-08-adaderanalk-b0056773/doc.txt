The election to the ECOSOC is Sri Lanka’s 4th consecutive success at a multilateral election. This marks a significant milestone for Sri Lanka’s diplomatic engagement led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its overseas Diplomatic Missions, the statement said.

Established in 1945 by the Charter of the United Nations, the ECOSOC is one of the six principal organs of the UN and serves as the central platform within the UN system to coordinate the economic and social fields, advance international cooperation and development as well as matters relating to the Sustainable Development Goals.
