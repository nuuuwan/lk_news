SLMC cracks whip on Maulana and Harees for disciplinary violations

The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) has removed MP H.M.M Harees from the party’s High Command due to his failure to support and participate in the campaign efforts backing Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leader Sajith Premadasa.

In a letter to Harees yesterday, SLMC Secretary Nizam Kariapper PC noted that the MP had failed to attend a mandatory parliamentary group meeting led by SLMC Leader Rauff Hakeem on 16 August, as well as other campaign-related events, despite clear party directives to do so.

Kariapper said accordingly he has been instructed by Hakeem to notify him of his suspension from the party’s High Command. The SLMC has given Harees until 26 August to submit his response to be considered by the party.

The SLMC has also taken steps to temporarily suspend the party membership of Batticaloa District MP Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana. This action follows his support for President Wickremesinghe, which contradicts the party High Command’s decision to back Sajith Premadasa in the upcoming election.

Informing Moulana of his temporary suspension, SLMC Secretary Nizam Kariapper in a letter noted that the leaders of the SLMC had unanimously decided to support SJB leader Sajith Premadasa at the Presidential Election during the party leaders’ meeting held on 4 August.

He recalled that even though Maulana was not physically present at the meeting, he promised to act according to any decision taken by the party.

“Sri Lanka Muslim Congress leader Rauf Hakeem has informed me that your support for presidential candidate Ranil Wickremesinghe in the 2024 election is a clear violation of both the party’s decision and your pledge,” Kariapper noted.

Moulana has also been granted seven days to respond to the Secretary’s communique.

MP H.M.M. Harees faced a similar suspension in November 2021 after he voted in favour of the budget presented by the Gotabaya Rajapaksa Government. However, the suspension was later lifted and Harees was even appointed as a Deputy Leader of the SLMC.
