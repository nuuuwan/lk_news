Maga Engineering gets Central Highway contracts

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the awarding of the IR and IS contract packages for the Central Highway Project to Maga Engineering Ltd.

The decision was made based on the recommendations of the Standing Procurement Committees appointed by the Cabinet, recognising Maga Engineering Ltd. as the substantially responsive lowest bidder.

The Central Highway Project, which is crucial for improving the countryâ€™s transport infrastructure, has been divided into 19 construction packages under Part Three of the project. Out of these, 17 packages (from 1A to 1Q) have already been awarded to various contractors.

The IR and IS packages, which were the remaining contracts, were put out for competitive bidding among local construction institutions.

Following a thorough evaluation process, the Standing Procurement Committees recommended Maga Engineering Ltd.

The proposal to award these contracts to the company, presented by Transport and Highways Minister Bandula Gunawardena, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
