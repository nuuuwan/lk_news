Sri Lanka to study moving CPC oil refinery to Trinco

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has decided to explore the option of relocating Ceylon Petroleum Corporation’s oil refinery to Trincomalee, Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said.

The cabinet of ministers this week approved a proposal to spin off the refinery as a separate company to raise capital from local and foreign investors to modernize the 1969 structure.

“It was also decided to explore the option of relocating the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery to Trincomalee in the future…,” Minister Wijesekera said in an x.com (twitter) message.

The move is considered in the light of the development of a tank farm in Trincomalee, he said.

The tank farm, dating back to World War II when Sri Lanka was under British rule, and is to be jointly developed with India. (Colombo/Mar19/2024)
