Court issues order on SJB protest

Colombo, Jan 30 (Daily Mirror) - The Colombo Magistrate's Court issued an order prohibiting Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leader Sajith Premadasa and several others from conducting protests that inconvenience the public and disrupt traffic by blocking roads in Maligawatta today.

The Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the Maligawatta Police informed court on plans by a group associated with a political party to initiate a protest march near the Muslim cemetery in Maligawatta and requested an order to prevent the protest.

In response, the magistrate ordered SJB leader Sajith Premadasa, SJB General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara, SJB Chief Organizer of Colombo Central Mujibur Rahman, Apsara Amarasinghe, members of the Samagi Jana Balawega and women's organizations to refrain from obstructing traffic along the route from the Maligawatta Muslim Cemetery to Sangaraja Mawatha via Pradeepa Mawatha, Saddharma Mawatha, Jayantha Weerasekara Mawatha, Milton Perera Mawatha, and Jumma Masjid Junction around the Sangaraja roundabout.
