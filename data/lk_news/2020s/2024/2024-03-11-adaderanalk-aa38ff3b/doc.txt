SriLankan Airlines given 06 months to show progress

Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva has issued a stern directive during a special discussion held at the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation, stressing that SriLankan Airlines must demonstrate operational and financial progress within the next six months.

Failure to do so, he warned, could jeopardize the jobs of approximately 6,000 employees.

In line with the President’s proposal, the government has committed to relieving a portion of the national carriers’ debt, totaling USD510 million out of USD 1.2 billion owed to various banks and institutions.

With a solid financial footing anticipated, the airline has outlined plans for a comprehensive restructuring process within the stipulated timeframe of six months.

To achieve this objective, Minister de Silva emphasized the imperative need to curtail unnecessary expenses and instill robust financial discipline within the company. He urged close collaboration between management and trade unions to accomplish these goals effectively.

In response, company authorities disclosed that the airline currently operates 16 aircraft, facilitating six long-haul and 29 short-haul flights. Additionally, they revealed the acquisition of three Belgian aircraft and one Fit Air aircraft on lease to support operational needs.
