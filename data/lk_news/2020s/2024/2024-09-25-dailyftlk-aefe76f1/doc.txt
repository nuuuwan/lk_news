Ceylon Institute of Builders congratulates new President Anura

The Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB) yesterday extended its warmest wishes to new President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, acknowledging his victory as a pivotal moment for Sri Lanka.

“We hope that our new President and the new Government helps up stand the construction industry, which is made up of a large portion of the country’s workforce and provides employment to the most in-need workers and provides work for small and medium sector entrepreneurs,” the CIOB noted in a statement.

They elaborated that the construction industry is one of the largest industries in Sri Lanka. “Our industry involves around one million direct employees and in totals 2.6 million direct and indirect employees. This industry has a turnover of almost Rs. 1 trillion and has contributed 9.6% to the GDP in the past. If the Government supports the export of our industry, we can easily generate around $ 2 billion into Sri Lanka,” they pointed out. Every rupee in this industry is distributed throughout the lowest levels of society, including labourers and other workmen.

“CIOB has already handed over our roadmap for the year 2024/2025 and the proposal for reviving the construction industry to the NPP. We therefore hope that the President Dissanayake and his new Government gives special attention to the construction industry. We extend our fullest cooperation to provide assistance, initiatives that foster economic growth, innovation and sustainable development,” CIOB added.
