PUCSL yet to receive CEB proposals to slash electricity tariffs

The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is yet to submit the proposals regarding the reduction of electricity tariffs to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), according to PUCSL chairman Prof. Manjula Fernando.

The said proposals were initially expected to be submitted to the PUCSL by the 1st of May.

However, the PUCSL had granted an extension until tomorrow (May 10) in response to a request from the CEB.

Consequently, the PUCSL has instructed the CEB to submit the proposals before the deadline tomorrow.

Prof. Fernando said that after receiving the relevant proposals, the process to reduce the electricity tariffs will be commenced and the percentage of the reduction in the tariff could be announced in the month of July.
