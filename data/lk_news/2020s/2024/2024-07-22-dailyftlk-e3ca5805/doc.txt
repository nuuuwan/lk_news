Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP S.M. Marikkar emphasised the critical need for all Presidential candidates to disclose their economic and debt repayment plans to the public before the upcoming elections.

Speaking at a press conference over the weekend, Marikkar highlighted the severe hardships people are currently facing. Therefore, he urged all candidates to clearly outline their strategies for repaying the country’s debt in the coming year. “They must tell the people if they intend to do it by creating new revenue paths, by increasing taxes, or by obtaining yet more debt,” he said.

Presenting the SJB’s plans to rebuild Sri Lanka, the MP said that after the SJB’s victory, they will convene an international donor conference, attract more investments, increase manufacturing and export revenue, and seek new market opportunities.

“I would like to ask the NPP how it hopes to repay the debt. Is it through bucket collections on the streets, obtaining more debt, or through foreign remittances? I also challenge Ranil Wickremesinghe to reveal the same information without cracking jokes or making insults. He must tell us how he plans to pay the debts. Will it be by increasing prices of goods and services, or by raising taxes?” the MP asked.

Marikkar also challenged the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) to reveal their plans for Sri Lanka’s recovery.

“The people are hoping to elect someone who will ease their lives by reducing taxes and improving the country for their children. The SJB believes in lowering taxes, increasing revenue, and curbing corruption. While some resort to insults and attacks, people are genuinely concerned about what will happen to them and the national debt. The SJB will unveil its comprehensive economic plan next week, covering agriculture, education, exports, investments, and more,” he announced.

“The SLPP and Ranil Wickremesinghe are with those who halted manufacturing and caused a drop in revenues. Anura Kumara Dissanayake is supported by those who can talk but can’t formulate revenue-generating or economic plans. People once took a chance on Gotabaya Rajapaksa and are now facing the consequences. The same groups are now promoting Dissanayake abroad and holding meetings. However, no one from abroad will come to help if things go wrong,” the MP added.

“It is vital for candidates to explain their plans for the economy and debt repayment,” the MP said. “Smart education, smart agriculture, smart city planning, increasing manufacturing, and creating an environment for new markets are all essential. The NPP has no such plan. Their foreign policy might suit North Korea and Cuba, but it is not suitable for developed countries,” he noted.
