The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) says that it has initiated an investigation following a complaint received against former Minister of Health Keheliya Rambukwella, who is currently in remand custody.

The investigation has been launched following a complaint filed by a civilian alleging that two vehicles belonging to the ministry provided to him during his tenure as the Health Minister have not been returned after he resigned from the ministerial position and have been misused.
