Police offer Rs. 5,000 reward for arresting drunk drivers

Colombo, April 12 (Daily Mirror) - Police officers who arrest a drunk driver will receive a reward of Rs. 5,000, the police said today.

Police Spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa said many vehicles have to be checked to arrest a drunk driver and the reward is given to motivate the officer on duty for that purpose.

He said that special police teams have been deployed round the clock to arrest drivers who drive under the influence of alcohol and that special motorcycle teams have also been deployed.

It was reported that at least 150,000 breathalyzer test kits have been provided to all police stations to detect intoxicated drivers.

DIG Thalduwa said the law will be strictly enforced against drivers who drive at high speed, violate traffic rules and drive carelessly when the roads are congested.
