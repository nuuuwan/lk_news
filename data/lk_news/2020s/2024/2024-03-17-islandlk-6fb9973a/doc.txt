Hilton Colombo reveals renovated rooms infused with Lankan heritage

Hilton Colombo proudly unveils its newly refurbished rooms and suites, designed to embrace the rich tapestry of Sri Lanka’s heritage, and are a testament to the country’s vibrant culture and renowned craftsmanship.

The 192 refreshed rooms, including 80 fully renovated Superior Rooms, 96 Deluxe Rooms and 16 Suites feature a refined aesthetic that exudes elevated comfort and a strong sense of place with modern touches, thoughtful design, and expansive views of famous landmarks such as the Colombo Harbor and the Galle Face Green.

“We are thrilled to unveil the next phase of Hilton Colombo’s transformation. Our newly renovated rooms, each designed with our guests’ comfort and satisfaction in mind, reflects our commitment to providing exceptional experiences, merging modern elegance with touches showcasing Sri Lanka’s richly storied heritage. We invite guests to enjoy these refreshed rooms, which not only elevate the aesthetic appeal but also enhance the overall stay experience,” said Manesh Fernando, General Manager Hilton Colombo & Area General Manager Hilton Sri Lanka.

Designed by Singapore-based interior design consultancy FBEYE Singapore and brought to life by local architect Nuwan Dias from NUStudios, the rooms pay homage to the country’s culturally rich heritage with Dumbara-inspired motifs, a nod to the country’s traditional weaving craftmanship, and blends rich teak wood with sleek bronze for a contemporary finish. Closet doors are outfitted with timber veneers, inspired by the island’s lush forestry, and most furniture are carefully curated from local furniture maker Don Carolis.

Drawing inspiration from vast blue skies, deep blue hues are prominent throughout the fabric of the drapery, capturing the majestic beauty of Sri Lanka’s natural landscapes. Each room tells a story of collaboration with indigenous Kandyan artisans and craftsmen.
