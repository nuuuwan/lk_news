Defence Ministry clearance now required for Sri Lankan ex-servicemen to visit Russia

Russia will now require Sri Lanka’s Defence Ministry clearance for visit visas of ex-servicemen, says Foreign Minister Ali Sabry.

The Minister of Foreign Affairs said that he had a constructive meeting with the Russian Ambassador in Colombo, Levan S. Dzhagaryan today (29).

“We addressed the urgent situation of Sri Lankans being deployed in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and agreed on immediate steps to resolve these issues,” he said, in a post on ‘X’ (formerly Twitter).

“Russia will now require Sri Lanka Defence Ministry clearance for visit visas of ex-servicemen.”

He added that the upcoming visit by the Sri Lanka’s State Minister of Foreign Affairs, Tharaka Balasuriya to Russia will enable further discussions to find a solution to this matter.
