TikTok announces specialized workshops program to empower Sri Lankan female entrepreneurs

In commemoration of International Women’s Day 2024, TikTok announced an initiative aimed at empowering female business owners in Sri Lanka. Recognizing the unique challenges faced by women-led businesses in emerging markets, TikTok has designed a specialized workshop program, where informative webinars are designed to provide comprehensive guidance on leveraging the platform for business growth and visibility.

In an era where digital platforms play a central role in organizational success, many small businesses, especially those led by women, encounter significant barriers due to a lack of digital literacy, resources, and support networks. Despite possessing the drive and innovation necessary for success, these barriers often hinder #womeninbusiness from thriving in the competitive online marketplace.

The 20-day workshop program, running from March 1st to March 20th, 2024, will cover key aspects of content creation, strategy building, storytelling, and the effective use of product features on TikTok. The program aims to equip women business owners in Sri Lanka with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in the digital landscape.

Additionally, a webinar featuring industry experts will be held to provide insights into crucial topics such as ‘Strategic Marketing for Women-Owned Businesses’ and ‘The TikTok Advantage: Building Your Brand from the Ground Up.’ The webinar is set to be an engaging platform for participants to gain valuable knowledge about developing and implementing effective marketing campaigns from seasoned professionals in the field.

Through this comprehensive initiative on #womensday, TikTok seeks to bridge the digital divide, foster economic empowerment, and create a supportive ecosystem for women-led businesses in Sri Lanka. Underscoring its commitment to creating positive social impact, TikTok harnesses the transformative power of its platform to champion the cause of women’s economic empowerment, helping female entrepreneurs strive for independence, support their families, and contribute to the Sri Lankan economy.
