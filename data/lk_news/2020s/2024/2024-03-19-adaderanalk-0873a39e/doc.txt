Sri Lanka to import 42 million more eggs from India

The Cabinet of Ministers has green-lighted a proposal seeking permission to award procurement contracts to import more eggs from India, based on the recommendations of the Standing Procurement Committee.

As such, 42 million more eggs are to be brought into Sri Lanka, as per a Cabinet approval granted in December 2023.

On 18 December last year, the Cabinet of Ministers gave the nod to import eggs from India until 30 April 2024 in a bid to maintain stable prices in the local market and to provide the products at reasonable rates to the consumers.

After receiving the approval, Sri Lanka has thus far imported as many as 18 million eggs from its neighbor and 42 million more eggs are planned to be brought in.

For this purpose, the Department of Animal Production and Health has already called proposed rates from the recommended Indian companies. Accordingly, a proposal tabled by the President to award relevant procurement contracts to import Indian eggs was green-lighted by the Cabinet.
