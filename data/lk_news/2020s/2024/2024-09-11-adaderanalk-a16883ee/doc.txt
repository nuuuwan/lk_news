Dilith urges voters not to base decision on ‘artificially created’ rallies

The presidential candidate of the ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ alliance, entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera, called on the public not to base their final decision on artificially created political rallies.

He made these remarks during a meeting held this morning (11) to present appointment letters to several electoral organizers of the ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ alliance

He stated that Sri Lanka has reached the final stage of the presidential election, regarding which the people of the country had placed immense expectations and hope.

“We attempted to control our expenses and try to make this communication efficient, as advised by the Election Commissioner,” he said.

He stated that is the reason why they didn’t use buses to pull crowds to meetings or use drone cameras to show the crowds. He added that if anyone thinks that the people who attended those meetings with large crowds are actual voters, they are completely mistaken.

Jayaweera further pointed out that a certain group of people have created a small enterprise to attend  political meetings across the country. Therefore, he suggested that people should not look at these crowds and decide as to  where the ‘wave’ is.

“Final survey reports are being received. We observe a tendency that people go to the ballot box and use both their heart and intelligence to make a decision,” he added.
