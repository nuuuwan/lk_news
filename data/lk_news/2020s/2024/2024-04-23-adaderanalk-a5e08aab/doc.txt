Police return fire at armed men inside defiant three-wheeler; two dead

Two individuals have died after the police opened fire at a three-wheeler that failed to comply with police orders to pull over. The incident took place in Moragahahena on early Saturday morning (23).

According to the police, the armed men who were travelling in the three-wheeler had fired shots at the officers who signalled them to stop at the checkpoint in Beruketiya Junction in Meegoda.

After being alerted of the situation, the officers of Western Province (South) Crimes Division who were on duty in Moragahahena had spotted the speeding the vehicle and signalled it to stop.

The officers began to chase the three-wheeler down, as it defied police orders the second time and sped off. But the vehicle had veered off the roadÂ amidst the high-speed police chase.

After the three-wheeler came to a stop, one individual who popped out of the three-wheeler had opened fire at the approaching police jeep.

When the officers retaliated, two men who were inside the three-wheeler were shot and they succumbed to injuries while being rushed to the Horana hospital.

The third individual who was travelling in the three-wheeler has meanwhile escaped.

The deceased were identified as Imesh Danushka Darshana (36) and Suraj Prabodha Aadhihetti (42). Both of them had previous criminal records, according to the police.

Darshana, implicated in multiple robberies and drug peddling, was reportedly an army deserter and a wanted criminal. Meanwhile, Prabodha, who had previously been arrested on drug charges, was reportedly an accomplice in a shooting incident reported in August 2023. Following his arrest in February this year, the suspect had been released on bail on 18 March.

Police said the pistol used by the suspects was recovered in the vicinity of the three-wheeler.
