Injunction issued preventing Upul Tharangaâ€™s arrest

The Court of Appeal has issued an interim injunction preventing the execution of an arrest warrant issued against the Chairman of the Selection Committee at Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), former Sri Lankan cricketer Upul Tharanga.

A two-member Appeals Court judge bench issued the injunction today (16), after considering a writ petition filed by Upul Tharanga, Ada Derana reporter said.

On October 08, the Matale High Court issued an arrest warrant against the Chairman of the Selection Committee at Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), former Sri Lankan cricketer Upul Tharanga over failure to appear before the court pertaining to a match-fixing case during the 2024 Legends Cricket Tournament.

However, the relevant case has been filed by Tharanga himself and he had left the country at the time for cricketing purposes without informing the court in that regard.
