June 05 - While reaffirming the strong bilateral ties between the two countries, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry on Wednesday said he held discussions with his Maldivian counterpart Moosa Zameer, to revisit the limits imposed on foreign currency remittances of Sri Lankan migrant workers in the Maldives.

The discussions were part of the four-day official visit undertaken by Zameer who was scheduled to meet President Ranil Wickremesinghe today before concluding his visit tomorrow.

“I welcome the Maldives commitment in providing employment opportunities for Sri Lanka and express hope that the two countries will work on a government-to-government recruitment process. I also requested the Maldivian side to consider revisiting the current limit imposed on outward foreign currency remittances, for the benefit of the Sri Lankan migrant workers, in the Maldives,” Sabry said following bilateral talks with the Maldivian Foreign Minister.

Sabry also said that he invited investment from the Maldives in the hospitality, fisheries and food processing industries in Sri Lanka.
