Opposition leader’s proposal raises doubts over MPs’ loyalty amid liquor license issue

Colombo, May 14 (Daily Mirror) - If the MPs who have applied for liquor licenses are to face punishment, as the Opposition Leader suggests, it raises suspicions on how many MPs will remain loyal to him, Finance State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

Addressing the media, he said no arrangements have been made to provide liquor licenses to any of the parliamentarians' friends or acquaintances. The Opposition Leader claimed no such project was launched, but he repeats that over and over again.

"Based on the reported population data, liquor licenses were issued 16 years ago. The government's approach doesn't involve promoting the use of legal alcohol; instead, it focuses on regulation through tax hikes and implementing new license fees. The overarching goal seems to be enhancing state revenue while simultaneously curbing the proliferation of illegal alcohol," the State mMnister said.

"The Opposition Leader's suggestion, requesting the names of all company directors who have applied for liquor licenses, doesn't hide anything. However, obtaining this list requires specific requests and may involve a separate process. The Excise Department has stated that compiling this list will take several days," he said.

As requested by the Leader of the Opposition, the report on the boards of directors of the companies that have applied for liquor licenses will be prepared and presented during the next parliamentary session, Siyambalapitiya said.
