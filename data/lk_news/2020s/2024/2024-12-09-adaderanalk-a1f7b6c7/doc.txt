Train delays reported on coastal line

The Department of Railways has reported train delays on the coastal line, due to a damaged track between Mount Lavinia and Ratmalana railway stations.

Accordingly, this has resulted in trains arriving at Colombo Fort being delayed.

However, the department further stated that all office trains operating up to Colombo Fort operated on schedule without any delays.
