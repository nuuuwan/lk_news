‘Namal has more time to run for presidency’ – Mahinda Rajapaksa

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa says he is confident that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will resolve its internal issues soon.

In response to questions raised by journalists in Anuradhapura today (07), the former President also mentioned that the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) forming an alliance together with former members of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is not a challenge.

“We have no problem even if ten alliances are formed. It is good that our people [members of SLPP] are everywhere [in the alliances].”

Rajapaksa, who also commented regarding the SLPP’s presidential candidate, claimed that the party will definitely name a candidate for the Presidential Election and that a final decision regarding the candidate will be taken following discussions with the SLPP’s active members.

“Definitely, they will name a candidate. We didn’t summon them [party members] as of yet. We’ll take a decision after holding discussions with them.”

Commenting on reports of naming MP Namal Rajapaksa as the presidential candidate, the former President expressed that his son still has more time to run for the presidency.
