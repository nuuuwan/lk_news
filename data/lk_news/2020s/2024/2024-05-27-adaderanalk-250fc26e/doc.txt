The deadline for submitting applications for the 2024/2025 scholarship program, jointly offered by the Sri Lanka Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRCSL) and the President’s Fund for students studying Information and Communication Technology at the G.C.E Advanced Level has been extended until June 07, 2024.

As the awarding of these scholarships needs to be done promptly, students who have met the qualifications should properly complete their applications, the PMD reported.

These applications must be recommended by the Grama Seva Officer, Divisional Secretary, class teacher, school principal, and zonal director.

The completed applications should then be sent by registered post only to the Secretary, President’s Fund, No. 35, 3rd Floor, Lakehouse Building, DR Wijewardena Mawatha, Colombo 10, before the specified date.

The name of the relevant scholarship program and the educational zone to which the school belongs should be mentioned in the top left corner of the envelope, the statement said.

The acceptance of applications for this scholarship program was initially set to end on the 22nd of May. However, due to numerous requests from students who faced various administrative issues and bad weather conditions, the deadline has been extended, it said.
