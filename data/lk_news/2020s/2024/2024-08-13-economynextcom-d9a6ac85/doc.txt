Five Malaysian Universities in Sri Lanka to target more students for degrees

ECONOMYNEXT – Five Malaysian Universities have arrived in Sri Lanka to promote their courses and target the island nation’s students for degrees and other higher education qualifications.

Sri Lanka is in the top 10 countries with the highest applications to study in Malaysia, based on the latest data from Education Malaysia Global Services (EMGS), a Company Limited by Guarantee (CLBG) under the purview of the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia.

After an unprecedented economic and foreign exchange crisis in 2022, Sri Lanka has been considering becoming a regional hub for education in order to cut foreign exchange outflow of the country as more students go abroad for higher education.

Sri Lanka banned dollar payments in mid-2022 to contain the dollar outflows from the country after it faced a severe shortage of forex following the rupee being floated in March 2022.

Sri Lanka has been spending around $3 billion for those who spend for education from foreign countries.

Sri Lanka has been in the process of opening up several new universities including in Kurunegala and Batticaloa districts as well as giving national status for private institutions such as NIBM and SLIIT to speed up the reforms in the country’s higher education system.

The government is also focusing on advancing the education system and facilitating the establishment of foreign branch universities, particularly focusing on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) subjects.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe in the revised 2022 budget offered to provide scholarships to Sri Lankan students to study in foreign university branches with an aim to maintain free education for needy people. His government has also been in the process of allowing foreign universities to open their branches with affiliation of local higher education institutions.

Representatives from Asia Pacific University, Nilai University, Raffles University, Segi University, and University of CyberJaya are in Sri Lanka in search of potential students with a range of courses including medicine, engineering, information technology, and science.

The EMGS has organized an exclusive ‘Study in Malaysia Education Fair’ series for Sri Lankan students who are looking for study abroad opportunities along with the five University representatives with Mway Pvt Ltd being the local event partner.

The education fairs are scheduled in Negombo, Colombo, and Kandy from August 12-15. (Colombo/August 13/2024)
