Sri Lanka positive growth momentum to continue: CB Governor

ECONOMYNEXT – There are clears signs in leading indicators that Sri Lanka’s positive growth seen in the early part of 2024 will continue, with low inflation and the exchange rate also stable, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.

In the first quarter of 2024 Sri Lanka’s economy grew 5.3 percent, according to an estimate by the state statistics office.

“Subsequent to the strong positive growth in the first part of this year, leading indicators point to a continuation of this positive growth momentum during the of the remainder this year,” Governor Weerasinghe told participants of an  international forum organized by the Insurance Association of Sri Lanka.

“External sector stability has been restored to a great extent.”

Sri Lanka started to show positive growth with inflation falling and the exchange rate ‘broadly stable’ which has also allowed the central bank to lower policy rates.

During the last currency crisis, the insurance sector also suffered, he said.

Insurers faced difficulties in paying re-insurance premiums and there were difficult choices to be made, with fuel and other goods in short supply he recalled.

Last year interest rates were high giving strong investment returns but now rates were falling.

The insurance sector had opportunities in the medical sector as well as well as with an ageing population.

By providing long-term credit, insurance firm can help in the recovery of the economy, Governor Weerasinghe said.

Governor Weerasinghe said he would like to see more involvement in the insurance sector in agriculture. (Colombo/Aug14/2024)
