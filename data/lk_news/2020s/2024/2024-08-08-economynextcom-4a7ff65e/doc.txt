Sri Lanka should introduce IT education early: Sajith

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s should teach Information Technology (IT) to school children of all ages, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa has said.

“I fervently believe that ICT should be taught from Grade 1 to 13. And we will make it a compulsory subject and we will ensure that teaching takes place in the English language,” Premadasa told a forum at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute.

Premadasa advocated teaching IT for school children of all ages and promoted an educational foster parent scheme where donors become ‘foster parents’ to schools by providing resources and funds to schools.

“Information technology remains to be a subject that is taught only from Grade 6,” Premadasa said.

Sri Lanka’s Education Ministry confirmed that information technology is a compulsory subject from Grade 6 onwards. It is not taught as a subject from Grades 1 to 5.

“We do not teach ICT as a subject in the primary grades, however, we do allow children to use the computer for other subjects,” Ministry of Education Director of Education Reform, Poorna Perera, told EconomyNext.

“It is not that the Ministry of Education does not want to teach children computing, but there are concerns from doctors and healthcare professionals on exposing children to computers from a young age.” (Colombo/Aug8/2024)
