SL-Russia set to enhance transport cooperation via MoU

The Cabinet of Ministers approved signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Transport and Highways Ministry in Sri Lanka and Transport Ministry of Russia to improve transport staff training and development.

The said agreement which aims to enhance staff training and development within the transport industry is pending clearance from the Attorney General’s Department for the draft MoU.

Discussions surrounding the importance of establishing the MoU between the two Ministries gained momentum during the recent official visit of the Transport and Highways Minister Banduala Gunawardena to Russia.

“Both countries acknowledged the significance of enhancing greater cooperation to advance mutual interests in transport-related endeavours,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Gunawardena said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing on Tuesday.

The proposal put forth by Transport and Highways Minister Gunawardena was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers at its meeting on Monday.
