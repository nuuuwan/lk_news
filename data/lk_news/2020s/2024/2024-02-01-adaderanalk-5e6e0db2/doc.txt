Malwathu Mahanayake Thero comments on new social media laws

The Chief Prelate (Mahanayake Thero) of the Malwathu Chapter Most Ven. Thibbatuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangalabhidhana Thero states that there is no fault in introducing new laws to control the various abuses that are being perpetrated on social media by altering the truth, for a long time.

The Mahanayake Thero made this remark when a group of representatives of the International Human Rights Organization visited Maha Nayaka Thero today (Feb. 01).

Speaking further, Ven. Thibbatuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangalabhidhana Thero expressed that some groups of people defamed him as well on social media in the past with no basis.

However, the Mahanayake Thero further added that people who use social media should have no hindrances in using them freely, adding that if the government regulates social media without political objectives, people will not oppose the relevant regulations.
