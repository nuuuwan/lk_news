Sri Lanka Police strengthens measures against money laundering and terrorism financing

Sri Lanka Police has reached agreements with various government and semi-government institutions in order to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism.

These agreements will facilitate the swift exchange of crucial information necessary for police investigations.

Accordingly, the relevant agreements have already been finalized with key institutions, including the Department of Motor Traffic, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission, the Central Environment Authority, and the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and Sri Lanka Customs.

The primary objective of these agreements is to establish a streamlined process for sharing information pertinent to investigations into money laundering and funding the terrorism. This initiative is expected to significantly reduce delays that have impeded the timely acquisition of essential data for police investigations.

Furthermore, Sri Lanka Police emphasized that interactions with a team of officers with extensive experience in relevant fields will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of these operations enabling a more robust and rapid response to financial crimes and terrorism-related activities.
