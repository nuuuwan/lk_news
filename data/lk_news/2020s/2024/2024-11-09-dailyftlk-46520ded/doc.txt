Agora’24: An exciting blend of Greek mythology and traditional Sri Lankan culture

Agora’24, the annual talent show organised by the first-year undergraduates of the University of Kelaniya’s Department of Finance (DFIN), will be happening for the third consecutive time on 9 November.

Held at the prestigious Sri Dharmaloka Hall, Agora’24 will be an evening of captivating performances, including traditional dances, 90s singing, baila, and drama, showcasing the diverse talents of the DFIN freshmen. The event is a project by the first-year batch as part of a course module for their skills development. Each act has been meticulously shaped by the talented freshmen, who have put much effort into making their performances special.

Agora’24 is a place where talent meets adventure, showcasing the creativity, teamwork, and talent of the freshmen of DFIN. This year’s theme, ‘Experience the Odyssey of Flavour’ is an exciting blend of Greek mythology and traditional Sri Lankan fantasy and culture.

Michelle Dilhara, a prominent Sri Lankan actress, environmentalist, author, social activist, and philanthropist who has won many national awards for her acting and influential work, will be the Chief Guest for the day.

The Guest of Honour is Retired Professor Chitra Ranjani, who recently retired after a remarkable 40-year career, whose invaluable contribution has not only shaped the academic journey but also elevated the department to new heights.

With an expected audience of 800 which includes the lecturers and undergraduates of the university, this event is expected to be a resounding success. The programs are planned to wow the audience through the talent of the performing students as well as all the undergraduates who planned and organised the event as part of their training.
