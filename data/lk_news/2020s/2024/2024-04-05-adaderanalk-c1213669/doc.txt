Mobile phone prices dropped significantly, dealers say

The prices of mobile phones in Sri Lanka have dropped by 18% - 20%, says the Sri Lanka Mobile Phone Importers’ and Sellers’ Association.

The president of the association Samith Senarath made these remarks while joining a press briefing this evening (05).

This price drop comes as a result of the continuous appreciation of Sri Lankan Rupee against US Dollar, he explained.
