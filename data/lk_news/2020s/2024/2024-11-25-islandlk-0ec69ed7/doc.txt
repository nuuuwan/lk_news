Melwa empowers Sri Lanka’s construction sector with skills-building workshops

Melwa, Sri Lanka’s leading steel wire manufacturer, organised a workshop on the construction industry for Technical Officers (TOs) in the Anuradhapura District. This workshop took place on 7 November at the Mango Hotel in Anuradhapura, with nearly 100 TOs in attendance.

Additionally, Melwa held a special training programme for welders on 9 November at Muthu Villa Hotel in Walasmulla. The programme aimed to enhance the professional skills of welders in the construction industry and provide them the nationally recognised National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) Level 03 certification. Nearly 200 welders participated in this programme, organised with full support from Melwa Company.

At the end of the programme, all participants received a valuable certificate from Melwa, and the company provided additional training and financial support for a select group of welders to obtain the NVQ Level 03 certificate awarded by the National Vocational Training Authority (NVTA). Melwa had also arranged for each participant to receive a valuable set of equipment.
