Two women were rescued by police and lifeguards after being swept away by strong river currents while bathing in the Amban Ganga.

The incident had reportedly occurred in the Moragolla area following the opening of the sluice gates at the Bowatenna Reservoir in Naula.

According to reports, the water levels surged unexpectedly, sweeping the two women away while they were bathing in the river. Naula Police had then taken immediate steps to control the water flow from the reservoir and rescued the two women with the help of police lifeguards.

The women, aged 20 and 25, are residents of Kongahawela and Kagama areas, police said.
