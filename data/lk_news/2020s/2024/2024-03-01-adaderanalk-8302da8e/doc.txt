United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Asia Pacific Regional Director Pio Smith has called on Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena at the Temple on Thursday (February 29).

The Premier thanked the UNFPA for the support extended during the past 50 years to several areas including the plans to modernize Sri Lanka’s statistical system and upgrade population data system.

The UPFPA Regional Director assured continuous support to upgrade data systems to move towards the digital economy.

Mr. Smith expressed interest in assisting programmes to enhance collaboration at the national level and advocate for the rights of women and girls. He said he visited Kilinochchi on Wednesday to assess the issues faced by communities at the grassroots level and there he noted with satisfaction the measures taken with regard to gender violence at homes and outside.

UNFPA Sri Lanka sustains its enduring collaboration with the Sri Lankan government and diverse stakeholders country-wide, driving progress in health, education, and gender equality.

PM Gunawardena said that the support provided to strengthen comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services, encompassing family planning and maternal and neonatal healthcare was highly appreciable.

UNFPA Regional Director lauded Sri Lanka’s comprehensive approach to reproductive health and family planning ensuring accessible information and services to enable informed decision-making.

The Prime Minister said the UNFPA’s initiation of mobile health clinics to deliver comprehensive maternal and reproductive health services in rural areas and supply maternity and dignity kits to pregnant women and girls ensuring access to essential items in times of crisis were immensely beneficial to the villagers.
