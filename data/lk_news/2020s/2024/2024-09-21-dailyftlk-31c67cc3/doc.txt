SLPP suspends party membership of three MPs

The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has suspended the party membership of three Members of Parliament.

They are Anuradhapura District MP S.M. Chandrasena, Ratnapura District MP Pavithra Wanniarachchi and Kalutara District MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena.

Their party membership has been suspended for going against the SLPP Politburo’s decision to support the party’s Presidential candidate, which was taken at its meeting held on 29 July.

The statement further says that the three MPs’ membership in SLPP’s All-Island Working Committee, the Executive Committee, and Politburo have also been suspended.
