Cabinet Spokesman Minister Vijitha Herath assured that legal action will be taken against those involved in orchestrating and leading the Easter Sunday terror attacks.

In response to a question raised by a journalist during today’s (08) Cabinet press conference regarding the government’s approach to the ongoing investigation, Minister Herath noted that a special probe is in place on how certain parts of the investigation committee’s report went missing.

“We have initiated a special inquiry to uncover the full truth behind the Easter attack. We are investigating how certain parts of the committee’s [committee appointed to inquire into the attacks] report went missing, including how pages were lost during the process. The investigation is progressing according to procedure, and we are committed to providing the people with answers”, he said.

The minister acknowledged the delays in the inquiry but emphasized the government’s determination to pursue justice, stating “It is taking time because we want to ensure that the investigation is thorough and transparent. We will inform the public about the findings.”

Reaffirming the government’s stance on enforcing the law, Minister Herath said, “We are making very strict decisions to hold accountable those who were involved and led this attack. The law will be implemented without fail. We are not working to cover anything up—we want to give the people confidence that justice will be served.”
