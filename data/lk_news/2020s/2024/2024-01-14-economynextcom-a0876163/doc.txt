Sri Lanka has to pay costs of scrapping LRT to re-start Japan loans opposition says

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has to pay the costs of scrapping an light rail transit project and also complete debt restructuring to re-start Japanese projects, opposition legislator Harsha de Silva said after meeting visiting Japanese Finance Minister Suzuki, Shunichi.

The message given at a meeting with opposition leader Sajith Premadasa was to “complete the debt restructure”, not to jeopardise a program with the International Monetary Fund and to re-start stalled projects “must repay due for LRT cancellation” de Silva said in a message over x, a social media platform.

Japan halted its loan funded projects after Sri Lanka defaulted, as its lending agency is barred from increasing loans to a country in debt distress.

Sri Lanka defaulted on its external debt in 2022, after printing money to cut rates and target ‘potential output’ (macro-economic policy) after the end of a civil war under a ‘flexible’ inflation targeting regime triggering serial currency crisis and a steady spike in foreign debt.

In 2020 tax cuts were added to record money printing to cut cuts, in yet another attempt to push up growth after what state macro-economists claimed was a ‘persistent output gap’.

At the time targeting potential output by printing money was not legal. It has now been legalized under an IMF backed law. The International Monetary Fund gave technical assistance to calculate potential output. (Colombo/Jan14/2024)
