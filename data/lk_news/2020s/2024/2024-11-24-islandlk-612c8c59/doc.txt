ComBank and Hayleys Solar donate solar power system to VT centre, temple in Tissamaharama

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon and Hayleys Solar recently donated a photovoltaic solar panel power supply system for the use of the Sri Kavantissa Vocational Training Centre in Tissamaharama and the Tissamaharama Raja Maha Vihara.

The 40kW on-grid solar power system benefits the students receiving vocational training at the centre as well as devotees from all around the island that visit the temple, and helps the two institutions to reduce their electricity costs.

The donation by the two companies flows from a strategic collaboration between Commercial Bank and Hayleys Solar to provide concessionary terms under the Bank’s ‘Diribala Green Development Loan’ scheme for businesses to purchase solar power systems from Hayleys Solar with a number of exclusive benefits.

Pictured here at the donation of the solar power system are Commercial Bank Managing Director/CEO Sanath Manatunge, the Bank’s Chief Operating Officer S. Prabagar, Hayley’s Solar Managing Director/ CEO Hasith Premathilake and the Director General of the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission Dr K. A. Lalithadheera unveiling the commemorative plaque.
