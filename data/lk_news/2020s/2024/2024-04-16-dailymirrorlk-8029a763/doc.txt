Street food vendor arrested for verbally harassing foreigner

Colombo, April 16 (Daily Mirror) - Following a contentious verbal exchange involving YouTuber Emeka Iwueze, a Sri Lankan street food vendor accused of charging an excessive amount for a Kottu Roti dish was apprehended by the police.

According to a video shared on Emeka Iwueze's official YouTube channel, the American visitor to Sri Lanka embarked on a culinary exploration of the country's street food scene five days prior, aiming to familiarize himself with local cuisine.

During his outings, Iwueze would stroll through the streets, sampling various dishes and engaging in friendly conversations with locals to better understand the culture and social dynamics.

After trying several food items, Iwueze entered a food stall where the vendor introduced offerings such as string hopper Kottu, seafood, and chicken Kottu. Upon selecting a spicy fish Kottu, Iwueze inquired about the price, only to be quoted Rs. 1,900 by the vendor. However, the situation escalated when the owner abruptly halted the order and brusquely instructed Iwueze to leave if he wasn't interested.

In a tense exchange, the vendor defended the pricing, invoking religious sentiments and asserting their honesty. Despite Iwueze's attempts to peacefully resolve the situation, he was ultimately forced to leave by the owner's threats.
