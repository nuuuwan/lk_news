Afternoon thundershowers anticipated in some areas despite extreme heat

Showers or thundershowers are expected at a few places in the Western, Sabaragamuwa and North-western provinces and in Galle and Matara districts after 2.00 p.m. today (06), the Department of Meteorology says.

Hence, the members of the public are urged to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.

The department also issued a heat index advisory, warning that the temperature felt on the human body is likely to increase up to ‘Caution Level’ in parts of the Northern, North-Central, Eastern, Western, Sabaragamuwa, North-western and Southern provinces as well as in Matale, Monaragala districts today.

As per the advisory, under this level of temperature, fatigue is possible with prolonged exposure and activity while continuing activity could result in heat cramps.

According to the department, on the apparent northward relative motion of the sun, it is going to be directly over the latitudes of Sri Lanka from 05 to 15 April this year. The nearest areas of Sri Lanka over which the sun is overhead today are Lellopitiya, Balangoda, Bulathsinhala, Kalthota and Wadduwa.
