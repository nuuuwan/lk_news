Fuel price revision a gimmic to mislead people, can reduce by a maximum of Rs. 200

Colombo, March 6 (Daily Mirror) - While reducing the prices of Lanka Super Diesel 4 Star Euro 4 and Lanka Petrol 95 Octane Euro 4, the government has played a small gimmic on the people, former Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) Commissioner Janaka Ratnayaka said.

Addressing the media yesterday, he said the recent fuel price revision has misled the people.

Reducing the fuel prices by Rs. 9 and Rs. 10 is of no use to the people. As he had mentioned in 2022, the fuel prices can be reduced by a maximum of Rs. 200, he added.

Ratnayake claimed that the fuel prices published on the official page on X, officially known as Twitter, by the Power and Energy Minister were wrong and that their formula was also wrong.

"If we calculate the fuel prices according to the trends of the world market, the fuel prices can be reduced by a maximum of Rs. 200.

"The people and civil organisations have the right to fulfill their demands by forcing the government to do so. The government is making decisions according to the requirements of the IMF," he charged.
