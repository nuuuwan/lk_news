Sri Lanka bans corporal punishment for children

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will ban corporal punishment in all spheres, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said.

“The Cabinet approved amendments to the Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code to prohibit corporal punishment in all spheres,” Wickremesinghe said on X.

This “Paves the way for legal protections to ensure that no child in Sri Lanka suffers physical or mental violence, aligning with our commitment to safeguard the rights and well-being of every child.”

Sri Lanka allows corporal punishment under section 341 of the Penal Code which makes exceptions for a schoolmaster while section 82 of the Penal Code makes exceptions for an ‘act done in good faith for the benefit of a child or person of unsound mind, by or by consent of guardian.’

However, this has long been considered as a violation of human rights with article 19 of the United Nations Conventions of the Rights of the Child, prohibiting all forms of violence towards children. (Colombo/Apr30/2024)
