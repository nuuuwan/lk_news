Cabinet nod to adopt comprehensive National Anti-Corruption Agenda

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the adoption of the anti-corruption agenda as the national agenda for the Government, directing all authorities to adhere to this comprehensive framework.

Since the Government took office in July 2022, it has prioritised improving governance, eradicating corruption, restoring State finances, ensuring credit sustainability and revitalising the economy.

The foundation of the National Agenda for Anti-Corruption was established through the enactment of the Anti-Corruption Act No. 9 of 2023. This Act consolidates the Anti-Corruption Act (Authority 26), the Bribery and Corruption Commission Act No. 19 of 1994 and the Assets and Liabilities Statement No. 1 of 1975, aligning with international standards such as the United Nations Convention on Anti-Corruption and the Financial Action Task Force guidelines.

In addition, a draft Bill on properties acquired through criminal activities is nearing completion. According to the report on the legal, organisational and strategic framework for anti-corruption in the International Monetary Fund’s technical assistance evaluation, 16 key actions have been identified for the national anti-corruption agenda. These include:

4. Establishing a productive and transparent system for asset statements and conflict of interest procedures.

5. Introducing new methods for handling assets from crimes and money laundering.

7. Amending the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007 and other measures to enhance the legal framework on beneficial ownership.

9. Declaring all companies receiving tax relief through the Strategic Development Project Act No. 14 of 2008 and the Board of Investment.

10. Suspending the Strategic Development Projects Act No. 14 of 2008 until a clear and transparent process for evaluating investment promotion conditions and proposals is established.

13. Establishing a new management methodology for the Employees Provident Fund.

14. Amending laws, regulations, and procedures for financial supervision in the banking sector.

“The comprehensive anti-corruption agenda represents a significant step forward in Government’s efforts to combat corruption and improve governance, aiming to build a more transparent and accountable State,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.
