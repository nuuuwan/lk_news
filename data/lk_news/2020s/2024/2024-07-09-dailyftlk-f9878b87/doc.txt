Ceylon Chamber and MDF partner to empower women business development coaches

Aiming to advance gender inclusivity and promote women’s economic empowerment, The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in collaboration with MDF Training and Consultancy successfully concluded a Training of Trainers (ToT) program designed to enhance the capabilities of women business development coaches in Sri Lanka.

Titled “Building the Capacity of Women Business Development Coaches in Sri Lanka,” the program was conducted in two intensive sessions, with 30 coaches participating. The program is designed to cultivate a dynamic network of women trainers who can support and mentor women entrepreneurs, thereby strengthening the ecosystem for women entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka.

During the two batches, the 30 selected coaches received in-depth training in topics including women’s entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka, e-commerce, environmentally sustainable businesses, digital marketing, and business coaching skills and planning, aimed to develop practical coaching skills and effective planning strategies to support and mentor women entrepreneurs successfully.

The Ceylon Chamber will leverage these trained coaches to organise additional business coaching sessions specifically for women. By working with those who have already been trained, the initiative will foster a self-sustaining cycle of empowerment and development within the community.

Women entrepreneurs often encounter significant challenges, including limited access to resources, networks, and mentorship opportunities. This program aims to address these gaps by building a network of capable women business coaches, who can provide women entrepreneurs with the tools, knowledge, and support they need to thrive.

The trained coaches will demonstrate their newly acquired skills at a showcasing event organised by the Ceylon Chamber on 25 July, at the Hatch premises.
