People who had already visited Sri Lanka, also visited the stalls and shared their warm and fond memories of their travels in the country.

Sri Lankan arts and craft; wooden masks; soft toys; jewelry; batik, reed and brassware products available in the stalls were much sought after with Sri Lankan tea and food being the centre of attraction. The visitors were treated to a wide variety of authentic Sri Lankan cuisine including yellow rice and curry, string hoppers, egg hoppers, kottu, kokis, jackfruit cutlets, vadai and many more.

Children from the Sri Lankan community in The Netherlands mesmerized the crowds with their Sri Lankan dance performance and added color and excitement, with their traditional costumes to the event.
