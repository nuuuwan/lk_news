University non-academic staff end strike

The Executive Grade of the non-academic staff of universities have decided to call off their ongoing strike following discussions with relevant authorities.

The trade unions have ended the strike after discussing their demands and reaching an agreement with the Chairman of the University Grants Commission (UGC) Prof. Sampath Amarathunga.

Non-academic employees from 17 universities and 19 joint post-graduate institutions have been on strike for nearly 70 days, severely disrupting the countryâ€™s higher education sector.

The trade union action was launched based on several demands including wage concerns and allowances which they say were approved in 2017.
