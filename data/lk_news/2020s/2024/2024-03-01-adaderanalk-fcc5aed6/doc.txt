Sapugaskanda refinery temporarily shut in July for ‘major turnaround’

The daily operations of Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery will be temporarily halted for 45 days starting this July for a major turnaround (TAR), the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) announced on Friday (March 01).

In a statement, the CPC said this essential maintenance and repair process is mandatory, in compliance with international norms, to ensure safe and reliable operations at the refinery for three more years.

Sapugaskanda oil refinery’s previous TAR took place in February 2021.

Once the facility resumes functions after the pre-planned extensive maintenance and repair operation, the CPC said it will be subjected to upgrades designed to boost its contribution to Sri Lanka’s changing product requirements.

During the period the refinery remains shut, the CPC will maintain a buffer stock of refined products to ensure an uninterrupted supply.
