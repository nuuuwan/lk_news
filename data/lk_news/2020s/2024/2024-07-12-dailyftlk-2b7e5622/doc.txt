Global textiles sourcing exhibition, 15th Intex in Colombo from 7-9 Aug.

The premier international textile sourcing platform in South Asia returns to Colombo for its 10th edition.

This year, Intex Sri Lanka which will be held on 7-8-9 August 2024, is expanding across four halls at BMICH to support the industry to achieve the $ 8 billion garment export target by 2025. This dedicated trade show empowers Sri Lankan businesses to widen their product range, strengthen exports via networking with international suppliers and consolidating intra-regional partnerships to enable manufacturing through collaboration.

A must-attend event, this sourcing and trading expo enables the Sri Lankan RMG industry to source a vast array of natural and manmade textiles, trims, accessories, dyes, chemicals and software solutions by connecting with over 200 suppliers from over 15 countries with country pavilions from India, Taiwan, Pakistan, China as well as textile showcases by Korea and Japan.

This year also marks the debut of InMac, a boutique garment machinery and technology showcase co-located with Intex Sri Lanka. From advanced technology in sewing and embroidery to digital fashion technology solutions, InMac will see participation by Sri Lankan and Indian companies along with representations of products and services from over 10 countries.

Endorsed by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) and Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) along with its member associations, both Intex and InMac will offer comprehensive sourcing solutions for every stage of apparel production.
