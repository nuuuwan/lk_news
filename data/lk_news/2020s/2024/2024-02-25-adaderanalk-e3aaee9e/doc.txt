State Minister urges COPF to summon CBSL over controversial salary hikes

State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe has suggested that officials of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) be summoned before the parliamentary Committee on Public Finance (COPF), for clarifications pertaining to the recent increase in salaries of CBSL staff.

Taking to ‘X’ (formerly Twitter), the State Minister said, “I suggest to the Committee on Public Finance, that it is appropriate to summon the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to the Committee and seek clarification on the recent controversy regarding salary increments”.

Recent media reports revealed that the Central Bank had increased the salaries of its employees by 70% and the move was heavily criticized by parliamentarians of both the ruling party and the opposition.
