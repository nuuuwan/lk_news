SAITM to be handed over to University of Moratuwa

ECONOMYNEXT – The South Asian Institute of Technology (SAITM) and the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) will be handed over to the University of Moratuwa Faculty of Medicine in August, the president’s media division said.

This is for the University to make pre-arrangements before commencing academic studies in January 2025.

Successive governments’ efforts to open private medical faculties have ended with strong protests from leftists and Marxists.

SAITM and before it the North Colombo University in Ragama were forced to close after such protests.

Later, the North Colombo University was incorporated as the medical faculty of state-run University of Kelaniya. (Colombo/May31/2024)
