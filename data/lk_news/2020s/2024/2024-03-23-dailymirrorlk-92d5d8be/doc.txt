Two students hospitalised after ceiling fan collapses on them

Two fifth-grade students of an international school in Asgiriya, Kandy were hospitalised yesterday after a ceiling fan collapsed on them.

The injured students were admitted to the General Hospital, Kandy.

Hospital sources said that the eye of one student and the head of the other student were injured following the incident.

The incident occurred during school yesterday. The parents claimed that the ceiling fan was tangled with its electricity wires and swung during the past few days.

Even though the school administration was informed about the risk to children, no one had taken action to repair the fan.

The parents also claimed that the monthly fee of the school had also been increased to Rs. 5,000, and even the photocopy charges had been increased.
