Israel and Sri Lanka sign direct flights deal

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has signed a direct air service agreement with Israel, its Ports, Shipping, and Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva has said.

The agreement’s focus was on preventing delays in Sri Lankan workers’ migration abroad, de Silva said at a press briefing on Thursday (15).

“The agreement, signed between the Israeli Ministry of Transport and our Ministry of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation, marks the beginning of direct flights between Israel and Sri Lanka, aiming to enhance passenger convenience,” de Silva said.

He added that the agreement’s objective was facilitating prompt overseas employment for Sri Lankan workers and noted the interest of many Israelis in visiting Sri Lanka.

Last year Sri Lanka signed a deal to send 10,000 workers to Israel amid an ongoing war.

Sending Sri Lankans to work in Israel is insensitive: Legislator

Critics have pointed out that the timing of sending workers to Israel was not right. “Sending our workers to a country that is committing war crimes is like sending workers to nazi Germany, when Hitler was killing jews, and there were labour shortages,” MP Rauff Hakeem told parliament last November.
