Sri Lankan fishermen released from Myanmar prison on Burmese new year

ECONOMYNEXT – A total of 15 Sri Lankan fishermen arrested in Myanmar and sentenced to 7 years of rigorous imprisonment were released today, Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry has said.

“The 15 Sri Lankan fishermen taken into custody last December by Myanmar authorities sentenced to 07 years rigorous imprisonment, granted a general amnesty,” the Minister said on X (twitter).

Today marks the first day of the traditional Burmese new year’s day, during which the junta government released more than 3,000 prisoners, according to CGTN, a Chinese state-run English news channel.

It reports that among the released, 3,303 were Myanmar nationals, 36 “foreigners”, 13 Indonesians and 15 Sri Lankans.

Sri Lanka had previously petitioned the Myanmar government for clemency on behalf of the detained Sri Lankan fishermen.

Last week, 8 Sri Lankan cyber slaves who were imprisoned in Myanmar were received in Thailand, upon pardon by the junta government. The 8 people were found in Myawaddy, where they were held captive and forced into committing cybercrimes. (Colombo/April17/2024)
