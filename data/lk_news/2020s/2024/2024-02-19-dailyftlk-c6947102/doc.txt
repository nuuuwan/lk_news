Lumala revolutionises waste management practices with innovative Eco Hauler e-bike carts

City Cycle Industries Manufacturing Ltd., better known as Lumala, has introduced an innovative e-bike cart branded “Eco Hauler.”

This advanced e-bike cart is designed to tackle the urgent waste management issues in Sri Lanka, where daily plastic waste generation reaches approximately 938 metric tons, with only 4% being recycled.

In collaboration with the USAID Clean Cities, Blue Ocean (CCBO) program, the Eco Hauler initiative aims to combat ocean plastic pollution, address climate change, and boost waste collection efficiency in both urban and coastal areas, alongside riverbanks.

Characterised by its affordability, low operating costs, high load capacity, and eco-friendly design, the Eco Hauler reflects Lumala’s holistic approach to sustainability, and are actively seeking collaborations with municipalities, community organisations, and various stakeholders to enhance waste management practices throughout Sri Lanka and magnify the impact of the Eco Hauler.

Lumala CEO Tariq Miflal said: “Lumala is more than just about innovating products; it’s about envisioning and actualising a sustainable future for Sri Lanka. The Eco Hauler embodies our commitment to environmental sustainability, paving the way for a cleaner, greener planet. This philosophy underscores Lumala’s role as a leader in providing smart mobility solutions and fostering environmental sustainability.”

Lumala said it has consistently led the eco-friendly innovation charge in Sri Lanka’s bicycle industry. Lumala’s dedication to sustainability is evident across its wide range of products, which includes everything from robust mountain bikes for adventure seekers to efficient city cycles for daily commuters.

Lumala said the company is driven by a mission to enhance environmental health and to inspire an active lifestyle throughout the Sri Lankan community. Continuing in its path of innovation, Lumala is devoted to developing eco-friendly solutions that support the broader agenda of global sustainability. This dedication firmly establishes Lumala’s leadership in the realm of smart mobility and underscores our commitment to environmental stewardship.
