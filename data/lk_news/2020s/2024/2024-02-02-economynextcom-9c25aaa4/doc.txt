Sri Lanka port faces union opposition in increasing female workers: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Port authorities are facing opposition from tradition trade unions in increasing female workers, Shipping and Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.

The International Labour Organization had suggested that Sri Lanka improve gender equity in the port.

“I am a great fan of gender equity,” Minister de Silva told a forum where a capacity building project The Colombo Plan organization with US funding commenced.

“So, I suggested ‘Why don’t you train some lady gantry operators?”

Operating gantries it the key to operational efficiency of a container port and it is a premium salary job.

Minister de Silva said the ILO gave funds and Seafarers Association came forward to help.

About 50 females were selected from around the country and trained. After theory classes were completed at the Mahapola training centre, practical training was the next step.

The students were given letters of appointment as trainees for six months at the port.

“The unions went on trade union action at the port,” Minister de Silva said. “They said, ‘You can’t do that’, you have to give permanency to all other people before getting new trainees to the port.”

There were serious challenges to making any changes, he said.

The Port faced similar opposition when the first private terminals were built he said. (Colombo/Feb03/2024)
