Fire at South Korea lithium battery plant kills at least 16 people

A fire broke out at a lithium battery factory in South Korea on Monday, killing at least 16 people and leaving five others missing, local fire officials said.

The fire, which has largely been extinguished, occurred around 10:30 a.m. (9:30 p.m. Sunday ET) at a factory run by battery manufacturer Aricell in Hwaseong, south of the capital, Seoul.

The blaze began after a series of battery cells exploded inside a warehouse with some 35,000 units, said Kim Jin-young, a local fire official. What triggered the explosion remains unclear, he added.

The Yonhap news agency had earlier reported that some 20 bodies had been found inside the plant, but Kim told a televised briefing that 16 people died and two others had suffered serious injuries.

He said rescuers were trying to find the five people unaccounted for.

A Reuters witness saw firefighters moving as many as six bodies out of the factory, which is in an industrial area.

Established in 2020, Aricell makes lithium primary batteries for sensors and radio communication devices. It has 48 employees, according to its latest regulatory filing and its LinkedIn profile.

The company is not listed on South Koreaâ€™s stock market but is majority owned by S-Connect, according to an Aricell regulatory filing. S-Connect is registered on the junior Kosdaq index and its shares closed down 22.5%.

Live TV footage showed firefighters spraying the damaged steel and concrete building. Parts of the upper level had collapsed, and large chunks of the building looked as if they had been blown out into the street by an explosion.
