National Chamber of Exporters congratulates NPP on Parliamentary Election victory

The National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) yesterday extended its warm congratulations to the National People’s Power (NPP) on its recent success in the Parliamentary Elections.

“This historic election, characterised by a peaceful and democratic process, stands as a testament to the strength of Sri Lanka’s democratic principles and the commitment of its people to shape the future of the nation through their right to vote,” NCE said in a statement.

The NPP, aligned with the recently elected President, has risen to the Government with a clear mandate to address pressing economic issues and institute vital reforms. The people have voiced their choice for a Government focused on stabilising and revitalising the economy through robust policies designed to stimulate growth. A primary pledge of the NPP is to curb corruption and eliminate unnecessary expenditure, ensuring that national resources are directed toward productive and impactful initiatives. The new administration has also committed to removing bureaucratic barriers, paving the way for more seamless processes for foreign direct investment (FDI). By easing restrictions and cutting through red tape, the NPP aims to foster a welcoming environment for global investors, which in turn will help stimulate the economy, create jobs, and bring long-term benefits to the nation.

NCE President Jayantha Karunaratne said: “Sri Lankan exporters have much to gain under the NPP’s agenda, which places an emphasis on strengthening the export sector as a cornerstone of national economic growth. The NCE is particularly encouraged by the NPP’s approach to appointing competent authorities across essential sectors, a measure aimed at improving operational efficiency and facilitating trade. By prioritising exports, the NPP signals a clear understanding of the sector’s critical role in boosting foreign exchange earnings and elevating Sri Lanka’s global standing. We are optimistic that these policies will address key needs in the export sector, enabling businesses to overcome challenges, reach wider markets, and enhance their competitiveness on a global scale.”

NCE Secretary General and CEO Shiham Marikar further emphasised the resilience of Chamber members in their pursuit of export excellence. “Our members have been unwavering in their commitment to bringing in much-needed foreign currency. They continue to focus on increasing exports, investing in research and development, adding value to their products, and venturing into new markets. For years, the export community has urged the Government to eliminate red tape, eradicate corruption, and streamline the export process. We are encouraged by the NPP’s pledges and look forward to these critical reforms being implemented to create a more supportive environment for exporters.”

The NCE remains steadfast in its commitment to working closely with the Government to strengthen Sri Lanka’s export sector and contribute to the nation’s economic growth. The Chamber is ready to provide its expertise and collaboration in shaping policies that will empower exporters and drive sustainable development.
