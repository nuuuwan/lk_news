Expresses gratitude to Japan for important supportive role played in external debt restructuring process as a co-chair of Official Creditor Committee

Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabry this week in Japan underscored the country’s commitment to enhancing women’s participation across all societal sectors.

He made these remarks during his official visit to Japan from 1 to 7 July, when he asserted the importance of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) framework, highlighting its role in achieving sustainable international peace, security, and development.

“I look forward to sharing perspectives with Minister Kamikawa on various mutual interests, particularly on disarmament, non-proliferation, ongoing conflicts, and rising tensions,” Sabry stated during a press briefing. He praised Japan’s support in developing Sri Lanka’s National Action Plan (NAP) on Women, Peace, and Security, launched in March 2023.

Minister Sabry’s visit included meetings with key Japanese officials, including Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hayashi Yoshimasa. He expressed gratitude for Japan’s solidarity and significant assistance during Sri Lanka’s recent economic challenges, particularly their role as co-chair of the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) in the country’s debt restructuring process.

“Our countries have a warm and dynamic relationship, characterised by mutual respect and shared values of democracy, human rights, and open economic orientation,” Sabry remarked. He also highlighted the potential for further Japanese investments in various sectors such as power, infrastructure, and the green and digital economy.

Additionally, Sabry discussed Sri Lanka’s progress in national reconciliation and unity, including the operationalisation of the Interim Secretariat on the Truth and Reconciliation Mechanism. Japan’s support and understanding of Sri Lanka’s efforts in these areas were acknowledged with gratitude.

As the current Chair of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), Sabry shared Sri Lanka’s vision for promoting peace, stability, and sustainable development in the Indian Ocean region. He emphasised the importance of freedom of navigation and airspace to ensure the smooth functioning of international commerce and shipping.

Minister Sabry reaffirmed Sri Lanka’s commitment to deepening cooperation with Japan, appreciating the high-level political visits that invigorate this long-standing relationship. He invited Japan to resume investment projects in the pipeline and welcomed fresh investments to bolster Sri Lanka’s economic revival.

His visit underscores the robust and evolving relationship between Japan and Sri Lanka, built on decades of friendship and cooperation.
