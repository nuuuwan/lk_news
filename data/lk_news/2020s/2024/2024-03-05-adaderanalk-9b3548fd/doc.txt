Basil returns to Sri Lanka

Former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa returned to the island from the United States this morning (March 05).

A group of members of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) including Minister Prasanna Ranatunga, SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam, MP Sarath Weerasekara, were at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake to accord a warm welcome to the partyâ€™s founder.

Speaking to the media following his arrival, the former minister said the SLPP has never attempted to mislead the general public.

While asserting that he has no plans to return to the parliament, Rajapaksa said he would continue to guide the SLPP with election preparations.

Changes need to be made where it is needed, he commented further responding to a question raised by a media person
