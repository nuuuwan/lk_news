SJB to spend over Rs 20 Mn for protest on Jan. 30: Range Bandara

Colombo, Jan 23 (Daily Mirror) - Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) is to spend more than Rs 20 million to be paid for the people who are to be brought to Colombo for its protest on January 30 2023, UNP General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara alleged today.

Mr. Range Bandara told journalists that some of the funds have been allocated to provide liquor for those who are participating in the protest.

“A close associate of the SJB Leader has assured that he will pay for the protest. This person is alleged to have paid former MP Chaminda Wijesiri to resign from his parliamentary seat recently,” he added.

SJB General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara who commented on the matter denied allegations. “We have not thought of providing liquor and rewarding those who participate in our protest. It is the UNP which uses such tactics to bring people for their events,” he said.
