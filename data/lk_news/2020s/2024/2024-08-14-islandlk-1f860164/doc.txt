Apparel industry should grow without being ‘an enemy of the environment’

Sri Lanka apparel industry should develop more eco-friendly processes as there is a dire need for clothing makers to transition into a nature-friendly future, said Dr. Anil Jasinghe, Senior Additional Secretary, Presidential Secretariat and CEO, Climate Change Office Sri Lanka and all other subject matter experts who spoke at the first-ever Textile Sustainability Summit hosted by Teejay Group, at the Waters Edge Battaramulla on Aug 13, 2024.

They pointed out that it was high time the apparel manufacturers in Sri Lanka answered the clarion call for Triple Bottom Line of Business: People, Planet and Profit.

They discussed the future of fashion technology and ESG integration in the textile industry and how to collaborate among responsible apparel companies that keep ecology as a central part of their business nexus while supporting small and medium scale players in the industry to join this nature-action agenda.

The experts focused on the Digital Product Passport (DPP) within the textile industry, framed within the EU’s strategy for sustainable and circular textiles.

They examined the potential, needs, benefits, and challenges associated with deploying the DPP for all stakeholders throughout the European textile sector’s value chain as this would be crucial for Sri Lankan apparel manufacturers.

Further, they discussed the need for transparency of sourcing materials, colours, dyes, use of water, discharge of effluents and how product traceability information could be made available to the end consumer through QR code.

Pubudu De Silva, Chief Executive Officer, Teejay Group spoke about a series of actions to guide the local apparel industry towards ecological transition, with the goal of making Sri Lankan apparel products highly recognized and embraced by the sophisticated consumers in the global market.

“When the environmental conscious discerning consumers buy our products more and more, all others will follow suit,” he said.
