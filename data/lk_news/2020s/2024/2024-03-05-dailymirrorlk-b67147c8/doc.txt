Cabinet extends validity of scheme for Sri Lankans abroad to import electric vehicles

Colombo, March 5 (Daily Mirror) - The Cabinet has approved an extension of the validity period for the scheme enabling Sri Lankans working abroad to import fully electric vehicles, Cabinet spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardana said.

He said Cabinet approval was granted in August 2022 for the rollout of a scheme allowing Sri Lankans employed overseas to import fully electric vehicles.

This scheme operates on the condition of formal bank transfers of foreign remittances through licenced banks in Sri Lanka.

At the Cabinet meeting held in January 2024, it was further decided to extend the validity period of the scheme till June 30, 2024.

In line with this, the Cabinet has given approval to the proposal by the President, acting in his role as the Minister of Finance, to present the Import and Export Control Regulations No. 2 of 2024, issued under the Import and Export Control Act No. 1 of 1969, to parliament for approval.
