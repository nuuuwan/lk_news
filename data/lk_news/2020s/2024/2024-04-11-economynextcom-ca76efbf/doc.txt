Sri Lanka govt waits for LD approval to establish Chartered Institute for Journalists: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka government is waiting for the approval from the Legal Draftsman Department to proceed with  Chartered Institute for Journalists, State Media Minister Shantha Bandara said.

The Cabinet has approved the establishment of Chartered Institute for Journalists in 2021, but it has not taken off the ground amid Covid pandemic and an unprecedented economic crisis.

Media Minister Bandula Gunawardena had promised to complete the state-controlled professional media body by last year.

“We have sent it to the Attorney Legal Draftsman Department. The approval is yet to be given,” State Minister Bandara told reporters on Tuesday.

“We hope we get the approval, we will start the Chartered Institute of Journalism as soon as possible.”

Sri Lanka’s move to set up such institute aiming to strengthen the professionalism of journalists comes amid criticism over vast deterioration in terms of moral and cultural values in the country and journalists’ failure to prevent such deterioration.

The state-sponsored Chartered Institute for Journalists is expected to identify the problems in the field of journalism and to promote and maintain high standards in the field of media education in accordance with local and international academic standards has been identified, government has said in the past.
