Smart technologies and innovative solutions seen as vital to SL’s stepped-up solar power capability

Sri Lanka has achieved much in the solar energy industry sphere. However, the challenges lie ahead, said Prof. Asanka Rodrigo, electrical engineering expert from the University of Moratuwa. ‘As the country moves towards a future powered by renewable energy, smart technologies and innovative solutions will be key to ensuring that solar power plays a central role in its energy transition, he explained.

‘With a commitment to sustainability and collaboration between academia, industry, and government, Sri Lanka is well on its way to a brighter, greener future, Rodrigo said.

Speaking at the merger which took place at the Hilton Residences in Colombo, last week, between EPPC and SunGro, two leading brands in the solar industry, Rodrigo, a long-time academic and industry expert, stressed Sri Lanka’s growing commitment to renewable energy, particularly solar power and outlined the country’s ambitious targets for the future.

Rodrigo added: ‘Sri Lanka has committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, with a firm goal of sourcing 70% of its energy from renewable resources by 2030. Solar energy is a central part of this transition. There has been significant growth in solar power generation over the past decade.

‘Sri Lanka’s commercial solar power generation began modestly with off-grid systems in the 1980s. The introduction of the “mid-metering” scheme in 2009 marked the beginning of a rapid expansion in the industry. By 2016, Sri Lanka had only achieved 30 MW of solar capacity, but government initiatives, such as the “Surya Bala Sangramaya,” accelerated this growth. Targets of 200 MW by 2020 and 1,000 MW by 2025 were set and Sri Lanka has already surpassed these milestones, achieving 1 GW of solar capacity by July 2024.

‘The next phase of growth would be far more ambitious. By 2030, Sri Lanka aims to have 4,700 MW of solar power, more than four times its current capacity. This would require an annual increase of 500–600 MW, which, while challenging, is achievable if the industry continues to grow at its current pace.

‘To meet this target, the solar sector will need to diversify and expand in three main areas:

‘Solar rooftops: A growing segment in the residential and commercial sectors.

‘Ground-mounted projects: Large-scale installations producing 50 MW, 100 MW, or more, with some projects even aiming for 700 MW.

‘Floating solar projects: An emerging field, with pilot projects already underway in Hambantota, utilizing underused lakes and reservoirs.

‘Standards such as BS 7671 and IEC have adapted to these changes. The new generation of solar installations must consider complexities like multidirectional power flow, battery storage, electric vehicle (EV) chargers and advanced communication systems. Additionally, hybrid systems combining solar power with battery banks and grid connectivity are becoming more common and inverters are being classified as grid-forming or grid-following, reflecting their increasing complexity.

‘As solar energy systems become more integrated with the grid, new protection mechanisms are required to ensure safety and efficiency. For instance, anti-islanding protections, low voltage ride-through (LVRT) and other fault response technologies are essential to maintain grid stability.

‘Proper planning and technical expertise is essential in meeting Sri Lanka’s ambitious solar targets. While the challenges are significant, advancements in technology, coupled with government support and industry collaboration, can help the country achieve its renewable energy goals and create a more sustainable future.’

The event also saw the participation of key figures from Sri Lanka’s energy industry, including, Ranjith Sepala, chairman, Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) and Nalinda Ilangakoon, chairman, Ceylon Electricity Board. Additionally, SLSEA-registered solar PV service providers were present, to mark this significant milestone for the industry.
