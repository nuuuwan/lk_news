Imran Khan, wife sentenced to 14 years in state gifts case

Jan 31 - Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi have been sentenced to 14 years in jail in a case related to illegal selling of state gifts.

An accountability court – which deals with corruption cases – in Rawalpindi on Wednesday also ruled that the couple would be ineligible to contest for a public office for 10 years while also slapping a fine of 757 million rupees ($2.7m).

The sentencing came a day after Khan was given a 10-year prison term for revealing state secrets. It was not immediately clear if the sentences were to run consecutively or concurrently.

Khan was handed a three-year prison sentence in August for selling gifts worth more than 140 million rupees ($501,000) he received when he was the prime minister from 2018 to April 2022.

Though he secured bail, he remained in jail facing trial in other cases.

The convictions against arguably Pakistan’s most popular politician came a week before the general elections to be held on February 8.

Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has already been stripped of its election symbol, with most of its candidates contesting as independents.
