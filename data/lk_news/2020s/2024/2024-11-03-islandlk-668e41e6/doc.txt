New Anthoney’s Group achieves ISO 22000:2018 Certification for feed business

New Anthoney’s Group last week announced that its feeds division has been awarded the prestigious ISO 22000:2018 certification. This recognition underscores the company’s commitment to providing high-quality, safe, and sustainable feed solutions to meet the growing demands of Sri Lanka’s poultry industry.

A press release said: The certification marks a significant milestone for New Anthoney’s Feeds, ensuring that its products enhance poultry nutrition while promoting eco-friendly farming practices. This achievement follows the group’s strategic acquisition in 2022 of Gold Coin Feed Mills (Lanka) Ltd., a well-respected feed producer, further integrating its vertically aligned poultry operations.

Neil Suraweera, CEO of New Anthoney’s Group, remarked, “The ISO 22000:2018 certification reflects our dedication to maintaining the highest standards of quality and safety in both our feed and poultry products.” With a focus on innovation and sustainability, the group is committed to antibiotic-free poultry production, supported by eco-conscious feed.

As the first poultry producer in Sri Lanka to obtain FSSC 22000 certification, New Anthoney’s Group sets a benchmark for excellence in the region’s feed and poultry production sectors.
