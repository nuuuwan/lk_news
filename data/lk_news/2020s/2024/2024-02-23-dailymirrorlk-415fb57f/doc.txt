Sajith Premadasa seeks to retain private lawyer instead of Attorney General

Colombo, Feb 23 (Daily Mirror) - Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, as a member of the Constitutional Council (CC), has sought to retain a private lawyer instead of the Attorney General in the case in which the CC’s rejection of the nomination of Appeal Court President Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne as a judge of the Supreme Court has been challenged.

The CC which met last Monday discussed the matter. Mr. Premadasa sought to retain a private lawyer to intervene in the case.

The CC will meet again next Monday to take a final decision in this regard.

Mr. Premadasa has taken such a decision against the backdrop of the Attorney General informing the Supreme Court that the CC’s rejection of the appointment was not based on a collective decision.

A Fundamental Rights petition filed challenging the CC’s decision to reject Justice Karunaratne’s name has now been taken up for hearing .
