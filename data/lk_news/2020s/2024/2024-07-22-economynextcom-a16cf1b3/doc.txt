Sri Lanka cultivates hybrid durian for export

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka plans to cultivate 20,000 durian plants of two hybrid varieties for export purposes, the country’s Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera said.

“Arrangements have been made to cultivate two varieties of hybrid durians, Ambathanna and Kasun, which produce high yields in a short period of time,” Amaraweera said on Meta (Facebook).

“Both of these durian varieties do not grow as large as other dominant durian trees and grow to heights of 8 to 12 feet, but are two of the most productive varieties. Because of this, it is possible to cultivate even in an ordinary land,” Amaraweera said.

According to Sri Lanka’s Export Development Board, fruits produced in Sri Lanka are mainly exported to the UAE, India and Maldives.

Said to have been introduced to the island by the Portuguese initially, several new types were introduced later. The fruit with a unique odour is now being grown commercially on small scale in various regions. (Colombo/Jul22/2024)
