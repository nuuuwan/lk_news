Simply the best…

The BNS show, in London, last month (February) with Umaria Sinhawansa and Randhir Witana, backed by the group LunuDehi, was a sensational happening…for the huge crowd, as well as for the performers, on stage.

LunuDehi’s Dushan Jayathilake described the show as an unforgettable night. “The memories created were simply the best”, he went on to say.

“We had a nostalgic stroll across Abbey Road, recreating that iconic Beatles’ album cover moment, and also capturing timeless moments in front of Big Ben – London’s iconic landmark.

Dushan added that memories of the London vibe still linger in their minds, as they headed for Canada, along with BNS, Umaria and Randhir for four sold out concerts – 8th March Calgary, 9th March Vancouver, 15th March Ottawa, and 16th March Toronto.

They are also scheduled to do a concert at the Montalbán Theatre, in Hollywood, on April 6, 2024.
