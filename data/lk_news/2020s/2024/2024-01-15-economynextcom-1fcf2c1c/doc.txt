Sri Lanka revises import duties for 1,222 items under Singapore FTA

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has published import duties of up to 20 percent applied to 1,222 items under a free trade agreement with Singapore.

Sri Lanka usually has a negative list for imports in trade deals.

In addition, so-called para tariffs, such as the Sri Lanka’s Airport Levy as well as an import CESS is also charged from some goods.

Excessively high import duties on some items, imposed to give artificially high profits to politically connected producers while harming consuemrs, have led to undervaluation and corruption, critics say.
