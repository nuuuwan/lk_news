In town for festive activities

Sri Lanka-born Roger Menezes, from the land Down Under, is in town to entertain during the festive season.

Now residing in Sydney, Roger is a frequent visitor to his land of birth and is generally seen in action at the Galadari Hotel, in Colombo.

His music is much appreciated by a wide audience, especially those who love the songs of the Golden era, and that is precisely why he had to head for Kandy, no sooner he arrived in Sri Lanka, to perform at the Mahaweli Reach Hotel, on December 15th.

Roger says he has plans to stay here and take in Valentine’s Day as well, February 14th, before going back to Australia.

However, there is a possibility of Roger heading for Australia, sometime in January, 2025, to perform at a 60th wedding anniversary ceremony.

“They asked me if I could do the needful, with air ticket provided, and I said ‘It can be done.’ And I’ll be back in Colombo, probably a week later,” said Roger.

Although Roger has been residing in Australia for decades, he still considers Sri Lanka is home.

“Who knows, one day I may pack my bags and return to my land of birth…permanently,” he quipped.
