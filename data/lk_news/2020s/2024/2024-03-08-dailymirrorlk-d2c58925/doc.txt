Sri Lanka face Bangladesh in T20I series decider

Mar. 9 (AFP) - Sri Lanka takes on Bangladesh in the third and last game of the three-match Twenty20 International (T20I) series at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium in Sylhet tomorrow.

The series is locked at 1-1 at this moment. Sri Lanka edged Bangladesh past by three wickets following a thrilling contest in the first match while the hosts took sweet revenge in the second game, thrashing the visitors by eights in comprehensive fashion.

Overall Bangladesh won five and lost 10 in the 15 matches between the two sides in this format.

A series victory for either side will be a huge booster ahead of the ICC T20I World Cup to be held in the United States of America (USA) and the West Indies.

After losing the first match, Bangladesh played a near perfect game in the second game with Captain Najmul Hossain Shanto leading from the front.

Shanto hammered a 38 ball-53 not out to sail the side home and in doing so, he hit back to form, which was a concern for Bangladesh after a horribly poor Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) outing.

The Bangladesh bowlers also bowled well to restrict Sri Lanka in a moderate total.
