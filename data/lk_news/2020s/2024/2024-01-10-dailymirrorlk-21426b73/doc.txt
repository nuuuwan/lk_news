Stifling factors that frustrate females  in Sri Lankan politics

Sri Lanka has its very own illustrious history in politics where the country recorded the swearing in of its first female prime minister; which also marked the first such instance in the world. That was none other than Sirimavo Bandaranaike and she was sworn in as Prime Minister on July 21, 1960.

“Sri Lankan women are not in decision making positions,” stressed Former MP and one time minister of housing and common amenities Ferial Ashraff. Speaking to the Daily Mirror she said that she doubted whether this situation has been caused due to the attitude of the society. She also raised her concerns saying that the number of opportunities given to women at decision making level is extremely low. Also she mentioned with disappointment that one can rarely a find a woman holding extremely higher portfolios. On the other hand she doubted how men can take decisions on behalf of women. Ferial is the wife of late former MP M.H.M. Ashraff. She said that she got to know people because of her husband. She stressed a common norm in this society by underscoring that she wouldn’t have had an opportunity to be known in society if she wasn’t connected to a family with a political background where a male was involved in politics.

“We only have widows, sisters of dead men, daughters of dead men who come into politics. True enough, because that is the only way we get introduced to the public, that’s why the majority of women who enter politics have to have a male involved in politics,” added Ferial.

She appreciates the 25% quota set aside for women representation in politics; an idea which was introduced by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in Local Government Elections. She said that she would appreciate if there is a quota for women in parliamentary elections as well. She sees something positive in this quota because there is at least one opportunity for women to come forward in politics. Moreover she sees a problem with the women in the society too. She said that women are also casting their votes for a male representative during the elections.

“If you are a woman and contesting at an election where there is a male candidate all the women would vote for the man. This is because they don’t have the confidence that female politician will be able to deliver. Because females are used to the concept where men are engaged in politics. 52% of the population in Sri Lanka comprises women. So, who has to change; man or woman? The woman has to change. Women should understand that they should actively participate at the decision-making level,” explained Ferial. She stressed, “This country wouldn’t be this bankrupt if we had women out there,” said Ferial. She added that if there are not enough women representations in parliament the relevant decision makers at the parliament must have at least a woman consultative body.

“I am saying women have to be consulted. Involve the women in decision and policy making. Appoint consultative bodies comprising women. Appoint women consultants regarding policy issues. When the parliament makes decisions consider the ideas of women too. When we speak about women’s issues people think that we are trying to convey that women are the best. Here we are speaking about gender balance. There should be a balance in women and men representation,” added Ferial. In order to change this attitude Ferial said that the Sri Lankan education system should be changed. The education system must convey the message to children about the importance of women and they should be taught about the gender balance and not that a mother is there to cook at home and the father is there to go to work and earn.

“There are things that we learn which are totally not right. Therefore I suggest that both women and men learn-unlearn and relearn. We can’t progress by having gender bias. Men and women have to work together. The country has to work together. We can’t be divided and progress. We must get onto the right track. Otherwise, we won’t progress,” explained Ferial.

“We have much child abuse and domestic violence and we don’t see women coming up with suggestions,” Former Colombo Municipal Councilor Sharmila Gonawala told Daily Mirror.

She affirmed that there are not enough female representatives in parliament and though there are a few female representatives in the parliament they are not making strong suggestions.

“They don’t make a joint effort. They don’t make a constant effort and at least if the men are not doing anything the women parliamentarians should get together and suggest that this country has to be developed based on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 17 which is internationally accepted. I think knowledge is number one and then you have to update and upgrade your knowledge everything else,” said Gonawala.

“There are right women, capable women and right candidates who want to come up, they have not been given that opportunity because there is always a widow, a daughter or a sister coming from a political family. Even the British have said that we Sri Lankans were not ready to embrace democracy because we would have always voted the wrong people in,” she said. Gonawala said she was disappointed about how candidates have been elected from the political parties.

What Gonawala suggests is that there should be at least 15% women representation in the Parliament. She added that women candidates who have a “heart and common sense” and who are “capable” of taking the country forward must enter parliament.

“Until there is a national policy regarding the number of women in the nomination list it would be very difficult. To win you have to be in the nomination list of the winning party. I think that is the biggest hurdle that a woman encounters,” added Gonawala.

Bisliya Bhutto, is a former member of Puttalam Pradesiya Sabha, who encountered so many religious and cultural barriers at the time she wished to enter politics. When she was elected to the Pradesiya Sabha she recalled how there were cyber attacks on her and the making of fake social media accounts in her name which were used against her. Also her photos had been circulated on social media and fake details about her were spread. While recalling such memories Bisliya said, “When women try to enter politics without the support of a male who is already involved in politics it is really hard for them to survive because females are subject to getting blackmailed”. Bisliya mentioned that there are religious and cultural barriers for women who wish to enter politics.

Former Head of Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Dr. Deepika Udagama when contacted said that it is very difficult to change the existing political system in Sri Lanka. She said, “You can’t have a system which is very hierarchical. I think the political situation in Sri Lanka is full of problems. When political parties are not very democratic they don’t have internal democracy. It is really futile to talk about larger representation for women and minorities. First we have to focus on the larger picture of the political system. The political system really needs new faces, new political parties with a modern vision of Sri Lanka,” explained Dr. Udagama. She appreciated the 25% quota for female representation that was introduced in local government elections. “But to fill that quota in the existing political system much is desired because the party system is hugely male oriented, very hierarchical, not democratic and males don’t want to share opportunities. First, we must focus on this, then on the political parties and then of course I think we need to have laws that ensure this quota for women. That is absolutely essential. Having quotas is very important. In some African countries women have really come forward in political representation and this may be due to the quota system. Create an environment where political parties are forced to support female candidates because of the quota system. 25% quota for women at the local government is inadequate, but still they introduced this system. There has to be better discussions in the public about the need for female representatives. You see in parliament how they run down female politicians. They attack them using foul language. That is the current situation. Political parties should respect female candidates. There have to be a major change in the mind set. You can’t promote the idea of women representation in this existing political culture. Because it is too hierarchical,” explained Dr. Udagama.

She stressed that with the current existing political system in Sri Lanka it is not efficient to have quotas for women representation. She said that this country needs “more new political parties with new young faces.”

Executive Director at Institute for Democratic Reforms and Electoral Studies (IRES) and the former national coordinator for Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV) Manjula Gajanayake said that in political representation there should be an equal ground. Gajanayake stated that women participation in Sri Lankan politics doesn’t meet the standard level. He appreciated the introduction of the 25% quota for women representation, but affirmed that it is not enough.

“Luckily there is a quota for women representation and it is 25%. Even that 25% has not been fulfilled considering all local councils, urban councils and provincial councils and municipal councils. They have fulfilled only 23.8 % only. Not 25%,” added Gajanayake.

He assumes that women do not want to take part in politics due to the discrimination against them. He points out that the political parties are also responsible for this because they don’t nominate females to the nomination list.

“The major problem in Sri Lanka is not the quantity of women representation. The problem is that mainstream parties representing our parliament are not giving an opportunity to women to contest in politics. That is a major issue. If there are enough women at the executive levels of political parties, it is easy to promote women political participation in Sri Lanka. Unfortunately it is not happening,” added Gajanayake.

He disagreed with the statement that women are not voting for women. Gajanayake mentioned that if the women election campaigns are creative they will garner more votes.

Gajanayake has a positive outlook towards the campaign finance law because he believes that this law can promote women representation in politics in this country. Gajanayke doesn’t believe that money will be a barrier for the women who contest at elections. “Unfortunately when we compare ourselves with the women in other countries, our females have taken a back seat. What did the government do to promote women participation in politics in Sri Lanka? Only the Yahapalana Government did something. They introduced the quota. Even the Ministry of Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment failed in this. Most political parties are not inviting women to come forward and raise their voices. One reason is jealousy. For decades in Sri Lanka men have been thinking that politics belong to them. Male politicians are feeling insecure; therefore, they are not giving opportunities to women to come forward. Honestly, I am thinking that as a head of election monitoring, I also think that we are not promoting women enough. We can select some women who are very capable,” explained Gajanayake.

Legal expert and former Human Rights Commissioner Dr. Prathiba Mahanamahewa told the Daily Mirror that some laws should be introduced in order to attract more women into Sri Lankan politics. “A law should be passed. Every political party must be given an opportunity to contest elections; especially at the municipal council, provincial council, Pradeshiya sabha as well as general elections. I recommend a quota between 15% - 25% for women from each political party. It is happening in India. So, when you take the Sri Lankan parliament and the 225 representatives, at least 25% of them should be women,” said Dr.Mahanamahewa.

Dr. Mahanamahewa said, “Women need energy and encouragement. This encouragement is not present in the Asian culture. So, women should be encouraged to enter politics from university level. Most of the time women are engaged in household work, looking after children and are busy with husband’s work. When women enter politics there are other harassments taking place. When you take universities 85% of the students comprise female candidates. Educated women graduates are there. But they are not given the opportunities,” in Sri Lanka.

“Basically, in the legislature they think that the women are not capable. Still in politics it is very hard to get women participation. There are so many barriers for these women. Also, there are family barriers and sometimes the husband may not be giving the consent. When you compare with some other countries women are not independent in Sri Lanka. Women are not empowered like in other countries. That is a cultural barrier. Women in other countries have changed the world. My argument is that to have a sound and balanced parliament at least 25% female representation must be there,” he said underscoring the dangers of the decline in women participation in politics.
