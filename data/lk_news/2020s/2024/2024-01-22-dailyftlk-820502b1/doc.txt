Sri Lanka Ramanna Sect has expelled Buddhist monk Ratnapura Wimalabuddhi Thera who identifies himself as ‘Sri Vishwa Buddha’ following his initial arrest by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) on 12 December.

The expulsion of the controversial novice monk has been reported to the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs by the Chief Prelate of the Sect, the most Venerable Makulewe Sri Wimala Thera.

Initially, the monk faced arrest for expressing views inconsistent with Buddhist teachings on social media and was granted bail on 8 January by the Colombo Chief Magistrate. Subsequently, he was arrested once again yesterday, this time for making statements that were derogatory towards Buddhism, and he has been remanded until 26 January after being produced before the Gangodawila Magistrate’s Court.

The decision to expel Ratnapura Wimalabuddhi Thera was unanimously reached during the Karaka Sangha meeting of the Ramanna Sect held on 15 December.

As per the unanimous decision reached by the Ramanna Sect, both the novice and higher ordination documents of Ratnapura Wimalabuddha Thero will be invalidated.

The announcement of the Sect also specifies that Ratnapura Wimalabuddhi Thera was expelled due to the considerable damage inflicted upon the Buddha Sasana by him.
