Mujeeb to miss T20I series against Sri Lanka, Rashid Khan still not fit

Feb. 12 (ICC) - Ibrahim Zadran will continue to lead the T20I team with Rashid Khan still recovering from the back surgery he underwent last year.

In another major blow for the visitors, Mujeeb ur Rahman also misses out, having sustained a sprain in his right hand before the ODI series.

Wafadar Momand has been recalled to the squad after his lone appearance in 2023 with Mohammad Saleem Safi continuing to recover from a hamstring strain that saw him miss the ODIs against Sri Lanka.

"We have consistently aimed to provide our young players with the exposure they deserve, a commitment we have maintained successfully so far," Naseeb Khan, the CEO of ACB, said.

"Building a strong bench strength is a priority for us, as we want to ensure we have good backups for our key players when needed, the role Qais Ahmad is currently playing for Rashid Khan.

The series begins on February 17 in Dambulla with the following games at the same venue on 19th and 21st.

Afghanistan T20I squad: Ibrahim Zadran (c), Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Mohammad Ishaq Rahimi (WK), Hazratullah Zazai,Â  Gulbadin Naib, Mohammad Nabi, Najibullah Zadran, Azmatullah Omarzai, Karim Janat, Sharafuddin Ashraf, Fazal Haq Farooqi, Fareed Ahmad, Naveen Ul Haq, Noor Ahmad, Wafadar Momand and Qais Ahmad.
