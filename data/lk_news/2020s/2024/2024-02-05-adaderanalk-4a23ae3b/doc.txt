Three arrested over shooting of Buddhist monk in Gampaha

Three suspects have been arrested in connection with the shooting of a Buddhist monk in the Gampaha area last month.

On 23 January, 45-year-old Ven. Kalapaluwawe Dhammarathana Thero was shot dead inside a temple in the Malwathuhiripitiya area of Gampaha.

Four unidentified individuals had arrived in a car, claiming to be officers from the Criminal Investigations Department (CID), and opened fire at the monk with a T-56 assault rifle.

The Buddhist monk had sustained critical injuries in the incident and was subsequently rushed to the Gampaha Hospital, where he later succumbed to his injuries.
