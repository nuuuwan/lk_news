Lecturer arrested for false remarks on ISIS arrests in India

Colombo, May 29 (Daily Mirror) - The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested a lecturer attached to the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) for making false statements to the media regarding the ISIS members arrested in India.

Police Spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa said Dr. Punsara Amarasinghe  was arrested yesterday after being summoned to the CID to record a statement over remarks he had made during a TV programme.

On May 20, four Sri Lankans were arrested by the Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad at Ahmedabad Airport on suspicion of having ISIS links. The lecturer recently claimed in media interviews that the report of the Commission on the Easter Sunday bomb attacks had recommended these men for rehabilitation.

However, when questioned by the CID, the lecturer admitted to being unaware of the relevant details, thus leading to his arrest.

The Police spokesman said the suspect will be produced before court today.

Meanwhile, the police arrested two more individuals in Bangadeniya, Chilaw for their alleged connections with tbe ISIS members who were arrested in India.
