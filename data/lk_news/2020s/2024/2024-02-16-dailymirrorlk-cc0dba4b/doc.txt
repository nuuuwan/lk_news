Quetta Gladiators await NOC for Hasaranga for PSL 9

Feb. 16 (cricketpakistan) - Quetta Gladiators issued an update regarding the status of their foreign players ahead of the ninth season of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) on Friday.

Gladiators' head of player acquisition, Nabeel Hashmi, confirmed through his social media account that originally slated for the first five matches, Hasaranga may miss more due to scheduling issues with the Afghanistan vs. Sri Lanka series. Despite efforts, Quetta is still awaiting his No Objection Certificate.

On the coaching front, mentor Sir Vivian Richards and bowling coach Shaun Tait have already arrived in Pakistan ahead of the tournament.

Similar to the previous edition, PSL 9 will be held in two legs. Lahore and Multan will host 14 matches from February 17 to 27, followed by 16 matches in Rawalpindi and Karachi from February 28 to March 12. The playoffs will then be held entirely in Karachi.
