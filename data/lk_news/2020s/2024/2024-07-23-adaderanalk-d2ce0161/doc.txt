SLFP internal crisis: Another court decision pending for tomorrow

The Colombo District Court ordered the decision on whether or not to suspend the declaring of the verdict of the plaint filed by MP Dayasiri Jayasekara until a decision is taken related to Lasantha Alagiyawanna’s request to intervene in the plaint, to be communicated tomorrow (24).

This order was issued when the relevant plaint was called before the court today (23).

Jayasekara had filed the relevant complaint before the Colombo District Court, challenging the decision taken by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to expel him as the party’s General Secretary and a letter directed by the party’s then chairman Maithripala Sirisena asking Jayasekara to provide excuses to defend himself against a disciplinary inquiry.
