No pressure from China, says Sri Lanka state finmin after official visit

ECONOMYNEXT – There was no pressure from China during an official visit by Sri Lankan delegation led by Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, State Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe said after concluding a six-day official visit to the World’s second largest economy.

Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena met Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Li Qiang in Beijing before participating in BOAO Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2024 in Hainan in China.

“The visit was good. There was no pressure,” Semasinghe told EconomyNext when asked if there were any specific pressure from China after Beijing’s strong protest over Sri Lanka allowing a German research vessel despite a one-year ban on all research ships was in place.

“No project was discussed. We just wanted to conclude the (debt) resolutions. We signed some MOUs, and discussed on the debt restructuring.”

The official visit to China is significant as Sri Lanka needs Beijing’s help to conclude bilateral and commercial debt restructuring.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said any debt restructuring mechanism with Chinese government and private firms should be in par with the other debt restructuring mechanisms.

During the visit, Sri Lanka held bilateral talks with paying  more attention to increasing overall cooperation in the social, cultural, educational, and agricultural sectors in addition to economic cooperation. (Colombo/April 1/2024)
