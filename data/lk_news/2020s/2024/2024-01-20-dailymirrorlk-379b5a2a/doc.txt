Acting IGP directs police not to stop vehicles while they are in civilian attire

Acting Inspector General of Police, Deshabandu Thennakoon has issued a fresh set of instructions to all police stations, directing them not to halt vehicles for inspections when officers are in civilian clothes while on duty.

These new guidelines were distributed to all police stations yesterday.

These guidelines were issued in response to a tragic incident that unfolded in Narammala on Thursday, involving a Sub Inspector of Police in civilian attire who reportedly opened fire at a lorry driver after the latter allegedly refused to stop his lorry.
