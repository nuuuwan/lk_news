UNFPA Director urges action to safeguard womenâ€™s rights in post-pandemic Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka, March 07 - Amidst the challenges of a post-pandemic world and economic uncertainties, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) underscores the critical importance of protecting the rights and dignity of women and girls in Sri Lanka.

During a recent three-day visit to the island nation, Pio Smith, the Asia-Pacific Regional Director of UNFPA, emphasized the urgent need for dedicated efforts towards the health, safety, and wellbeing of women and girls.

In his discussions with key Sri Lankan officials, international partners, and diplomatic representatives, Mr. Smith reiterated UNFPA's commitment to supporting Sri Lanka's recovery journey. Gender equality and empowerment were highlighted as integral pillars for progress in the nation's development trajectory.

UNFPA's initiatives in Sri Lanka range from the establishment of One-Stop Centers to the delivery of mobile health clinics, ensuring that women and girls, especially the most vulnerable and marginalized, have access to essential sexual and reproductive health services.

Reflecting on the 30th anniversary of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD30) and 50 years of UNFPA's presence in Sri Lanka, Mr. Smith emphasized the importance of elevating the status of women and championing the rights of girls. He stressed that such actions can catalyze the emergence of robust, resilient, and inclusive communities with sustainable impacts on current and future generations.

UNFPA's commitment in Sri Lanka extends beyond immediate relief efforts, focusing on long-term systemic change through strategic partnerships and youth-led initiatives. In 2022 alone, UNFPA mobilized over $7 million, reaching tens of thousands of individuals with vital assistance tailored to meet diverse community needs amidst the ongoing socio-economic crisis.

As Sri Lanka progresses on its recovery journey, UNFPA remains a steadfast ally, collaborating closely with the government, implementation partners, and global stakeholders to propel development initiatives forward. Mr. Smith concluded his visit with a hopeful message, aspiring for a future where every woman and girl in Sri Lanka has a role in shaping the nation's collective destiny.
