41-year-old man found hacked to death inside home

An individual has been hacked to death using a sharp weapon early this morning (15) in a house in Rathukurusawatta area of Moratuwa.

The deceased has been identified as 41-year-old Harendra Kumara, also known as ‘Podi Aiya’ while Moratuwa Police has arrested a suspect in connection with the incident.

The motive behind the murder has not been ascertained yet and Moratuwa Police are conducting further investigations into the incident.

The residents of the area claim that at around 11.00 p.m. last night, they had heard a loud noise from near the house in question of someone shouting and that they had refrained from looking into it due to hearing the sound of ‘Pirith’ chanting from the house shortly after.

However, it was later revealed that the deceased’s wife, who had been tied up using ropes, managed to alert a female neighbour via her mobile phone after breaking free.

Upon entering the house, the neighbour had discovered the scene while later the residents in the area have rushed the wife to a hospital.
