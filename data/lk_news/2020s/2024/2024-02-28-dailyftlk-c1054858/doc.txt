Japan extends Rs. 2.5 b grant to strengthen border-related health capacities

Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena says move to boost tourism industry further

Considering the significant contribution of the tourism industry to the economy, Japan has agreed to extend a grant of Yen 1.17 billion (around Rs. 2.5 billion) via the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to strengthen border-related health preparedness at two key entry ports in Sri Lanka.

The Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) and Colombo Port will see an upgrade in its health capacities according to international practices, recommendations and standards through the grant facility.

“The financial aid will help to improve health capacities to deal with direct contribution of the control of infectious disease and the overall security of all passengers, staff and staff of points of entry in various health emergencies,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

The initiative will help smooth the operation of entry points into the country, build confidence among visitors and arrange cross-border entry points to comply with international health regulations on movement.

Noting that the tourism industry remains a net foreign exchange earner to the economy, Gunawardena asserted the move will further boost the tourism industry.

The proposal submitted by the Ports, Shipping and Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers at its meeting on Monday.
