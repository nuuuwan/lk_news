Urgent meeting of SLFP politburo to be convened?

Senior Vice President of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva has requested the party’s Acting General Secretary to convene the SLFP’s politburo on April 08.

At the said politburo meeting, the party’s future endeavours, against the backdrop of the enjoining order imposed on SLFP chairman and former President Maithripala Sirisena, are expected to be taken up for discussion.

On Thursday (04), the Colombo District Court issued an enjoining order to be in effect until April 18, preventing Sirisena from functioning as the SLFP chairman, following a complaint filed by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.

However, Sirisena has reacted, saying that he intends to present facts before the court regarding the matter.
