Sri Lanka’s SJB wants mutually agreeable dates for debate with NPP

ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka’s main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya will formally write to rival National People’s Power (NPP) this week inviting a representative for a discussion on a mutually agreeable date for an election debate.

SJB legislator Nalin Bandara said the party will write to NPP’s Nalinda Jayatissa for a discussion on either Thursday April or Friday 26 on a time, date and venue for the proposed debate.

This is despite the NPP having already written to the SJB inviting the latter’s leader Sajith Premadasa for a debate with NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake on May 7, 9, 13 or 14.

“They have unilaterally declared a few dates in May for the two leaders. But there is no mention of the debate between the two economic councils. But no problem,” said Bandara.

Bandara said the discussion being sought with Jayatissa will be held at the parliament complex.

However, Premadasa has other commitments on the dates proposed by the NPP, he said.

“There’s a farmer’s convention and a women’s convention, among other events. We must arrange the dates together. They can’t do it unilaterally,” Bandara insisted.

SJB general secretary and MP Ranjith Madduma Bandara said the debate must be held in a public place.

“Yes, we got the letter. We’re discussing the date and where to have the debate. It has to be a public place. We also invite them to a debate with our economic council. Let’s do both at once. They’re trying to avoid the economic debate,” he claimed.

Both parties have been accusing the other of trying to avoid the calls for a debate in the run-up to the presidential election.

The leftist NPP, controlled by the Marxist-Leninist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), currently lead at least one opinion poll, significantly ahead of the SJB. (Colombo/Apr24/2024)
