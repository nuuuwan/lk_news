’Ibba’ hacked to death

A 32 year old man of the Fisheries Village in Lunugamvehera was hacked to death during the early hours of this morning.

Police said the victim Kelum Thushara alias “Ibba” had received serious cut injuries and one of his upper limbs had been severed from his body. They believe that a previous animosity between two parties would have resuled in the killing.

The Thissamaharama magistrate who visited the scene and held the preliminary magesterial inquiry ordered police to refer the body to  the JMO for a postmortem examination.

Lunugamvehera police are conducting further investigations on the instructions of SSP Tangalle Division K.B. Kirthiratna.
