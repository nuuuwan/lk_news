Accepting postal voting applications ends tonight

The deadline for the accepting of applications to cast postal votes ends today (05).

The Election Commission earlier announced that the duly filled applications must be handed over to District Returning Officers through the District Election Office address on or before August 05.

The election regulatory body announced that the application forms to be completed for availing the postal voting facility can be obtained free of charge from the places where the voters’ lists are displayed, from the district election offices and also from the website of the Election Commission.

The applications must be received by the respective District Election Offices before 12.00 midnight today, and mere delivery of applications by post on that day is not a reason for acceptance of applications, the Election Commission said.

The applications received after the deadline will be rejected without consideration, as per the Election Commission.

However, the commission announced that several information being circulated on social media stating that the deadline for accepting the applications to cast postal votes has been extended, are completely false and that the relevant deadline will not be extended under any circumstances.

The postal vote applicants and all other voters can obtain any further information by visiting the website www.elections.gov.lk.

Meanwhile, the 2024 voters’ list related to all the electoral districts will be displayed at the following locations during usual office hours from July 26, 2024.
