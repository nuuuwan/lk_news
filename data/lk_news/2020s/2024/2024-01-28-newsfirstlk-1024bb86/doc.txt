Three US soldiers killed, 25 injured in drone attack in Jordan

Colombo (News 1st) – In the first US military fatalities since the Gaza War began, three US troops have been killed and 25 injured in a drone attack on a US base in Jordan on Saturday night (27th), near the Syrian border, the US has announced.

US President Joe Biden issued a statement blaming Iran-backed military groups operating in Syria and Iraq.

“Today, America’s heart is heavy. Last night, three U.S. service members were killed—and many wounded—during an unmanned aerial drone attack on our forces stationed in northeast Jordan near the Syria border.  While we are still gathering the facts of this attack, we know it was carried out by radical Iran-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq”, Biden said in a statement.

He also warns of reprisals, adding: "And have no doubt – we will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner our choosing."

There are some 3,000 US soldiers stationed at various bases in Jordan, which borders Israel, Syria and Iraq.

This is the latest in a series of attacks on US bases in Iraq and Syria by Iranian backed groups in the region since the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza conflict in October.
