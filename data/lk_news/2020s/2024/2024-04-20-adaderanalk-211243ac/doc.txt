Sri Lanka to establish a High Commission in Wellington, NZ

An official delegation of the Foreign Affairs Ministry will visit New Zealand from 22-25 April to attend to the matters related to the opening of the Sri Lankan High Commission in Wellington.

The delegation will be led by the Director General of the Overseas Assets Management and Development Division of the Foreign Ministry, Pradeepa Saram.

During the visit, the delegation will engage in meetings with officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of New Zealand, and other related agencies and stakeholders.

In January this year, the Cabinet of Ministers approved a proposal presented by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry looking to establish a High Commission in Wellington.

New Zealand has a significant Sri Lankan expatriate community comprising mostly professionals and students. The opening of a resident Mission will facilitate outreach to the community and pursuit of stronger collaboration in the fields of trade, education, sports, science and technology, tourism and health.

New Zealand opened a resident Mission in Sri Lanka in 2021, which is an important milestone in the bilateral relations between the two countries.
