Plans afoot to obtain ’Blue Flag Beaches’ certification for Sri Lankan beaches

Colombo, April 19 (Daily Mirror)- Steps are being taken to obtain the official certification of 'Blue Flag Beaches' for Unawatuna, Bentota, Pasikuda and Arugam Bay, the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) said.

This was revealed during a recent meeting of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Environment, Natural Resources and Sustainable Development chaired by MP Ajith Mannapperuma.

It was revealed that twenty-eight beaches which have more tourist attraction have been selected for the 'Blue Flag Beaches' certification and that 33 criteria need to be fulfilled for this certification.

The Chairman pointed out that India, which started the initiative even after Sri Lanka, had already obtained 'Blue Flag Beaches' certification for eight beaches, whereas Sri Lanka is yet to commence the project which was initiated by him as the State Minister of Environment.

The Chairman stressed the need to expedite the project in coordination with the relevant institutions.

The iconic Blue Flag is one of the world’s most recognised voluntary awards for beaches, marinas and sustainable tourism boats.
