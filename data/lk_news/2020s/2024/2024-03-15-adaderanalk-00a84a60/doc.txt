SC delays verdict on petitions against recommendations of PCoI on political victimisation

The Supreme Court on Friday (15) concluded the hearing of petitions seeking the annulment of recommendations and findings of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) appointed by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to investigate alleged incidents of political victimisation.

Despite concluding the hearing, however, the Supreme Court deferred announcing its decision.

The petitions were filed by Presidentâ€™s Secretary Saman Ekanayake, former Navy Commander Travis Sinniah, former High Court Judge Padmini Ranawaka, and others.
