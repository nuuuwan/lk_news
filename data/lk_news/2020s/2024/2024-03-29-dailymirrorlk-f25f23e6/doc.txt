Colombo, MarchÂ  29 (Daily Mirror) - The train operations on the coastal line will run on a single track between Colombo Fort and Wellawatta railway stations until Sunday (31), the Railways Department said.

They said the decision was taken due to the development work to be carried out by the Colombo Municipal Council near the Bambalapitiya railway station.

Accordingly, arrangements have been made to cancel several train services on these days, and some trains will be delayed, the department said.
