Range Bandara invites key SJB MPs to rejoin party

Invites MPs  Harsha de Silva, Thalatha Atukorale, Eran Wickramaratne and Kabir Hashim to strengthen President’s efforts in rebuilding SL

Claims SJB leadership is marginalising these MPs after control has shifted to SLPP aligned group

United National Party (UNP) General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara issued an open invitation to several prominent Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MPs yesterday to rejoin the UNP ahead of the upcoming polls.

Addressing a press conference, Range Bandara accordingly invited SJB MPs Harsha de Silva, Thalatha Atukorale, Eran Wickramaratne and Kabir Hashim to rejoin the age-old party.

“We are aware of the way MPs skilled in economic affairs such as Harsha de Silva and Eran Wickramaratne, as well as Ratnapura district MP Thalatha Atukorale, who led women’s movements, have been treated,” the UNP General Secretary said.

He pointed out that control of the SJB has shifted to a group affiliated with the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), resulting in the marginalisation of these MPs. “SJB leader Sajith Premadasa no longer prioritises MPs like Harsha, Kabir, Thalatha, and Eran. Why should they remain in an environment where they are not valued?” he questioned. The UNP General Secretary said he was therefore extending a sincere invitation to Harsha de Silva, Thalatha Atukorale, Eran Wickramaratne, and Kabir Hashim to rejoin the UNP and work together with its leader, President Ranil Wickremesinghe.  “Join Ranil Wickremesinghe in strengthening efforts to rebuild the country,” he urged. He added that rejoining their former party is the most appropriate decision at this time.
