Sri Lanka sells 2028, 2029 bonds, 2034 bids rejected

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has sold raised 245 billion rupees from a bond auction and rejected all bids for 2034 bonds, data from the state debt office showed as rates spiked over the past few weeks amid political uncertainty.

The debt office sold all offered 100 million rupees of Feb 15, 2028 bonds at a weighted average yield of 13.79 percent.

Out of 150 billion rupees of 15 June 2029 bonds 145.96 billion were sold at a weighted average yield of 13.98 percent, rejecting other bids.

No bids were accepted for 40 billion rupees of 15 September 2034 bonds.

Sri Lanka’s presidential election is due on September 21, and investors are unwilling to buy longer term bonds.

Political parties have promised tax cuts and extra spending, while a domestic bond restructure has also been criticized, leading to uncertainty in bond markets and unwillingness to hold longer tenors. (Colombo/Aug12/2024)
