Italian father and son fined Rs. 60 mln over attempt to smuggle endemic insects from Yala

An Italian father and his son have been fined Rs. 60 million (approximately 200,000 USD) for attempting to smuggle hundreds of endemic insects, including 92 species of butterflies, from Yala National Park.

This fine is reportedly the highest ever imposed for a wildlife crime in Sri Lanka.

The decision was recently delivered by Tissamaharama Magistrate Tharindu Sameera de Silva.

The two Italians, 68-year-old Luigi Ferrari and his 28-year-old son, were arrested on May 8 this year by Yala National Park rangers with several jars containing the insects.

Initially, 810 charges were brought against them, but this was later reduced to 304.

The defense, represented by a team of lawyers from various regions, requested for leniency and the imposing of a minimum fine on their clients.

However, the Magistrate stated that the case was expedited and the necessary expert reports were swiftly obtained as the defendants are foreign nationals.

The court ruled that the defendants were guilty of all 304 charges under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance.

The court ordered the accused to pay the fine by September 29 and they are prohibited from leaving the country until the full amount is paid.
