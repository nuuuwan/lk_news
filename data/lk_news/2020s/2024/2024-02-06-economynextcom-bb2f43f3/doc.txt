Sri Lanka disaster management plan to be presented in parliament

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has formulated a national disaster management plan, which will be tabled in parliament for approval, cabinet spokesman Bandula Gunawardena said.

“A comprehensive national disaster management plan for 2023-2030 has been formulated taking into account the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the sustainable development goals, and conventions on climate change, and working with relevant institutions,” Gunawardena said. “This will be tabled in parliament for approval.”

Gunawardena said that with the possibility of extreme weather conditions increasing, a broad national disaster action plan was important.

According to World Bank data, disasters such as floods, cyclones and landslides are most common in Sri Lanka, with 151,885 people being affected by floods in the year 2020.

“A rise in extreme events and natural disasters as a result of climate change is expected to pose considerable threat to Sri Lanka’s economy and human health,” the World Bank said. (Colombo/Feb6/2024)
