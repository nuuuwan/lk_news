Sri Lanka needs policies to increase rubber production, make use of FTAs: Michelin

ECONOMYNEXT – Global tyre manufacturer Michelin has said the Sri Lanka government needs to implement proactive policies to increase rubber production in the island to provide impetus to value-added rubber products, and take steps to expand market access through free trade agreements.

A team from Michelin met Sri Lanka’s Export Development Board officials last week (Nov 1) to discuss further opportunities in the island nation’s rubber manufacturing sector.

“The representatives of Michelin pointed out that the government needs to implement proactive policies to increase rubber production in Sri Lanka to provide impetus to value-added rubber products while taking initiatives to expand market access through FTAs,” a statement by the EDB said.

“They also stressed the necessity of establishing a dedicated rubber zone to manufacture different types of rubber products in the island.”

The delegation comprised Eric Le Corre – Corporate Vice President, Public Affairs of Michelin Headquarters based in France, Koenraad Pringiers – Consultant, Public Affairs, and Nilanthi Weliwe – Head of Legal Affairs from Michelin’s local facility.

The Michelin group has 123 production sites in 26 countries and has a commercial presence in 170 countries with 125,000 employees worldwide.

In Asia, Michelin has a strong presence in countries such as Thailand, China, India, and Sri Lanka.

The French multinational entered Sri Lanka in 2018 and commenced operations in 2019 through the acquisition of Camso-Loadstar. The Company has been manufacturing and exporting agricultural and industrial solid tires, tracks and has nearly 6,000 employees throughout the island. (Colombo/Nov5/2024)
