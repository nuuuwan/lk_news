Vadivel Suresh and Ali Zahir Moulana given ministerial posts

Badulla District MP Vadivel Suresh has been appointed as the State Minister of Labour.

Meanwhile, MP Ali Zahir Moulana has been appointed as the Non Cabinet Minister of Development Projects.

They were sworn in before President Ranil Wickremesinghe today (21).

Vadivel Suresh had been elected to the parliament in the 2020 general election from the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) representing the Badulla District.

However, he was removed from his position as the SJBâ€™s Passara Organiser in November last year in the wake of the parliamentarian voting in favour of the 2024 Budget during the second reading.

On December 6, 2023, Suresh was appointed as Advisor to President Ranil Wickremesinghe on the full integration of up-country Tamils into Sri Lankan society.

Meanwhile, Ali Zahir Moulana of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) had been sworn in as a Member of Parliament on October 17, to fill the seat left vacant following the removal of former minister Naseer Ahamed.

Last week, the SLMC Deputy Leader had met and pledged his support to President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the upcoming Presidential Election.
