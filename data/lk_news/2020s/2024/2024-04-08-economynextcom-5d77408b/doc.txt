Sri Lanka plans politically correct names for Avurudu games

ECONOMYNEXT – Names of traditional New Year games which are considered to denigrate disabled people will be renamed with more acceptable labels, State Minister of Social Empowerment Anupa Pasqual said.

One of the games is kana mutti, where a blind-folded person tries to smash a hanging clay pot with a club. Kana is an impolite term for a blind person.

“Special focus has been directed towards the differently-abled community, with efforts aimed at reforming societal attitudes. Traditional practices like “Kana Muttiya Bindeema” and “Andhayata Kiri Kaweema”, organizers are encouraged to adopt the names “Vasana Muttiya Bindeema” and “Sagayata Kiri Kaweema,” Minister Pasqual said.

“This initiative aims to foster a shift in societal perceptions. Additionally, numerous special programs have been arranged for the differently-abled community during all festive occasions throughout the year.”

The traditional new year is a solar festival celebrated by Sri Lanka’s sinhala and tamil communities.

It is celebrated in India and former territories of the Chola Empire including Sri Lanka (avurudu), and Thailand (sonkram).
