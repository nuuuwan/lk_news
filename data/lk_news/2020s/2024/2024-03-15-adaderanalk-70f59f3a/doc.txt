Fifteen Indian fishermen apprehended while poaching in Sri Lankan waters

Sri Lanka Navy says it has apprehended 15 Indian fishermen who were poaching in the sea areas off Jaffna.

The Indian fishermen were taken into custody during a special operation mounted by the Northern Naval Command deployed Fast Attack Craft to chase away a cluster of Indian poaching trawlers from Sri Lankan waters in the early hours of Friday (March 15).

Having spotted illegal fishing activities off the Kovilan Lighthouse in Karainagar, the naval personnel managed to impound an Indian trawler with 15 fishermen aboard.

The seized Indian vessel and the fishermen were subsequently brought ashore to the Kankesanturai Harbour and are slated to be handed over to the Mailadi Fisheries Inspector for onward legal proceedings.

Following the new development, the navy says it has intercepted a total of 16 Indian fishing trawlers thus far in 2024 for trespassing in Sri Lankan waters. As many as 125 Indian fishermen were also apprehended in these operations.
