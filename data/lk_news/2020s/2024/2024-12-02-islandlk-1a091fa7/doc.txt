Bangladesh Employers’ Federation praises Employers’ Federation of Ceylon

A delegation representing the Bangladesh Employers Federation (BEF) recently concluded a two-day exchange program in Sri Lanka, organized under the initiative of the Bureau for Employers’ Activities (ACT/EMP) Dheli of the International Labour Organization (ILO) hosted by the Employers’ Federation of Ceylon (EFC).

The delegation comprised of six officials from BEF, accompanied by three ILO officials. The purpose of the program was to provide a comprehensive understanding of how the Federation works and strengthens its legal services by catering to the requirements of its membership.

During the visit, the delegation was introduced to the activities of the EFC, its membership strength and the broad spectrum of services provided by it, with special focus on litigation services.

The programme also included a visit to a Labour Tribunal where the delegation observed its proceedings and a meeting with the Commissioner General of Labour. These visits provided insights of the multifaceted roles played by the EFC.

Expressing his heartfelt appreciation the Secretary General and CEO of BEF remarked that, “This has been a tremendous learning opportunity, equipping the team with insights that will significantly enhance their in-house legal capacities.”
