Not possible to suspend liquor license for long: State Minister

Parliament, April 2 (Daily Mirror)- It is not possible to suspend liquor licenses for a long period as the government loses revenue in such an eventuality, State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya told Parliament today.

The State Minister said this in response to an allegation by Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa that licenses have been given back to liquor companies even before they had settled the default taxes.

Also, the State Minister said the ground situation with regard to the tax default is different from what has been revealed by the Ways and Means Committee.
