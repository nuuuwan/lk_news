Sri Lanka state bus system looks to e-ticketing to combat revenue leaks

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is promoting e-ticketing for state buses to stop revenue theft by bus conductors, Minister of Transport Bandula Gunawardana said.

“Some conductors take a portion of the money home,” Gunawardana told reporters Wednesday.

“The take home amount is 10 million rupees daily, or 100 lakhs, which together becomes 3 billion a year.

“So therefore, I have struggled to implement e-ticketing from the moment I took this responsibility.”

However, Minister Gunawardana said that there has been opposition from transportation workers with some of them setting up committees and taking the matter to court as citizens.

Many workers are honest, but there are some who are not, in the same way most passengers buy tickets but some travel without, he said.

“If they make an e-reservation, some guards don’t like it,” Gunawardana said. “They take a 5,000-rupee ticket and sell it to the tourists for 30,000 rupees. They don’t let us do it online.”

“About 35 bus conductors are interdicted each day for siphoning off passenger revenues,” he said.

“The private bus owners have solved this problem in this way,” he said. “They give the bus to the driver and conductor and tell them to run it as they wish.

“They say at the end of the day give us this amount of money.” (Colombo/Apr03/2024)
