Russian Embassy criticises Western double standards on human rights in SL

The Russian Embassy in Colombo in a statement yesterday slammed the double standards of “numerous Western political figures, diplomats and foreign quasi-human rights organisations” concerning human rights in Sri Lanka.

“In spite of the fact that the above-mentioned personalities and entities are well known for their policy of double standards, the Embassy as the official representation of the Russian Federation would like once again to express its perplexity by the way those ‘ambassadors of justice’ see things,” it said.

The Embassy highlighted increased external pressure on Sri Lanka regarding its human rights situation, with Western political figures, diplomats, and foreign quasi-human rights organisations issuing critical statements and observations.  “Why are they reticent about the Gaza situation? Why don’t they provide their assessments of the humanitarian damage NATO caused to Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Libya and other regions to which the Alliance aims to export its ‘freedom and democracy’? What prevents them from looking into the matter of Russian-speaking minorities being oppressed in Baltic countries? Why do they finally omit and even indulge the atrocities by the Nazi regime of Zelenskyy in respect of his own people?” it asked.

The Russian Embassy remarked that although partial answers to these questions are known, the public community desires to hear them clearly and unequivocally.
