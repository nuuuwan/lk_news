Benchmarks of Sri Lanka’s IMF agreement cannot be changed: president

ECONOMYNEXT — The benchmarks, revenue and expenditure figures agreed to with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cannot be changed, Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.

At a Q&A with heads of media organisations held on Wednesday August 07, Wickremesinghe said the IMF has not changed their position on benchmarks agreed to with any country.

“We have entered an agreement with the IMF, and we have to implement it. If we implement it as we go along, there won’t be a problem for Sri Lanka,” he said.

Wickremesinghe was responding to a question about statements made by opposition parties that they would renegotiate the terms of Sri Lanka’s IMF agreement.

“Now others are coming up with various proposals, that they want to change. Then they must tell what they’re going to do. One thing about the IMF is that the benchmarks will not be changed. They have never changed it for any country,” he said.

“The benchmarks are there. For instance, you want to give something free from some place and you want to increase VAT to 25 percent. If the numbers are agreeable, they will say yes. But you can’t change the benchmarks and the revenue figures and the expenditure figures,” he said.
