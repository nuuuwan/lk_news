Active in Dubai

Seven Notes, made up of Sri Lankan musicians, based in Dubai, are doing exceptionally well in the scene over there, with work coming their way on a regular basis.

On August 3rd, 2024, the band was at the Golden Mercury Hotel’s V Club performing at ‘Mandakini Chapter 2.’

Presented by Seven Notes themselves, the night, I’m told, featured a stellar lineup of artistes, including Sirasa TV’s The Voice Teen sensation, Yenuli Neriah, and Dubai’s renowned vocalist, Pasindu Udayanga, as well as talented performers Rishi and Rajith.

This event was organized by Seven Notes bassist Niluk Uswaththa.

Seven Notes will also be seen in action at more events, coming up in September.
