Dayasiri claims Sajith leading Presidential opinion polls

Humane People’s Alliance leader MP Dayasiri Jayasekara asserted in a press conference yesterday that Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa is currently leading in public opinion polls for the upcoming Presidential election.

According to Jayasekara, National People’s Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumar Dissanayake follows in second place, with current President Ranil Wickremesinghe trailing in third.

MP Dayasiri Jayasekara commented on the President’s plan to declare Sri Lanka free from bankruptcy on 27 June, emphasising that such an announcement should be made by international credit rating agencies. He pointed out that Sri Lanka remains in a crisis, grappling with both old and new debts, while sovereign bond holders have been reluctant to agree to the government’s proposed debt reduction percentages. “Reports indicate they are only willing to reduce the debt by 10%,” he added.

Jayasekara criticised the Government for ongoing allegations of theft, fraud, and corruption. He accused those close to the President of embezzling national assets to safeguard their own interests. He stressed the urgent need for a political movement with a robust agenda capable of rebuilding the country. Jayasekara highlighted pervasive corruption across society, the public sector, and political circles, lamenting that these forces are collectively undermining the nation.

“We require a Government with a fresh strategy to combat this,” he asserted. The MP underscored the importance of the public remembering instances of theft and fraud during the previous government’s tenure, even amid bankruptcy, and in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna and former ministers. Jayasekara further stated that if a group responsible for plundering the country’s resources seeks to return to power without regard for the people’s welfare during times of financial distress it would spell doom for the country. He urged consideration of better alternatives for the country’s future.
