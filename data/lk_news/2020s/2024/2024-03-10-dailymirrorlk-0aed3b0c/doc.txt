Sajith listening to outsiders and ignoring SJB members: Ranil

Kuliyapitiya, March 10 (Daily Mirror) - Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa is ignoring members of his own party and is listening to outsiders. This is why he decided not to participate in the debt restructuring process, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.

President Wickremesinghe told a UNP rally in Kuliyapitiya that Sajith Premadasa had actually started ignoring and sidelining his own party members like Dr. Harsha de Silva.

“Dr. De Silva requested me to involve the Opposition in the debt restructuring process. Accordingly, I invited the SJB to join us in meeting the IMF and the debtors. However, Premadasa informed me that his party is not willing to participate in those meetings. It was MP G.L. Peiris who has encouraged Premadasa to ignore my request. Premadasa has actually begun to ignore his own party members. The SJB is controlled by outsiders. Therefore, I invite those who opposed me in the past to join us,” the President said.
