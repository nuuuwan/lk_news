Foreigners to be offered driving license at airport, demerit system from April

ECONOMYNEXT – Foreigners entering Sri Lanka will be able to obtain a driving license at the airport from April 15, State Minister of Transport Lasantha Alagiyawanna has said.

“In collaboration with the Department of Immigration and Emigration, Civil Aviation Authority and the Ministry of Tourism, arrangements are being made to obtain a driving license in Sri Lanka for foreigners seeking to have them,” State Minister Alagiyawanna told a press briefing at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Friday.

“They can now apply for it directly at the airport from April 15th. All necessary arrangements have been made to facilitate the issuance of the driving license upon their departure from the airport.”

The fees for obtaining a driving license are as follows: USD 25 for one month, USD 50 for three months, USD 75 for six months, and USD 200 for a year or longer.

Additionally, from April 10 the demerit points system will take effect in the country, Alagiyawanna said.

“Post offices handling traffic violation fines will transmit details such as the offense’s nature, the respective police station, driving license particulars, and contact number to the National Council for Road Safety’s data system. Using this information, the National Council for Road Safety will send text messages and accident-related videos to the relevant phone numbers through WhatsApp.”

Alagiyawanna said that various projects were also in place to curb road accidents. He said it was important to promote awareness to reduce traffic accidents at the school level. The Ministry of Education, Ministry of Transport, and Ministry of Public Security will launch road safety forums in every school from April 3. (Colombo/Mar22/2024)
