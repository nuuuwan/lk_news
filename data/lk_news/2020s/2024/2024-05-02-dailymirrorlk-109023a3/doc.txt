World press freedom day: The rights and the wrongs

Historically and traditionally, democracy’s four pillars have been the Executive, legislature, judiciary and the press or media. In recent years, social media has also come to the scene largely with dramatic reports, some of which are alternative facts, twisted reports or outright lies, as we see.

The United States’ Republican Party Presidential candidate, Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November while he faces more than a hundred criminal charges relating to malpractice, misappropriation of millions of dollars and the campaigning of outright lies and downright distortions regarding various issues including that of millions of migrants. In a widely publicised interview with the Time Magazine this week, Trump, the far-right extremist, did not hide the fact that he wants to turn the US into a white authoritarian regime.

In this backdrop, the UN, tomorrow, May 3, marks World Press Freedom Day stating that it is a day dedicated to the importance of journalism and freedom of expression in the context of the current global environmental crisis. According to the UN, awareness of all aspects of the global environmental crisis and its consequences is essential to build democratic societies and journalistic work is indispensable for this purpose.

While journalists across the world fight for their right to disseminate information, one of the major challenges they are also faced with is combating the misleading and false information related to climate change.

In this regard, the UN adds that dis-/misinformation campaigns challenge knowledge and scientific research methods. Attacks on the validity of science pose a serious threat to pluralistic and informed public debate. Misleading and false information about climate change can, in some cases, undermine international efforts to address them.

The UN says, dis-/misinformation about environmental issues can lead to a lack of public and political support for climate action, effective policies, and the protection of vulnerable communities affected by climate change, as well as of women and girls, as climate change tends to exacerbate existing inequalities.

To achieve sustainable development, the UN underscores that it is necessary for journalists to report accurately, timely, and comprehensively on environmental issues and their consequences, as well as on possible solutions. Accordingly, the UN identifies that it requires a comprehensive strategy that includes: Preventing and protecting against crimes committed against journalists; ensuring the rights to freedom of expression, freedom of scientific research, and access to key sources of information, in addition to combating dis-/misinformation through journalism; promoting the plurality, diversity, and viability of media; ensuring that the governance of digital platforms foster the transparency of technology companies, their accountability, due diligence, user empowerment, and content moderation and curation based on international human rights’ standards; and promoting Media and Information Literacy programs to empower users with skills to engage and think critically in the digital environment.

Delving into the origins and the purpose of the day, the UN noted that the World Press Freedom Day was proclaimed by the UN General Assembly in December 1993, following the recommendation of UNESCO’s General Conference. Since then, May 3, the anniversary of the Declaration of Windhoek, which is considered a benchmark for ensuring press freedom around the world, has been celebrated worldwide as World Press Freedom Day. After 30 years, the historic connection made between the freedom to seek, impart and receive information and the public good remains as relevant as it was at the time of its signing.

May 3 no doubt acts as a reminder to governments of the need to respect their commitment to press freedom. It is also a day of reflection among media professionals about issues of press freedom and professional ethics. It is an opportunity to celebrate the fundamental principles of press freedom, assess the state of press freedom throughout the world, defend the media from attacks on their independence and pay tribute to journalists who have lost their lives in the line of duty.

One of the world’s greatest statesmen, Mahatma Gandhi, has said, “Freedom of the press is a precious privilege that no country can forego.’’ Meanwhile, an equally great statesman, Nelson Mandela, has said, “A free press is one of the pillars of democracy.”
