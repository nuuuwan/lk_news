Sri Lanka Nanu Oya Railway facelift to be completed with Tourist Board funds

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka plans to develop the picturesque hill country Nanu Oya Railway Station with Tourism Development Authority funds, Cabinet Spokesperson minister Bandula Gunawardena said.

“The initial value of the modernization project was 74.63 million rupees, but this has increased to 101.81 million rupees due to the cost of building materials rising,” Gunawardena told reporters on Tuesday.

“The funds will be taken from the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau while another portion of funds will be taken from the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority and the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau,” Gunawardena said.

The Nanu Oya Railway station attracts both local and international travelers vacationing in Nuwara Eliya and other hill country towns. (Colombo/Jul16/2024)
