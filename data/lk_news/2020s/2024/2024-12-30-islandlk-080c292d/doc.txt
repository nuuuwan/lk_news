Big scene for Ishini & The Branch

The festive season has been extra special for Ishini & The Branch as the spotlight has been focused on them on numerous occasions…and now they are in the Maldives, keeping the folks in that part of the world entertained.

This is what the group’s dynamic female vocalist, Ishini Fonseka, had to say about their Christmas Eve performance: “What a beautiful audience! What a beautiful country.”

They had to travel by seaplane to their destination (tourist resort) in the Maldives.

Before their departure for the Maldives, Ishini & The Branch were seen and heard at most of the top venues, in Colombo.

In addition to Ishini & The Branch, singer Sajith Gunaratna is in the Maldives, as well, with his band N-Chord, performing at Mercure Maldives Kooddoo Resort.
