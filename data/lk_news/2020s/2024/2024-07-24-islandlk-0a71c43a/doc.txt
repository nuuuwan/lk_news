Universities and liberal arts education – II

(First part of this article appeared in The Island of 23 July 2024)

Let us be clear about liberal arts. They are not confined to language and literature studies. Recall, Francis Bacon (author of Novum Organon): ‘Nature is an open book but to read it you need the language of mathematics’. In addition to what Professor Amarakirthi deals with, liberal arts include mathematics, natural sciences and moral sciences (social studies). An education in liberal arts does not train a student for any profession. The leading liberal arts colleges in Us (Barnard, Harvard, Princeton, Swarthmore, Pomona, Dartmouth and others) all teach these subjects. Some of them (Swarthmore) teach engineering. Princeton University does not have any professional schools (business, law or medicine) as a part of it. The two old universities in England took a long time to start any professional schools. There is no evidence to maintain that learning in mathematics, science, economics, politics and history has dulled the wit of scholars who studied them. On the contrary. Some of the sharpest criticisms of society have come from mathematicians, scientists, economists, historians and students of politics. The pathology must lie somewhere else.

IN many universities, the world over, students begin studies relating to professions after high school. In Sri Lanka, students begin medical, engineering or business studies, directly after completing high school. In India, students can enter IITs directly after high school. Mathematics and basic sciences are learnt before training in the professions begins. In Germany, there are Technische Hochschulen. In US and many European universities, students need a first degree to pursue professional studies. In France, there are Polytechniques where professions are taught. Teachers and researchers have shifted their interest from liberal arts to professional courses. Chintaka Ranasinghe of Kelaniya, in a recent address to Samskrti, informed that students who came to study Sinhala in our universities were those in remote villages who were handicapped by a lack of options, which forced them to take Sinhala and related subjects against their better judgment. There is a report today (13/07/24) that at the National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan (third in rank) ‘no student had accepted places in the history department for next year (2025)’. This is a threat that liberal arts departments in universities worldwide face. Language and literature departments in many universities (I recall the instance in the university of Verginia) have contracted in size and sometimes integrated with some social studies departments.

A few words on the method (methodology for those who like long words) of treating the subject by Professor Amarakirthi. He quotes, at length, the opinions of celebrated writers and scholars who support his contentions. These are not substitutes for analytical studies of institutions, including their functioning.

Problems of financing higher education and the consequences of different methods used have given rise to many issues including closing opportunities to those in lower income categories. They are entirely missing from the book. Two books of interest in this area are Henry Rosovsky, University: an owner’s manual (1990) and Richard V. Reeves, Dreams Hoarders (2017). Methods of financing and cultural factors have tended to perpetuate and engender lasting inequalities in access to university education. One also should re-consider the usefulness of the lengthy digression on Gardener’ celebrated paper in his critique of IQ tests. Similarly, neo-liberalism is a political philosophy, dealing with the individual and society. Neo-liberalism seeks to minimize the role of government and widen the role of civil society, including the market. (It has been widely and roundly criticized.) This has no bearing on liberal arts education: liberal arts are taught in both state and non-state universities. The importance of education in economic growth came into prominence in the 1960s following a path-breaking paper written by Robert Solow. Neo-liberalism has little to do with it. Magna Carta was a charter issued by King John who sought new revenue to set out on a crusade and ‘barons of the realm’, in a bargain, obtained certain privileges including ‘No man shall be seized or imprisoned or suspended of his rights or possessions ……..except by the lawful judgment of his equals or the law of the land’. We still go to court seeking a writ of habeas corpus. It was not an ex parte declaration comparable to the declaration referred to in this book.

For those interested in universities, here are a few publications, I have used. In Sinhala, there is the Visvavidyala Ankaya of Samskrti, Volume 12, No.4 (1965) edited by young Susil Sirivardana and S.G.Samarasinghe. I spoke about it in on Radio Ceylon in 1967 and a fragment of that talk was published in Samskrti in 2014. Susil Sirivardana and Usvatte-aratchi re-issued the visvavidyala adyapana ankaya with a new introduction written by Usvatte-aratchi in 2014. Samskrti over time published many articles on university education. japanaye usas adyapanaya (1971) is an excellent translation into Sinhala by Professor W.A.de Silva of Nagai Michio’s Higher Education in Japan and is useful both for information and vocabulary. Usvatte-aratchi also wrote a longish essay on universities in a collection samajaya, arthikaya ha adyapanaya (2009). I read in Peradeniya in 1955 Hastings Rashdall’s three volumes on Medieval Universities and Abraham Flexners’s Universities: American, English and German. They are probably there still. There appeared in 1988 an excellent companion to Rashdall: A History of the University of Cambridge Volume I by Damien Rehl Leader. Universities, for all their glittering modernity, are essentially medieval institutions (like parliament and trial by jury). They cannot be understood by beginning with Harvard College which opened 1635. (The public school which the immigrants started in 1633, Boston Grammar School still thrives.) On modern American universities, papers and books abound. A good summary though dated) is in American Higher Education by Christopher J. Lucas (1940.) On universities that Britain exported (to Ceylon, as well) the best source is Eric Ashby’s Universities: British, Indian and African. The British Council Library in Colombo ordered it in 1970 at my request. On European universities, there are many books and papers; the one volume I use is The Emergence of Modern Universities, 1863- 1914 by George Weisz. On Japan, Michio Nagai’s work is reliable. I am poor on universities in Latin America, mostly because I do not read Spanish. There are reports of commissions and committees appointed by governments to report on universities. Radhakrishnan Commission in India in 1948 was excellent. Needham Commission Report in 1958 in our country should also be looked at. The outstanding Robbins Committee Report on Higher Education, 1960 running into several volumes is unexcelled as a source of information. In many countries which gained independence from colonial rule Malaysia, Ghana, Nigeria and Zambia appointed commissions to report on the establishment of universities. Among academic journals, Minerva edited by Edward Shills from Chicago was available in the Peradeniya library. Professor Amarakirthi is not an infrequent visitor to the US, where he can read these in any good library. I wrote this brief because they are conspicuously absent from the reading list in his book.

Professor Amarakirthi is a highly regarded teacher of literature. He has reached the highest level in the academic hierarchy. He is a prize-winning writer of fiction. He has written more books than most people read in their lifetime. He has been associated with five universities, three overseas. His companions, named in this book, include a brilliant galaxy of professors. Recently, he spoke on a political platform exhibiting considerable rhetorical talent. With all that, this book disappoints.

(Usvatte-aratchi is an economist. He writes in both English and Sinhala. He says his handwriting, which never had form, has of late deteriorated to an illegible scroll. He has failed to find a typist who could make a neat typescript from his drafts. He regrets that these notes were not written in Sinhala. He would be grateful if someone publishes them in Sinhala.)
