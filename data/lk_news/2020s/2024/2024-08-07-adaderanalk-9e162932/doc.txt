Agarwood, agar oil seized from Sri Lankan passengers at Chennai airport

The Customs Department at the Chennai airport on Tuesday have seized agarwood and agar oil worth around 04 million Indian rupees from two Sri Lankan passengers, Indian media reported.

The officials were conducting a security check for the passengers who had arrived from Colombo in Chennai on Tuesday night when they intercepted two Sri Lankan passengers on suspicion.

The duo, who was visiting Chennai on a tourist visa, appeared nervous and gave evasive replies. When the customs team searched their baggage, they found 20 kg of agarwood and 15 bottles of agar oil in them.

As it is illegal to carry agarwood without proper documentation, the Customs officials seized the contraband items.

The total value of the seized wood and oil is estimated to be at 4 million Indian rupees. Both passengers were arrested and further inquiry is on, according to the report on DTNext.

The aromatic agarwood is highly-prized for its use in the production of high-quality perfumes, particularly in European countries.
