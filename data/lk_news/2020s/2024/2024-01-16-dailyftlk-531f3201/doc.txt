Hayleys Solar, the renewable energy arm of Hayleys Fentons recently surpassed 150MWp of installations, a national record for rooftop solar PV capacity in Sri Lanka, setting a new milestone in the island’s transition to renewable energy.

By March 2023, Hayleys Solar crossed its milestone of 125MW and has continued to add new rooftop solar capacity to its portfolio, in various locations across the country. Its 150MWp of solar capacity is enabling Hayleys Solar to save close to 151,835 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions released to the air every year.

Expressing his views, Hayleys Fentons Managing Director Hasith Prematillake stated: “This achievement is the largest to be installed across the island by any single entity and supports us to empower the community making solar solutions closer to all via accessibility and affordability. We are grateful for the trust and support our customers have placed in us.”

Hayleys Solar continues to establish solar experience centres island-wide, adding to its portfolio of experience centres in Matara and Jaffna with new launches in Nawala, Katunayake, Kurunegala and Kandy soon, This will make it easier for people from different communities to access and learn about solar solutions.

These centres offer a comprehensive range of applications, including rooftop PV systems, batteries, and inverters, alongside live demonstrations of solar-powered water pumps, lighting systems and solar powered hot water systems.

With high electricity tariffs, Hayleys Solar offers easy payment plans and loan facilities to support affordability for households and businesses to transition to solar.

Hayleys Solar Executive Director and CEO Roshane Perera said, “By far, Hayleys Solar has become a top of mind household name and plays a major role as a trendsetter in the solar energy sphere as the undisputed market leader. Throughout our remarkable journey, we have empowered a diversified clientele including world-renowned organisations and thousands of households. We are very grateful to our loyal clientele who has placed their trust with us”

“We are also in the process of installing the largest battery of 2MWh which will be commissioned by January 2024. I believe it is our responsibility as the market leader to focus on innovation and bring in the latest technologies to drive growth to expand market share in this sector.”

In 2022, amid challenges in power availability, Hayleys Solar enabled the facilitation of a massive project of installing solar at 830 telecommunication towers across Sri Lanka, which supported the community to stay connected.

With its ongoing commitment to adding rooftop solar capacity to empower the community with electricity and energy self-sufficiency, Hayleys Solar is dedicated to improve the livelihoods of many Sri Lankans for generations.
