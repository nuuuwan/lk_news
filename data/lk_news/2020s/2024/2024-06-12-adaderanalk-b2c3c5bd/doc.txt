Fairly heavy showers expected in two provinces

The Department of Meteorology says showers will occur at times in Western, Sabaragamuwa and North-western provinces and in Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Galle and Matara districts.

Fairly heavy showers about 75 mm are likely at some places in Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces, it said.

Showers or thundershowers may occur at a few places in Uva province and Ampara, Batticaloa districts in the evening or night.

Strong winds of about 40-50 kmph can be expected at times over the Western slopes of the central hills, Northern, North-central, and North-western provinces and in Trincomalee, Hambantota and Monaragala districts.

The general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
