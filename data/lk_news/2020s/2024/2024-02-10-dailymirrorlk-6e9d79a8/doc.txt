Will not join 225 MPs to create parties or alliances: Janaka Ratnayake

Presidential hopeful Janaka Ratnayake said today that he and all civil organisations have decided not to join any of the 225 MPs in Parliament to form political alliances.

While signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the National Civil Organisation Front (NCOF) today, he said the public have rejected the 225 MPs, and he does not aspire to be one of them.

"Currently, civil organisations are carrying out a great national mission to rescue the country from where it has fallen.

"We named this mission as 'Rescue Sri Lanka'. The time has come for people to join hands with civil organisations to uplift the country and create a suitable environment to form a better leader," Ratnayaka said.

"A proper action plan will be introduced describing the correct and shortest way to restore the country.

"We reject the current ruling parties while not letting them have another chance to come to power.

"We need to create political parties and alliances that do not represent the current political parties. We need to join a political party in the future and create an alliance. But we will not join hands with existing political parties or with any of tge 225 MPs,‚Äù he added.
