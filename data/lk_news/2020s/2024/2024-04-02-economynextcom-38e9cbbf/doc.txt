Sri Lanka gives USD1mn to Gaza Children’s Fund

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has donated one million dollars to assist children impacted by Israel’s assault on Gaza.

The donation was formally transferred to the Government of Palestine through the United Nations’ official channel, on Monday, a statement by the president’s media division said.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe presented the cheque to Palestinian Ambassador in Sri Lanka Zuhair M H Zaid.

In addition, over 20 million rupees has been contributed to the “Children of Gaza Fund”. These funds are scheduled to be formally transferred to the Palestinian government in the coming days.

Anyone interested in contributing could do so before April 30, by depositing money to the Bank of Ceylon (Account number: 7040016), Taprobane Branch (Branch code: 747). Donors are requested to send the relevant deposit receipt via Whatsapp to 077-9730396.

The primary source of aid to Gaza comes from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions, mostly from government donors. But allegations by Israel have seen several key donors withhold funding at this critical point. (Colombo/Apr2/2024)
