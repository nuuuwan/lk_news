Colombo, April 12 (Daily Mirror) - There is no political interference in the programme of providing 10 kgs of rice to about 3 million low-income families at the cost of Rs. 12 billion, Finance State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

Addressing the media at the Ruwanwella area today, he assured that the preparation of the lists of beneficiaries under the programme of providing 10 kgs of rice will be done without any influence by its officials under the supervision of the Regional Secretaries.

"Many people believe that we should expand the social safety net to support those who have fallen below the poverty line. The Minister agreed and said that steps are being taken in this direction. Additionally, he highlighted that the subsidy amount, which was Rs. 65 billion two years ago, has now been increased significantly to Rs. 205 billion.

"The government hopes to provide some relief to low-income earners through the rice distribution programme and also to provide some guidance to provide a fair price to rice farmers by increasing the demand for rice," added Minister Siyambalapitiya.

Also, the Minister mentioned that 10 kilos of rice will be provided to three million low-income families each month as well as on May 10.
