Tharushi Karunaratne’s track kit to feature in Switzerland’s Olympic Museum

The track kit worn by Sri Lankan athlete Tharushi Karunaratne has been donated to be displayed at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland.

The kit, autographed by 19-year-old Karunaratne is slated to be displayed in the Olympic Museum in honour of being the youngest athlete who represented the Asian region in the Women’s 800m event.

Accordingly, this also creates history as the first-ever track kit worn by a Sri Lankan athlete to be featured in the Olympic Museum.

The handing over of autographed kit to the International Olympic Committee officials was carried out during a special ceremony held in the Paris Olympics village.
