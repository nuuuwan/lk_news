Vocational training for students who have sat their A/L exams

English language guidance for students who have sat for their Advanced Level (A/L) examinations this year will also be given an opportunity to study a vocational subject of their choice free of charge from March 5, Education Minister Susil Premajayantha said.

This training programme will be implemented at 300 centres around the country.

Meanwhile, it has been planned to implement the same type of training programmes soon after the end of the GCE Ordinary Level (O/L) examinations as well.

Also, the Minister said that all teachers in schools should be well equipped with the knowledge on information technology.

He also pointed out that a wide programme has been implemented to train teachers through computer resource centres established in each region.

The current number of computer resource centres is 100 and arrangements have already been made to increase these by seventeen more in the future.

Computer training is provided to teachers and steps have been taken to prepare a regional level software development team.
