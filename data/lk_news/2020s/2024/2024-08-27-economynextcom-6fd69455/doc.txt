Favourability ratings of Sri Lanka’s AKD, Ranil improve; Ranil’s surpasses Sajith’s

ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka leftist leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake and President Ranil Wickrmesinghe saw their net favourability rating rise in July, with the latter surpassing opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, according to an independent poll.

The Institute for Health Policy (IHP) in its Sri Lanka Opinion Tracker Survey (SLOTS) for July found that the net favourability rating of Dissanayake rose 29 points from June to reach +3. President Wickremesinghe’s favourability improved 40 points to -24 surpassing Premadasa whose rating changed little, from -42 in June to -44 in July.

IHP said in a statement on Tuesday August 27 that favourability estimates for each month are based on 100–500 interviews conducted during that month and a few weeks before and after to ensure a minimum set of responses. The July 2024 estimates are based on 400 (Premadasa), 378 (Dissanayake), 406 (Wickremesinghe) and 180 (former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa) interviews.

“We have noted that some members of the public misunderstand media reporting of these numbers. Negative scores, i.e., a net favourability rating of less than zero, means that the individual or institution is unpopular. Only positive scores, i.e., net favourability is more than zero, mean that the individual or institution is popular on average,” IHP said.

“IHP is an independent, non-partisan research centre based in Colombo, Sri Lanka. The SLOTS lead investigator is Dr Ravi Rannan-Eliya of IHP, who has trained in public opinion polling at Harvard University and has conducted numerous surveys over three decades.”

The institute said that SLOTS surveys a national sample of adults (ages 18 and over) reached by random digit dialling of mobile numbers, and others coming from a national panel of respondents who were previously recruited through random selection.

“SLOTS tracks favourability by asking respondents if they have a favourable or unfavourable opinion of a public figure or institution: net favourability being the average of the positive (+100) and negative (-100) responses. All estimates are weighted to match the national population with respect to age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, sector, province and past voting preference. Monthly estimates are based on samples of 100+ interviews pooled from interviews in each month and from weeks before and afterwards. As the July update uses a more recent data set than the previous update, there are small changes in estimates of favourability ratings for previous months.”

The SLOTS survey has previously been funded by the Neelan Tiruchelvam Trust, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), The Asia Foundation in Sri Lanka, and others. Current field work is financed by the IHP Public Interest Research Fund and others. The sponsors play no role in the study design, analysis, or interpretation of findings, IHP said.
