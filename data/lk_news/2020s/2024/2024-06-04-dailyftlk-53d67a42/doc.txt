The Education Ministry has announced that all schools in five districts, along with those in the Homagama, Kelaniya and Kaduwela Educational Zone, will remain closed today (4) due to severe weather conditions.

All schools in affected districts of Ratnapura, Kegalle, Kalutara, Matara and Galle will be closed today. The closure aims to ensure the safety of students and staff as the country continues to experience heavy rainfall and potential flooding, landslide warnings and evacuation.Â  Schools in other districts and educational zones will reopen today as scheduled.

The decision follows a special holiday declared for all schools yesterday (3) in response to the adverse weather.

The Ministry will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as necessary. Separately, the Examinations Department announced that the commencement of the 2023 G.C.E. examination paper marking is postponed till 8 June, considering the difficulties that examiners might experience in reaching the evaluation centres amid adverse weather conditions countrywide.
