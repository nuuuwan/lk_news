Dettol, a leading global health and hygiene brand, introduced its latest Skincare soap to the Sri Lankan market with a grand celebration. The launch event, named “Dettol Beauty Pink Night,” was a glamorous affair, featuring Sri Lanka’s first influencer ramp walk.

This extraordinary occasion drew some of the country’s most beloved and influential female social media personalities, including Rozanne Diasz, a renowned figure in Sri Lankan fashion and modeling, and Hasini Gunasekara, a prominent beautician and entrepreneur.
