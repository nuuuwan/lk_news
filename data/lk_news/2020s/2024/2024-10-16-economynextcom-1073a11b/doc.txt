Sri Lanka looks to Cuba for drug production help

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya has discussed Cuban investment in the production of pharmaceuticals at a meeting with the socialist country’s ambassador.

Cuban Ambassador to Sri Lanka Andres Marcelo González Gorrido has said that the Cuban government is paying attention to the production of medicines in Sri Lanka, according to a statement by the PM’s office.

The Caribbean country looked forward to “further strengthening of the nearly 65-year long diplomatic relationship between Sri Lanka and Cuba, resumption of the stalled mosquito control projects implemented under Cuban aid, including training of Sri Lankan trainers and students in medical and sports education for universities.”

Gorrido conveyed the best wishes of the Cuban government to the prime minister when he met her on Tuesday (15).

Amarasuriya thanked the ambassador for Cuba’s continued support despite the economic challenges faced by Cuba in the past few years, and extended an official invitation to the Cuban Prime Minister to visit Sri Lanka. (Colombo/Oct16/2024)
