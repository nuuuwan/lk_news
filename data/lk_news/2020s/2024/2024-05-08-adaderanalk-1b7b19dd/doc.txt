Injunction preventing removal of Amaraweera and others from SLFP posts extended

The court order issued preventing the Executive Committee of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) from removing party members Mahinda Amaraweera, Duminda Dissanayake, and Lasantha Alagiyawanna from their respective positions has been extended.

Accordingly, the interim injunction will be in effect until 15 May on the orders of the Colombo District Court.

The attorneys who appeared for the respondents before the court, requested for permission to file objections regarding the relevant plaint.

Thus, the court, which allowed the respondents’ party to file objections related to the plaint, ordered the petition to be recalled on May 15, 2024.

A group of individuals including former President Maithripala Sirisena and Acting General Secretary of SLFP Sarathi Dushmantha Mithrapala have been named as respondents of the relevant plaint, which have sought an order declaring that the decision taken by the party’s executive committee to expel them without any disciplinary investigation to be unlawful.

The Executive Committee of the SLFP decided to remove Dissanayake, Alagiyawanna and Amaraweera from their respective positions in the party, during a special party meeting held on March 30.

Accordingly, Dissanayake was stripped of his post as the National Organizer, Alagiyawanna was removed as the Treasurer and Amaraweera as the Senior Vice President.
