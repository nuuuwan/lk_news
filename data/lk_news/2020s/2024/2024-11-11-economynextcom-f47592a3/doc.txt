Sri Lanka President reveals IMF review, budget timelines

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka President Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the government expects to complete the third review for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan by early February 2025 and present a full year budget in the same month.

The third IMF review was to be completed by October, but the parliament election has delayed the process after the September 21 presidential poll and upcoming Thursday parliamentary election.

“Two days after the (Parliament) election, an IMF delegation will come to Sri Lanka. We will complete the third review by the end of January or early February,” the President said in Sri Lanka’s Western district of Gampaha when he addressed a parliamentary election campaign meeting.

“We will present a vote-on-account for four months in December. We expect to approve a new budget in February.”

“In the budget, we will reduce PAYE tax in a fair manner. Similarly, we will definitely raise the wages of government servants.”

President Dissanayake’s interim government with a three-member cabinet came under strong criticism due to not fulfilling promises his party made during the presidential election including tax reduction, wage hike, and renegotiating the IMF deal.

However, the new government has said it will implement its election pledges after it receives a mandate in the parliament polls. (Colombo/November 11/2024)
