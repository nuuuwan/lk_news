Driving licenses for hearing-impaired community

The Cabinet of Ministers has approved a resolution to issue light-vehicle driving licenses to hearing-impaired persons island-wide on a biannual renewal basis.

Previously, a pilot project was carried out to issue light-vehicle driving licenses to the hearing-impaired community in the Gampaha District, in accordance with the Cabinet resolution on November 14, 2022.

At the Cabinet meeting held yesterday (Feb.06), a proposal tabled by the Transport & Highways Minister received the approval to expand the project across the country, based on the results of the pilot project and the recommendations provided by the Transport Secretary-chaired committee appointed for the implementation of the project.
