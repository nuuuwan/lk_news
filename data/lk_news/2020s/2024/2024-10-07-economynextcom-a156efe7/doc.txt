Sri Lanka’s China-backed port sees 40-pct rise in RORO moves on quarter

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s China-backed Hambantota International Port said it has seen a 40 percent in roll-on-roll-off vehicle transshipments in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the second.

Vehicles handled rose from 125,526 units in the second quarter to 175,583 units in the September quarter.

“We experienced an increase in the arrival of high and heavy vehicles from our contracted clients, which has significantly contributed to the port’s revenue,” he said in a statement.

“Several RORO shipping lines launching new services to new destinations through HIP, shows their growing confidence in the Port, especially considering the significant increase in the numbers of high end vehicles we transshipments.”

The increase was helped by new shipping lines and new ports joining the network.

Some of the new ports of loading in the portfolio include Shanghai, Ulsan, Taicang, Pyeongtaek, Dafeng and Baltimore.

HIP had already increased yard space, for the expected expansion. (Colombo/Oct07/2024)
