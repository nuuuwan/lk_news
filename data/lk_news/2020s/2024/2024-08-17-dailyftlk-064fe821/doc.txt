Pelwatte Dairy launches landmark initiative with international support

Pelwatte Dairy Industries Ltd., has launched an innovative project titled “Inclusion of women in the formal dairy supply chain for economic empowerment of women farmers.”

This initiative, which commenced in October 2022, aims to empower women farmers, enhance the local dairy industry’s capabilities, and promote sustainable agricultural practices. The project is supported by Solidaridad Asia Network and funded by the Canadian Government, demonstrating a robust international partnership committed to socio-economic development.

The primary goals of this project include empowering women farmers by providing training, technological advancements, and financial support to enhance the productivity and livelihoods of women in the dairy sector, modernising the dairy supply chain by introducing advanced technology, such as a 2,200 litre chilling tank and a QR code-based milk procurement system, to ensure efficient and transparent operations and supporting local dairy development: Promoting fair pricing and sourcing high-quality raw milk, thus fostering a sustainable and robust local dairy industry.

This initiative is unique in its focus on the economic empowerment of women, a traditionally underrepresented group in agriculture. By equipping them with the necessary skills and resources, the project aims to transform the perception of the dairy industry as a predominantly male-dominated field. It also seeks to demonstrate the potential for local dairy production to meet national demand, challenging the preference for imported milk products.

The establishment of a chilling centre with a 2,200 litre capacity ensures a consistent supply of high-quality raw milk. The QR code-based system enhances traceability and transparency, building consumer trust. Training 20 local women farmers to improve dairy farming practices and productivity, contributing to the project’s overarching goal of economic empowerment. Pelwatte Dairy has committed to fair pricing for milk sourced from local farmers and provided material support for animal health, improving milk quality and yield.

Australian High Commission Second Secretary for Development Sophie Gordon has visited the project’s progress site in Hali Ela. This visit marks a significant moment to review and showcase the project’s achievements, highlighting the successful collaboration between international and local organisations.

Pelwatte Dairy’s initiative extends beyond improving the dairy supply chain. It aims to uplift the community by empowering women, thereby contributing to the socio-economic development of rural areas. The integration of modern technology into traditional farming practices not only enhances efficiency but also sets a precedent for sustainable agricultural practices in the region.

Pelwatte Dairy Industries Ltd. Managing Director Akmal Wickramanayake emphasised, “This project underscores our commitment to sustainability, ethical sourcing, and community development. By empowering local women farmers, we are not only enhancing the quality and reliability of our dairy products but also supporting the socio-economic fabric of our communities. We are proud to collaborate with Solidaridad Asia Network and the Canadian Government to bring this vision to life.”
