After wave of airstrikes, Israel says its retaliation against Iran is complete

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that it has completed a series of airstrikes against Iranian military sites, termed “Days of Repentance,” in response to ongoing attacks from Iran, including a significant missile barrage on October 1.

The operation involved dozens of Israeli aircraft, including fighter jets and refuelers, targeting military installations across various regions in Iran, approximately 1,600 kilometers from Israel. These strikes were executed in multiple waves over several hours, focusing on air defense systems and ballistic missile manufacturing sites linked to recent Iranian attacks on Israel.

Meanwhile, Iran says its air defense system successfully countered Israel’s attacks with “limited damage” caused to some locations. In a statement, the Iranian forces stated that Israel attacked military targets in the provinces of Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam.
