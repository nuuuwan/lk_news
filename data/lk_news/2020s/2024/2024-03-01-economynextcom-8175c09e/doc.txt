Sri Lanka to cut Rs200 import tax on dates for Ramazan

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will cut a 200 rupees a kilogram tax on imported dates to one rupee in the next one or two days, State Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

The so-called special commodity levy will be for the Ramazan period, he said in a statement.

Sri Lanka usually cuts or raise import duties without prior warning through mid-night gazette leading to corruption, and also undermining parliamentary control of public finances, critics have said.

The government announced an action plan to reduce corruption and undertook to ‘eliminate or restrict’ tax cuts by minister’s as part of efforts to improve governance.

Dates are an important part of the food of Sri Lanka’s Muslim community who break fast during the Ramazan period.

Dried dates are imported to Sri Lanka from the Middle East to make cake and other sweets also during the rest of the year.

Standard quality dried dates now retail for a little under 1000 rupees a kilogram.
