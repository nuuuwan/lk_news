LG polls expected soon after Presidential Election – Mahinda Deshapriya

Mahinda Deshapriya, Chairman of the National Delimitation Committee for Local Government institutions, hailed the Supreme Court’s decision regarding the postponement of 2023 Local Government Elections as a victory for the people.

Speaking to the media in Anuradhapura, Deshapriya emphasized that delaying the election was wrong, and the court’s acknowledgment of this fact is an important step toward justice.

Furthermore, Deshapriya said he believes that the Local Government Election will be held after the 2024 presidential election.

He also noted, “This decision is not surprising, as the Supreme Court has consistently ruled that postponing or failing to hold elections violates the rights of the people. I see this as justice finally being served, albeit delayed.”

“Accordingly, we believe that the election commission will act to hold this election this year as soon as the presidential election is over”, he added.
