20 office trains cancelled as railway strike continues

At least 20 office trains were cancelled today as well due to the strike launched by Sri Lanka Railway Locomotive Operating Engineers’ Union, says the Railway Department.

Meanwhile, it was reported that over 50 scheduled train journeys were cancelled within yesterday (09) due to the continued strike.

The trade union action launched by the Locomotive Operating Engineers’ Union is continuing for the fourth consecutive day today (10).

They have been on strike since midnight on Thursday, (June 06) over several key demands including solutions to the delays in second-class promotions of locomotive drivers, delays in the recruitment process and several other issues.

It is also mentioned that only locomotive drivers of two of the five running sheds have so far joined the strike and due to this there will be no power set trains operating.

Meanwhile, the Secretary of the union S.R.C.M. Senanayake warned yesterday that if the authorities fail to address their demands, they would be taking steps to intensify their trade union action.
