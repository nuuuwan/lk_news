Parliament to debate OSB today

The Parliament will take up for debate the contentious Online Safety Bill today. The debate is scheduled to continue tomorrow, culminating in a vote on the proposed legislation.

According to sources within the Parliament, several amendments are expected to be incorporated into the bill during its deliberation. Public Security Minister Tiran Alles recently introduced the bill for its initial reading in Parliament. The bill has come under intense fire by Sri Lanka’s opposition parties, civil society groups and activists. The Opposition has claimed the Government was bringing in the legislation to silence critics leading up to the upcoming elections while various groups and organisations have raised concerns about the impact it may have on people’s liberties as well as the effect on the operation of tech companies in Sri Lanka.  Accordingly, a public protest has been organised in the vicinity of the Parliament tomorrow to voice their dissent against the draft bill.

The groups are demanding the Government withdraw the current draft bill and hold discussions with all stakeholders before formulating a new bill.

Nonetheless, Public Security Minister Tiran Alles, has refused to back down from his stance emphasising the imperative need for the legislation due to the alarming surge in abusive online content targeting women and children last year as a compelling reason for the proposed measures.
