GMOA warns of terminal hospital closures if doctor shortage not addressed

Colombo, May 30 (Daily Mirror) - If the responsible parties do not intervene in increasing the approved number of doctors for the hospital system in the country, the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) today warned that they will take a decision on the closure of terminal hospitals that are crippled without doctors.

Addressing the media, its media spokesman, Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe, said that the above decision is for the upcoming Central Committee meeting of the GMOA.

"Due the approved number of doctors for the hospital system not being increased, a serious crisis has been created in the hospital system of the country.

"The approved number of doctors should increase compared to the increase in the population of the country and the expansion of the health system in the past, due to various reasons given by the Management Services Department," he said.

"Even though the President keeps saying that we should train more doctors and provide the needed facilities, a problem has come up. Despite creating new doctors, we can't give them jobs in the country." Dr. Wijesinghe said.

"The most serious point here is that the Management Service Commission, which is causing the delay in making appointments, is an institution under the President.

"A group of 1,390 doctors has to wait more than eight months to get their post-internship appointments after completing their internships. This is an unfortunate situation for these doctors, who could help many hospitals struggling to maintain patient care services. Despite being aware of the daily delays in giving appointments, the responsible parties are not taking action.

"The approved number of doctors in this country has not been updated in six years. Although the government has established new hospitals and treatment units and expanded health services, it has not been possible to assign doctors to them. In some of these new hospitals, even the modern medical equipment have expired.

"Due to the careless and shortsighted actions of the Administrative Services Commission, the country's hospital system is going from bad to worse. This could lead to the complete closure of the hospital system soon.

"The Central Committee of the Government Medical Officers Association has warned that over 400 hospitals and specialist medical units across the country are at risk because of the shortage of doctors. If a solution is not found, these hospitals and units may have to be close as a protest.

"If those responsible do not resolve the current issue, the upcoming Central Committee meeting of the GMOA will have to discuss and decide on the closure of terminal hospitals that are crippled without doctors," he said.
