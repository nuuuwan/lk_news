JVP, LTTE instrumental for economic crisis: S.M. Chandrasena

Colombo, March 22 (Daily Mirror)- The actions of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the LTTE were the main instrumental factors for the current economic crisis, former Minister S.M. Chandrasena said.

He told reporters that if the destruction of property and lives caused by the JVP and the LTTE was evaluated, it would be clear that their actions must have led to the crisis situation the country was facing today.

He said the JVP is now trying to show the country that they are good people by pointing fingers at others for the bankruptcy.
