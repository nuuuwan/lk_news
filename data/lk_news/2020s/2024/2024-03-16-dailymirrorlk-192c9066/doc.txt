Senior CID officers to be transferred over links to underworld drug dealer

The Police Headquarters is reportedly in the process of revamping the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and accordingly, a group of police officers including high-ranking officers within the CID, is set to be transferred over alleged ties with notorious underworld drug dealer Nadun Chinthaka alias ‘Harak Kata’, the Daily Mirror learns.

Nadun Chinthaka and one of his accomplices Salindu Malshika alias “Kudu Salindu,” were arrested in Madagascar on March 01, 2023 in a joint operation by INTERPOL, Malagasy law enforcement authorities, and Customs officials.

They were brought back to the island on March 15 last year and detained by the CID. When ‘Harak Kata’ was detained at the CID, he attempted to escape from the CID, but his attempt was foiled. The Terrorist Investigation Division and the Special Investigation Unit of the Police Headquarters launched an investigation into the incident revealing that several police officers including those attached to the CID had assisted Harak Kata’s escape attempt.

Earlier, it was reported that some officers working in the CID and other departments had received large amounts of gifts in cash and other forms from Harak Kata.

As a result, the Police Headquarters had previously transferred an ASP attached to the CID over the allegations and several other senior officers are also set to be transferred in the next few days over the same allegations. Also, several police officers were arrested and remanded over aiding and abetting Harak Kata to escape from the CID.

Sources said that the Special Investigation Unit is already investigating an SSP and 19 other police officers from the CID over alleged links with Harak Kata.

IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon while serving as the Acting IGP, had previously warned officers about information indicating their links to criminals and said that action would be taken against them based on investigations.

Meanwhile, investigations have been launched into the missing two mobile phones and two passports belonging to Harak Kata and Kudu Salindu, which disappeared while in CID custody.

After the arrest of Harak Kata and Kudu Salindu in Madagascar, when the two were brought to Sri Lanka on March 15, 2023, these two phones and documents were in the custody of two officers of the CID. It was reported that those items have been handed over to the Public Complaints Investigation Division of the CID.

According to police sources, the date on which these two mobile phones and two passports went missing has not been revealed.

It was reported that these phones contained sensitive footage, mobile phone numbers of various drug dealers and organized criminals.

Colombo High Court Judge Damith Thotawatte on Monday ordered that Harak Kata be remanded until 26 April for the latter’s abortive bid to escape from the CID.

‘Harak Kata’ was ordered to be detained at the old prison complex in Tangalle, which is currently being used as a detention centre.

According to police sources, the date on which these two mobile phones and two passports went missing has not been revealed
