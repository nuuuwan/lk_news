Russia’s Voronezh region declares emergency after Ukraine drone attack

A state of emergency was introduced in parts of Russia’s Voronezh region after a Ukrainian drone attack sparked a warehouse fire, the governor of the western region bordering Ukraine said on Sunday.

“There were no casualties,” Alexander Gusev said on the Telegram messaging app, adding that some residents in the Podgorensky district of the region were being evacuated.

Ukraine’s retalliatiatory strike comes in light of Russia launching an overnight drone attack across Ukraine on June 6, hitting an energy facility in the Sumy region in the northeast of the country, officials said.

Hence, Ukrainian mobile drone hunter groups and air defence units shot down 24 of the 27 Russian drones fired on 12 regions, the air force said.

Since March, Russian forces have intensified their bombardments of the Ukrainian power sector.
