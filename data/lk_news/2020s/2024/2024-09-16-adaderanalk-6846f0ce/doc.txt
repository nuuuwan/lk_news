Dilith hits out at ‘absurd’ political dramas by main presidential candidates

The presidential candidate of the ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ alliance, entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera says that an ‘absurd’ form of politics currently exists in the country.

While attending a public rally held in Monaragala today (16), Jayaweera expressed that certain political leaders are providing each other with jokes on the political stage.

Commenting on President Ranil Wickremesinghe, he said the president is asking the people to give him power again, claiming that he has made a ‘change’ which was sought by the people.

“His good friend Anura Kumara is asking him not to call him a ‘friend’ in public. The most powerful agriculture minister in Sri Lankan history, the former agriculture minister Anura Kumara had the greatest number of institutions under his ministry. “

“When the standard of living fell to the bottom in the last two years, did Mr. Anura Kumara bring any protest marches to the Galle Face? Not a single one came,” he said, adding that when a protest march was held it was only a drama enacted to deceive the masses.

“This is the absurd ‘drama politics’ that exists today. These two get on two platforms and joke about each other. In the evening, we watch these jokes,” he charged.
