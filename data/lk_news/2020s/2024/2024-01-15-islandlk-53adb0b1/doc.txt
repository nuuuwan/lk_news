Local fans enjoyed his scene

December 23rd, 2023, was a big night for local music lovers, especially the older generation, when the group All-4-One went into action at the Lotus Tower (open air arena), in Colombo.

Presented by Gold FM, the show also featured the group The Redeemers, and Derrick J (Junkeer), who is now based in Melbourne, Australia.

Known as the legendary King of Romance, Derrick created a romantic impact with his fans, and there were lots of them in the audience, on the night of December 23rd.

Elegantly clad in a light brown suit, Derrick J immediately connected with the audience, the moment he stepped on stage, and his charm and stage presence drew enthusiastic cheers and ecstatic whoops from the crowd.

Engelbert Humperdink’s timeless classic ‘Man Without Love,’ was the opener, and the 72-year-old maestro showcased enduring vocal prowess, throughout his performance, prompting a harmonious sing-along that echoed through the venue.

His melodious journey included ‘There Goes My Everything,’ ‘Last Waltz,’ ‘Release Me,’ ‘Unchained Melody,’ ‘Spanish Eyes’ and a medley seamlessly intertwining the hits ‘Come What May’ and ‘Save The Last Dance’ in Derrick J’s signature style.

The maestro singer/ entertainer skillfully engaged the audience, inviting them to clap along to the infectious rhythm of ‘Love Is In The Air’ and rewarding the loudest clapper with a generous gift of flowers and his complete collection of six CDs and a DVD.

Ardent fans rushed to the stage, presenting bouquets of flowers, and in a gracious gesture, Derrick J expressed gratitude, promising to share the floral joy with other adoring fans upon his return to Australia.

Derrick J had for support four backup singers – the JJ Twins, and two exceptional vocalists from the group Manthraa, Sandasi Methmanthi and Sewmini Sanjana – for a spectacular rendition of Neil Diamond’s ‘Sweet Caroline.’

Derrick J revealed that he had arrived in Sri Lanka three days prior to the concert and had only two hours of rehearsal with the band The Redeemers, and, in fact, had never met the four backup singers, but despite these challenges, he delivered a show that left a multitude of fans in awe.

Who knows, his fans may have the opportunity of seeing their idol doing his own concert, in Colombo, in the near future.

On his return to Australia, Derrick J was involved in a New Year’s Eve celebration, at Cathies Lane Receptions, that drew a crowd of nearly 500 guests.
