Inaugural CPA Australia Appreciation Event

CPA Australia co-hosted an inaugural CPA Australia Appreciation Event for members and key stakeholders on 9 April 2024 at the Australian House.

The event was graced by Australian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Paul Stephens and well attended by more than 200 CPA Australia members and stakeholders, including office bearers of the local professional accounting organisations and senior leaders in businesses and universities.
