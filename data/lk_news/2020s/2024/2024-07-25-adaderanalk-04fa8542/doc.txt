Former Director of Medical Supplies Division granted bail

The Court of Appeal has ordered the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court to release on bail the former Director of the Health Ministry’s Medical Supplies Division, Dr. Kapila Wickramanayake, who was in remand custody over the alleged import of ‘substandard’ human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) vials.

The Court of Appeal had issued the order to the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court to release Dr. Wickramanayake under suitable bail conditions, after considering a writ petition filed by his attorneys.

Wickramanayake was held in remand custody over the alleged substandard immunoglobulin imports case. He had filed the petition through his lawyers, seeking an order that the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court’s decision to remand him to be declared unlawful and therefore, to release him on bail.

On 20 November 2023, four high-ranking officials – MSD Director Dr. Wickramanayake, Assistant Director Devashantha Soloman, Accountant (Supplies) Neran Dhananjaya and the Stock Controller of the Medical Supplies Division Sujith Kumara – were arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID).

The other accused in the case are former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, former Health Secretary Janaka Chandragupta, Additional Health Secretary Dr. Saman Ratnayake and the owner of the company which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of IVIG vials.
