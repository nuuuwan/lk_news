Co-hosts USA beat Canada in T20 World Cup opener

June 2 - Aaron Jones clubbed a brutal unbeaten 94 as T20 World Cup co-hosts USA beat Canada by seven wickets in a pulsating and colourful tournament opener in Texas.

The USA came into the match on the back of a 2-1 series win over Bangladesh and thrashed the Canadians 4-0 when the sides last met in April.

The match was in the balance before Jones - born in Queens, New York to Barbadian parents – swung the match the way of the home side with a stellar knock off 40 balls as they chased down Canada’s 194-5.

Jones targeted the short boundaries on this former baseball ground, previously home to the Texas Air Hogs, launching a majestic 10 sixes into the night sky and whipping the jubilant fans into a frenzy.

With the US requiring 36 off 35 balls Jones sliced the ball to short third, but Nikhil Dutta clumsily spilled a simple catch.

It proved decisive as the 29-year-old pummelled the US to victory with 14 balls to spare after support from Andries Gous, who hit 65 off 46 balls.

Aaron Johnson (23) had earlier set the tone for Canada’s total when he struck the first ball of the game for four, as he and Navneet Dhaliwal (61) got Canada off to a flying start.

Nicholas Kirton's 51 off 31 balls and some late hitting from wicketkeeper Shreyas Movva, who finished unbeaten on 32, boosted the total.
