Hyde Park, Panchikawatte Are Starting Points for SJB’s Big Colombo Protest

COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lanka's main opposition party, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), is gearing up for a significant protest in Colombo today (30).

The party aims to pressure the government into addressing pressing issues faced by the Sri Lankan people.

SJB General Secretary and Member of Parliament, Ranjith Madduma Bandara, announced that the protest will commence at 1:30 pm from two separate locations: Hyde Park and Panchikawatta in Colombo.

The two groups are expected to converge at a prominent location in the city, though the exact destination remains to be confirmed.

In a significant development, the Colombo No. 04 Magistrate L. Manjula issued a court order today prohibiting opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, Samagi Jana Balawegaya general secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara, and others from hindering traffic on several streets in the Maligawatta police jurisdiction.

The court order specifically bans blocking activities on Sangharaja Mawatha via Pradeepa Mawatha, Saddharma Mawatha, Jayantha Virasekara Mawatha, Milton Perera Mawatha, and Jumma Junction from the Maligawatte Muslim Burial Grounds.
