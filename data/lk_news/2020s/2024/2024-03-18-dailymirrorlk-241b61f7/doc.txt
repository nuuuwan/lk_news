Paediatrician warns of risks from matching environment-body temperatures

Colombo, March 18 (Daily Mirror) - If the environmental temperature reaches body temperature, it can cause an increase in palpitations and decrease oxygen supply to the brain, thus leading to heat shocks, fainting and potential death, Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) Consultant Paediatrician Dr. Deepal Perera said.

He said the normal body temperature of a person is 37.5°C (98.6°F). When the environmental temperature reaches 37°C, equivalent to human body temperature, increased sweating occurs, resulting in the loss of more water and minerals from the body through perspiration and hence certain complexities can occur.

Therefore, we should drink more water and drink more natural beverages to keep the body temperature in balance, and children should not be allowed to play during the day with a high temperature.

They also requested that people to drink natural beverages, adding some salt to maintain the sodium level in their bodies.

Due to the prevailing high temperature, special attention should be paid to the children as well as the elderly.
