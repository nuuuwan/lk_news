Joint working committee with Russia proposed to deal with Sri Lanka mercenaries

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has proposed a joint working committee with Russian officials to deal with hundreds of ex-soldiers deployed in the Russia’s war with Ukraine, the island’s embassy in Moscow said.

Returnees and families of the ex-soldiers have complained that they were misled into going to Russia as camp helpers and then they were forced to fight in the frontlines.

“Sri Lanka proposed to establish a joint working committee comprising of officials from the two sides to meet regularly to address issues and concerns of the Sri Lankans who have been deployed,” the embassy in Moscow said.

State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya visited the Russian Federation on June 26-27 and met Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Andrey Rudenko and the Deputy Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation Colonel General A V Fomin.

“Discussions with Deputy Minister of Defence of Russia Col Gen Alexander Fomin to address issues affecting Sri Lanka nationals deployed in the Russia military including compensation for the deceased & injured, regularising remuneration, voluntary return & early contract termination,” Balasuriya said on X (twitter).

A joint working committee comprising officials from the two sides was proposed, to meet regularly to address issues. Both sides agreed to continue engagements.

The delegation included Members of Parliament Dayasiri Jayasekera and Gamini Waleboda, Secretary of the Ministry of Defense General G D H Kamal Gunaratne, Charge d’Affaires of Sri Lanka to the Russian

Federation Ambassador P M Amza, Additional Solicitor General Harippriya Jayasundara, Director General, Consular Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sisira Senavirathne, and former Ambassador Dr Saman Weerasinghe.

The Criminal Investigative Department (CID) has said that 17 Sri Lankans who went to Russia have been killed, and escapees from the warfront say that over 200 ex-military personnel of Sri Lankan origin have died fighting for the Russia Ukraine war.

Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry said that Russia and Sri Lanka had agreed that no more ex-military personnel from the island would be recruited for the Russian-Ukraine war.

Past and present personnel are now required to get Defense Ministry clearance before visiting Russia.

Several Sri Lankans are said to have been recruited under promises of high-salaries and Russian citizenship. (Colombo/June28/2024)
