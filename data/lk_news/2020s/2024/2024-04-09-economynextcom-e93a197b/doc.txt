Sri Lanka to hike election deposits paid by candidates

ECONOMYNEXT â€” As Sri Lanka heads into decisive elections, the cabinet of ministers has approved a proposal to increase the deposit placed by candidates representing recognised political parties as well as independent candidates.

The deposit placed by a candidate representing a party has been increased to 2.6 million rupees while an independent party at the presidential election has to pay to 3.1 million.

The proposal was made jointly by President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe.

For parliamentary elections, a candidate representing a recognised political party must pay 11,000 rupees while an independent candidate has to make a deposit of 16,000 rupees.

At the local government polls, a party candidate must pay 6,000 rupees as deposit, while an independent candidate has to pay 11,000.

Sri Lanka is still recovering from its worst financial crisis in decades, and the local government elections that were due to be held in 2023 were postponed citing a lack of funds.

The presidential election is due to be held between September 17 and October 18 this year, after which a parliamentary election is anticipated, either at the end of this year or in early 2025. (Colombo/Apr09/2024)
