President Wickremesinghe made this announcement during a progress review meeting of the Agriculture Modernization Program held at the Presidential Secretariat on Wednesday morning (03).

He emphasized that establishment of this new council aims to enhance the efficiency of government institutions involved in the agricultural modernization initiative.

At the meeting, Senior Prof. Gamini Senanayake, Chairman of the expert committee, presented the policy framework devised for the modernization of the agriculture sector in Sri Lanka to the President.

Funds have already been allocated to kick-start these pilot projects, indicating a proactive approach towards achieving tangible results.

President Wickremesinghe emphasized the necessity of transitioning from subsistence agriculture towards a more modernized approach that encompasses both large-scale and small-scale operations. He underlined the pivotal role of the agricultural export sector in the national economy, highlighting the urgent need for the rapid transformation of agriculture to align with the broader economic development agenda of the country.

During the deliberations, significant emphasis was placed on advancing and refining various facets of agriculture, encompassing paddy cultivation, other agricultural crops, as well as dairy production and animal husbandry. The participants explored avenues to modernize these sectors, aiming to enhance their efficiency, productivity, and sustainability.

Moreover, discussions revolved around the allocation of 500,000 acres of new land for cultivation, indicating a concerted effort to expand agricultural activities in Sri Lanka and address emerging agricultural challenges.

In addition to modernizing agricultural practices, discussions also centred on the importance of value addition to agricultural products and the exploration of export opportunities.
