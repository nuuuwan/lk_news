Issues of co-ordination during the 1971 insurgency

(Excerpted from the autobiography of MDD Peiris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

A major responsibility I took upon myself during this period (of the 1971 insurrecton) was to co-ordinate essential services such as food distribution; the movement of petroleum products; electricity, water; and transport. I, of course, had enough experience of handling food distribution. Some of the same principles and part of the same drill could be applied to some of the other sectors.

In a way food was the most important. Long curfew hours not only restricted food movements, but also gave very little time for the mass of the population to buy their essentials such as rice, flour and sugar from their co-operative, or authorized dealer point. During the few hours available for shopping, there were large and somewhat restive crowds at cooperative stores in particular. It was clear that if food was not available at these points or the service was not efficient, there would be panic.

The many thousands of these points particularly the ones in Colombo and some of the major cities had to be regularly stocked. This was to a great extent solved after much negotiations by arranging for curfew passes for lorries. The next problem was the quick clearance of the queues at the co-operatives. If this was not done quickly enough there would be panic and even rioting. The last thing the country could afford were food riots.

Since the great majority of the people came for small quantities at a time of food items such as flour, sugar dhal etc, very often in portions of a quarter pound or half pound, it was essential that such commodities were pre-weighed, packeted and kept ready for instant sale. In the conditions that prevailed, slow weighing and distribution after the stores had opened for a few hours before the re- imposition of the curfew, would have led to general unrest. Such unrest would have complicated the security situation immensely.

Here again the public service rose to the occasion. More specifically, wives of public servants. Many of them were organized into voluntary groups, and they helped the store employees to weigh and packet essential food commodities, often working through the night. A serious crisis was thus averted. Much of the experience I gained from the operation was put to very good use later during the troubled times in 1983, when I found myself as Secretary to the Ministry of Food and Co-operatives.

One evening at about 8 p.m. I walked to the main building of Temple Trees, from the administrative block in order to see the Prime Minister. When I reached the verandah I was surprised to see a familiar figure pacing up and down. It was Mr. JR Jayewardene. I did not know why he had come, so I went up and spoke to him. He was both distressed and angry. I was quite surprised to learn that his son had been taken in under the emergency regulations.

He wanted to see the Prime Minister immediately. She was at a meeting inside, but when she was informed of the development, she came out and met Mr. Jayewardene. The Prime Minister listened patiently to an angry father. It was decided that his son would be released on a personal guarantee given by him. I had many things to do, and to this day I do not know why Mr. Jayewardena’s son was taken in.

For over a month since the beginning of the insurrection, life was hectic. I worked from Temple Trees. I hardly went to the Senate office. I insisted that normal and routine correspondence be attended to. The curfews, the disruptions and the tensions were not to be made an excuse. These were the instructions given to the Secretaries of the Ministries and Heads of Departments as well. The restoration of public confidence was important. The machinery of government had to be seen to be functioning normally, even whilst under extraordinary strain.

This was also a period of many stories and rumours, some of them quite dramatic, or perhaps more accurately, melodramatic. The most effective antidote to this was the visible and manifest functioning of government, in matters small and big; in routine functioning as well as in the efficient delivery of essential services. The public service worked under great strain during this time.

Out in the districts, the Government Agents had to provide leadership in a much less secure environment than in Colombo, to solve a multiplicity of problems. These included not only maintaining essential supplies and services vital to the life of the community, but also the co-ordination of the civilian and military aspects of the restoration and maintenance of security.

Secretaries and heads of departments had to constantly monitor matters relating to their areas of responsibility, and liase with the Government Agents and their area field officers. The Secretary to the Prime Minister, who in any case, was in an apex situation, had, when relevant, in consultation with the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and singly most of the time to address a large number of issues that came pouring in from the rest of the public service.

Most of the matters that came up concerned problems faced by various public agencies, which required an early, if not an immediate response. Some questions were extraordinary, and manifested a state of paranoia. For instance, the question as to whether one should not blow up or otherwise seriously disable a major bridge, so as to isolate Colombo and so better protect it!

All this meant over a month of going home, in most instances well past 2 a.m. to be back in harness by about 8.30 a.m. the same day. In the hours in between, on many a day, there were telephone calls at home. Physiologically, I had crossed the border from a feeling of sleepiness, to sleeplessness, or inability to sleep.

Going home at those early morning hours was also a nerve wracking experience. I had to cross the Bambalapitiya/Wellawatte bridge over the canal on Galle Road, near the Savoy cinema. The whole area was in pitch darkness because the security forces guarding the bridge had switched off all the road lights. They had also placed some old double decker buses right across the bridge at some points, so that any vehicle crossing the bridge had to navigate in the pitch dark along a narrow and meandering path, using only the lights of the vehicle.

Lurking in the shadows were armed personnel with automatic weapons, and one never knew how much sleep or rest they have had, and in what condition their nerves were. Approaching the bridge was an eerie experience. Confronted with this major hazard on my route home, I managed to get a police car for the journey. The police also very kindly arranged for a police sergeant to accompany me. They did not trust a mere police driver.

The reason for this added precaution was perhaps the rumours circulating at the time, that the JVP would come in various disguises, including in hijacked police cars. The sergeant seemed to be a hardened veteran. He had fundamentally uncomplicated views about what to do to the JVP. He said that they were like a “cancer,” and had therefore to be “completely eradicated.”

We were already thinking of an appeal by the Prime Minister to the youth to lay down their arms, as well as various schemes of rehabilitation, leading on to employment. I was naturally not prepared to share these views with a fundamentalist police sergeant, into whose hands I had temporarily entrusted my life!

In recording momentous events, one is always faced with the problem of selection. Thereafter, the problem arises as to how much of the selected areas one should dwell on. There are areas which could be of special interest or significance to smaller numbers, the narration and analysis of which would call for separate monographs or booklets. For instance an extended analysis of the immense effort of co-ordinating so many disparate areas of vital activity; the role of institutions and personalities; and achievements and mistakes, could be of great interest to the practicing public servant.

It would be in a way a unique series of case studies. There are many such areas. Unfortunately, however, there is no place for such detailed work, in a general memoir. Therefore, I will leave the subject of the insurgency of 1971, with only one other observation. This pertains to the manner in which the Prime Minister, Mrs. Bandaranaike functioned during this tense and testing period.

To the Prime Minister too, the insurgency came as a shock. There was no precedent of such an outbreak within living memory or even beyond. This wave washed over a government which had come into office with an unprecedented two-thirds majority. a government which contained within its fold the two major established left parties of the country.

As far as the traditional left parties were concerned, revolutionary rhetoric had been subsumed in a process of evolution in the intricacies of constitutional government. Left leaders like Dr. N.M. Perera. and Dr. Colvin R.de Silva, were widely known and acknowledged to be authorities on parliamentary practice, and experts on the interpretation of Erskine May the “Bible” of Parliamentary procedure. It was widely stated that they would have made excellent Ministers in a British Labour government.

It was in this intellectual climate that the JVP shock was administered. Did it presage the rise of a new, militant. revolutionary left? Or was it an untidy bundle of rural disparities, caste oppression, the frustration of unemployment, and naive idealism emerging in a fascist garb’? It was the latter theory that the traditional left subscribed to. As far as they were concerned, they constituted the left. The JVP could not be anything other than a fascist aberration.

But whatever the theories, the country was now faced with an episode of hard reality, the real and deadly practice of, if not revolution, an insurrection. It fell to the Prime Minister, both as Prime Minister and Minister of Defence to orchestrate a practical response to this very real peril.

In this moment of unprecedented and grave danger, the Prime Minister was calm., collected, indefatigable and totally focussed. She was an oasis of calm in an arid desert of rumour and panic. The despondency and fear in the faces of most of the Ministers were visible and to a significant extent contagious. After some time. the Prime Minister had to virtually order them out of Temple Trees, with the remark that if they were wanted, they would be sent for. I remember her telling some of them, “you are spreading panic here.

The Prime Minister worked closely with the operations room and the Defence authorities. Sometimes she spent time in the operations room. listening to the radio messages and the telephone calls. That way, she received first hand information about the evolving situation. The Trade Unions were mobilized, and she spent important time with their leaders. There were also various civic groups who were helping out in various ways and she found time to see some of them. The main party in opposition, the United National Party lent its support to the government during this moment of great national peril. There were meetings of the Security Council morning and evening. Most of the meetings went on for long. I myself did not attend these meetings. It was not necessary for operational purposes that the Secretary to the Prime Minister should attend these meetings. In any case, I was far too busy co-ordinating a very large area of civilian activity to afford the time to spend hours at Security Council meetings.

If there was any important policy issue arising from these meetings, the Prime Minister in many instances discussed matters with me. What I marveled most about. was the ability of the Prime Minister to keep going hour after hour. never looking tired, or as far as I was aware, never losing concentration. She was clearly in charge; clearly in control; and in fact solely in charge. She listened carefully, and decided quickly. There were no committees.

When the Cabinet met, the Ministers were briefed by the Prime Minister, strictly on a need to know basis. She was not prepared to reveal to the Cabinet or anyone else sensitive plans and operational details. She was the dominating and decisive influence, and it was a common saying that the Prime Minister was “the only man in the Cabinet.” I was to realize during this period that all these qualities and attributes were grounded on a deeper philosophical base.

In the early days of the insurgency. when the government had not yet gained substantial control over the situation, and when the Prime Minister’s own life was in danger, for one was not sure at the time of the degree of infiltration of the armed services and the police, and whether some guard armed with an automatic weapon at Temple Trees was one of the JVP cadres. the Prime Minister calmly contemplated her own death. She was composed and reflective. She told me that one had to face calmly whatever comes. She said that she had a heavy duty to perform, and that one had to perform one’s duty irrespective of consequences.

“Even if they kill me.” she said, “I want in my mind to be clear that I had done my duty to the best of my ability. I know my religion!” This was not a public statement she made. It was something that came out of her spontaneously in a grave and reflective moment. She was more deeply immersed in Buddhism than most people knew. I became aware that she spent some time in the shrine room unfailingly every morning.
