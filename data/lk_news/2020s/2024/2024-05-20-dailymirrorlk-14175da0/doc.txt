"This is a time for deep contemplation on Buddha's timeless teachings," Kananathan said. "Celebrating 25 years of UN recognition, Vesak Day serves as a reminder of the principles of love, compassion, and non-violence. It calls for reflection on our actions and inspires efforts toward social justice, environmental protection, and the alleviation of suffering." Kananathan urged attendees to dedicate themselves to creating a world guided by wisdom, empathy, and respect for all beings, embracing Buddha's qualities of love, compassion, joy, and calmness.
