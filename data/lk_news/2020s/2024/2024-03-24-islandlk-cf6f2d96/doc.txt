It said: Ex-Pack took this opportunity to express its gratitude and support towards its female employees, acknowledging their indispensable contributions to the company and industry that has been traditionally dominated by male.

Empowering women is not just a moral and ethical imperative but a strategic one, believes the management of Ex-Pack.
