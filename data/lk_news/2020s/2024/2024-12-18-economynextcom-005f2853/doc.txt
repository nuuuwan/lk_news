Sri Lanka stocks close up despite early profit taking

ECONOMYNEXT – The Colombo Stock Exchange ended firmer on Wednesday, after a drop in the early trade, data on its site showed.

The broader ASPI closed up 0.67 percent, or 97.84 points, at 14,614.30; while the more liquid S&P SL20 Index closed up 0.45 percent, or 19.56 points, at 4,404.13.

“There was profit taking early in the trade, but we saw buyers came in after that. With the fixed income returns are on the decline, investors are now buying stocks,” a stock broker said.

There was a continued rallying in banking stocks, they said.

Hatton National Bank closed 1.3 percent up at 275.50, and DFCC Bank closed 0.3 percent firmer at 91.30.

“Banking shares are gaining because investors see no impact from the sovereign debt restructuring.”
