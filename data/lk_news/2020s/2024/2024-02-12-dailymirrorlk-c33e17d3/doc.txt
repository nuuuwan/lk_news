Colombo, Feb 12 (Daily Mirror) - In the wake of the rising temperatures, medical experts have advised parents to make sure their children take a bath for at least twenty minutes per day in order to keep dehydration at bay.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Pediatric Specialist Dr. Deepal Perera highlighted the growing prevalence of skin ailments among children, attributing the trend to the escalating heat levels across the country.
