Tribute to Late Anthony A. Page

I first met Anthony A. Page, fondly known as Baba, in early 1992 while conducting an audit of the Ceylon Theatres Group. At the time, I was working as an article clerk at KPMG Ford Rhodes Thornton & Company. During our initial meeting, where he interviewed me for a position within his Group, I was struck by his gentle and humble demeanour. Our conversation revolved around the importance of family, and he shared the story of his father, late Albert Page, who came from Manipay, Jaffna to Colombo, eventually succeeding in business. Little did I realise that this conversation will lay the foundation for a lasting professional and personal relationship.

In the ensuing years, I had the privilege of working closely with Page. Over time, our professional relationship deepened, and I came to admire his financial acumen. His mastery of financial accounting and analysis was extraordinary—he had a unique ability to see through the intricacies of finance, a talent unmatched by anyone I have encountered.

Many individuals sought Page’s advice, both for business and personal matters. His generosity with his time and knowledge was remarkable, as he would often engage me in discussions about finance. He was always willing to teach, giving private lessons in accounting and finance to those who asked for help, including the children of his friends and family. When children shared their exam results with him, he would respond warmly, encouraging them with a simple, “Well done, son.” He was very happy and in tears when he told me that his son, Aravinda, had been selected to study medicine at Cambridge University.

Page valued peace above all, especially within his family. His deep commitment to maintaining harmony among his loved ones made him a pillar of strength for those around him. He was well-regarded by many as the most compassionate member of the Page family, a true gentleman in every sense and a quintessential diplomat.

During my time at Lanka Walltiles Group, where Page was my chairman for over a decade, I witnessed first-hand his compassionate leadership. He opened doors to interact with many corporate leaders. He always showed concern for the well-being of employees, often inquiring about their family, health and happiness. His belief that the true purpose of corporate responsibility was to enhance the quality of life for people left a lasting impact on everyone.

Throughout his tenure as chairman, Page worked with more than 30 directors within the Group. His ability to bring out the best in people was appreciated by those who worked with him. Even during challenging times, he remained steadfast in his values, despite occasional disagreements over business strategies. As years passed by I started to realise how much he found solace in his wife and both his children, especially his daughter Anjalie. I noticed many a time him telling Anjalie over the phone ‘I shall do as you say’.

One of Page’s most remarkable traits was his humility. Despite his financial success, he always considered himself poorer than he truly was. He frequently reminded of the importance of saving and investing for the future. To my knowledge, he never profited personally from the business deals he facilitated for friends, often instructing them to donate to charity in lieu of payment. His philosophy, which he termed “WAFF” (What are friends for), exemplified his generosity and selflessness.

Personally, Page felt like a second father to me. His fatherly wisdom extended beyond finance and business. I wouldn’t have reached this level of success without his guidance. One piece of advice that has remained etched in my mind is his counsel on family: “Have time for your children when they have time for you, otherwise when you have time for them, they will not have time for you.”

Page was a corporate icon, a man who navigated boardroom politics with grace and wisdom. His concern for others, especially minority shareholders, and his remarkable ability to foster peace and harmony are traits that will forever influence me. His passion for his work, whether drafting financial schedules using Lotus and Microsoft Word (he particularly disliked Microsoft Excel) or offering guidance to those around him, was unparalleled. His legacy, both in business and in life, will endure in the hearts and minds of all those who had the privilege to know him.
