Shanaka dropped, Chamika included

Colombo, Feb. 6 (Daily Mirror) - The Sri Lanka Cricket Selection Committee has selected a 16-member squad for the upcoming three-match One Day International (ODI) series against Afghanistan.

Former captain Dasun Shanaka has been excluded from the squad, likely to be rested for the series, reliable sources told Daily Mirror.

All-rounder Chamika Karunaratne, who missed the recent Zimbabwe series, has been included in the squad, enhancing both the batting and bowling line-up.

Except for Dasun's exclusion and Chamika's return, there won't be many major changes in the ODI squad against Afghanistan compared to the squad named for the Zimbabwe series.

The ODI series is scheduled to commence on February 9th in Pallekele.

Shanaka, who has struggled with form for nearly a year, was stripped of the captaincy after the ODI World Cup, where Sri Lanka failed to finish in the top eight, missing out on the Champions Trophy 2025.

Shanaka's poor performance with the bat, particularly in ODIs, led to his exclusion. He was included in the last ODI series against Zimbabwe but was dropped for the third ODI due to his inability to return to form.

Karunaratne has been selected to fill Shanaka's absence. He previously replaced Captain Dasun Shanaka in Sri Lanka's World Cup squad last year.

Leg-spinner Jeffrey Vandersay, who was added to the recently concluded Zimbabwe ODI squad, will

miss the Afghanistan series due to a finger injury. Wanindu Hasaranga is expected to replace him in the playing XI.

Sri Lanka Cricket has sent the ODI squad for Sports Minister Harin Fernando for the approval.

Meanwhile, the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) has announced their 15-member squad for the series. Their premier spinner, Rashid Khan, remains unavailable due to ongoing recovery from back surgery. Young leg-spinner Qais Ahmad has been included to fill the gap.

The series promises exciting encounters between two talented cricket nations, with Sri Lanka aiming to build on their recent ODI form while Afghanistan seeks to cause an upset without their star spinner, Khan.
