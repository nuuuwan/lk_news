Global political tensions and Small States’ survival

The issue of the survival of Small States in the current world political and economic order is receiving considerable international attention and very rightly so. The issues in this connection are of such a magnitude that observers cannot be faulted for predicting an increasingly bleak future for the global South. In fact, the latter hemisphere may need to struggle grimly to survive in the midst of currently growing inter-state tensions.

Economics drives politics and the veracity of this statement is continuously borne in international politics as well as in the domestic politics of the majority of countries. For example, if job quota-linked problems are plunging Bangladesh into murderous political violence today it is mainly on account of the negative economic fallout from the issues in question on some sections of the Bangladeshi populace.

Likewise, the voting to power of a ‘centre-Left’ government in Britain, following more than a decade of Conservative rule, was prompted principally by the material hardships the majority of Britons were forced to bear under Conservative governance. It is a question of the ‘iron laws’ of economics proving decisive in politics.

In the area of South Asian inter-state politics, or ‘geopolitics’ , as some would misleadingly and loosely prefer to term it, if India has emerged as a world ‘Swing State’ today of pervasive influence, it is mainly on account of India’s phenomenal economic clout. Once again, economics drives politics.

On another front, the fact that Australia is today championing the cause of Small States and developing countries testifies to its growing influence as a ‘Miniature Superpower’ in world politics. Some clarity is needed on what is prompting Australia to be a member of the Quad grouping but it is plain to see, given its increasing clout in a number of areas, that Australia is a fast-growing major power in its own right.

Australia being a power to watch closely, it would be interesting to ascertain as to what it could do for Small States to enable the latter to improve their lot in the current world order. Former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is on record that his country would be supporting ‘smaller and developing countries in navigating geopolitical pressures’, and such support is badly needed by the poorest of the poor of the South.

What concrete forms such support would take emerges as a matter of the first importance for the developing world. However, such support would be hugely welcomed by the more perceptive sections of the South, considering the pragmatic bent in Australia’s current foreign policy. In fact, it could be argued that Australia’s foreign policy is broadly Non-aligned and this could be of great interest to the majority of developing countries who are nominally at least, Non-aligned.

Thus, Australian initiatives in the direction of assistance to and cooperation with the South could prove most timely and relevant. Considering the foregoing comments on the importance of economic forces, it was particularly revealing that former Prime Minister Morrison highlighted the centrality of economic conditions in the shaping of the current ‘global political landscape’ as opposed to ‘shifts in ideology.’

For the most hapless of developing countries, political ideology could be of little or no importance currently. Small Sri Lanka which is in a league with the most debt-ridden of African countries, proves the point. Given its economic helplessness, it has no choice but to be open to financial support from wherever such help would come. In fact, it could be said that it is only at present that Non-alignment has come to its own in states such as Sri Lanka. This is because economic necessity compels Sri Lanka to relate to the rest of the world amicably minus ideological blinkers.

In a connected development, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is on record as calling for an urgent reform of the international financial system, considering that it is ‘outdated, dysfunctional and unfair.’ This is certainly so from the viewpoint of developing countries and the issues facing the latter are compounded by the fact that they could do nothing, given their utter helplessness, to reform the existing global political and economic order in their favour.

The current runaway violence in the Gaza bears out the point, for instance. Given their commonality of condition with the suffering sections of the Middle East, the South is collectively obliged to take up the cause of these grievously affected sections with the international community, and this includes the ordinary people of Israel who are victims of terror as well. But their economic and political impotence prevents the South from initiating any remedial action in this regard.

For instance, what constructive action could the South take to see an end to the power struggles among the foremost powers within the UN Security Council, which are getting in the way of the UN resolving the Middle East tangle politically and fairly?

The answer is none because the South cannot currently exercise any substantive collective power to change existing power relations within the international system. For, it is such collective power that could enable it to work towards the legitimate interests of its members. In fact, it lacks the collective organizations that could empower it to work towards the initiation of such positive changes. The dysfunctional nature of NAM, for example, proves the point.

However, the South cannot afford to be passive and impotent any longer. NAM, for example, would need to bounce back into contention. Now that budding superpowers, such as Australia, are willing to take up its cause, the South should enlist their support and that of other Swing States to change global power relations in its favour.

The need for such action by the South is increasingly underscored by the growingly divisive nature of international politics. The indications are that the East-West polarity, for instance, is widening. One proof that this is so comes from the Middle East itself. At the time of writing some 14 Palestinian organizations have committed to work together to further the Palestinian cause.

This is a positive development but the formalization of the union is rendered controversial by the fact that it was effected in Beijing, under the auspices of the Chinese government. This amounts to dragging the Middle East tangle further into fractious East-West power relations, rendering the problem more difficult to resolve. After all, the Israeli side is firmly backed by the US and its allies and this alliance is bound to continue indefinitely.

Accordingly, the South needs to get its act together without further delay. It needs to muster all the international support it could avail of to prove a formidable, independent force in world politics.
