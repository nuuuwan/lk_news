232 vendors to be charged for selling bread below standard weight

The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) has decided to press charges against a total of 232 bakery and shop owners who sold loaves of bread with below-par weight and failed to display the prices.

On February 02, the CAA published an Extraordinary Gazette stipulating a standard weight for a loaf of bread,

Accordingly, the standard weight of a loaf of bread was set as 450g with an allowed deficiency of 13.5g while a standard weight of 225g with a 9g deficiency was stipulated for half a loaf of bread.

The gazette mentioned noted that any type of bread manufactured, packed, stored, offered for sale, displayed for sale or sold retail or wholesale should contain the standard weight specified in the gazette extraordinary.

Further, all traders have been ordered to display the weight of bread displayed for sale.

After the gazette was published, the CAA launched island-wide raids in search of the vendors who fail to comply with the gazette notification.
