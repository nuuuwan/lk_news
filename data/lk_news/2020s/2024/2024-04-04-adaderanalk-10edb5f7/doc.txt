Weerasena Gamage tipped to fill Nandasena’s vacant MP seat

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna’s Weerasena Gamage is expected to fill the parliamentary seat left vacant following the passing of Anuradhapura District SLPP MP H. Nandasena this morning (04).

SLPP Parliamentarian Nandasena had passed away due to a sudden illness this morning at the age of 69, family members confirmed to Ada Derana.

He was a former member of Padaviya Pradeshiya Sabha and North Central Provincial Council where he held a provincial ministerial portfolio.

He was dismissed from his ministerial position in May 2017 after attending a Joint Opposition May Day rally.

He contested the 2020 parliamentary election as a candidate of the Sri Lanka People’s Freedom Alliance in Anuradhapura District and was elected to the Parliament of Sri Lanka.

Weerasena is reportedly next in line on the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) list for the Anuradhapura District.

Weerasena Gamage had secured a total of 38,242 votes after contesting the 2020 Parliamentary Elections from the Anuradhapura District and managed to place 9th in the preferential votes list.

Against this backdrop, the Acting Secretary General of Parliament has informed the Election Commission, in writing, that a seat in the Ninth Parliament has become vacant following the demise of MP Nandasena.

This notification was made in terms of Section 64(1) of the Parliamentary Elections Act, No. 1 of 1981.
