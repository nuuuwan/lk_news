TPA led by Mano Ganesan to support Sajith

Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) led by MP Mano Ganesan has extended their support to Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa’s candidacy at the upcoming Presidential Election.

Adressing a press conference yesterday, Ganesan announced that all parties to the alliance, including the Democratic People’s Front (DPF), National Union of Workers (NUW) and the Up-Country People’s Front (UCPF) representing Sri Lanka’s Malaiyaha Tamil community have agreed to support Premadasa.

“The politburo of the TPA have decided to extend our fullest support to the Samagi Jana Sandhanaya leader Sajith Premadasa. We have come to an agreement with the Samagi Jana Sandhanaya. We are not asking for the moon nor stars. We are only asking for better lives as Sri Lankan citizens for the 800,000 people living in the estates,” he said.

Also addressing the press conference, TPA Deputy Leader Palani Digambaram said Premadasa is the only honest leader in the country.

“We believe he will take care of our people just as a father would,” Digambaram said. “We also believe in the people. Sajith Premadasa will be elected as the President of Sri Lanka on 21 September,” he added.

Party leaders highlighted the numerous issues affecting the country’s hill country and estates, emphasising the need for estate workers to become small estate owners and for their housing and land issues to be resolved. The group said that Sajith Premadasa has agreed to address the problems faced by the Malaiyaha Tamil community and is committed to serving the people.
