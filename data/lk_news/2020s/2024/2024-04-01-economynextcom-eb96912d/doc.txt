Sri Lanka producers meeting demand, egg at Rs35 for new year: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Local egg production has exceeded the total daily requirement, Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries Mahinda Amaraweera has said.

“Therefore, the price of a local egg is likely to come down to 35 rupees in the coming period,” Amaraweera was quoted in a statement by the Government Information Department.

On average, the daily requirement of eggs in this country is 6.5 million eggs. According to the Egg Producers Association, the production of eggs in local poultry farms has already exceeded 7.5 million, Amaraweera said.

Although the number of mother animals needed annually in this country is 85,000, the number of mother animals in all poultry farms has exceeded 135,000. All poultry farms have completed 100 percent chick capacity, according to the statement.

At present, the price of an egg in the local market varies between 42-48 rupees.

Last year, Sri Lanka’s egg production was heavily affected by price controls imposed by the Consumer Affairs Authority, as chicken feed prices went up amid local forex shortage and a global commodity bubble. The government had also imposed restrictions on maize imports which poultry farmers use for chicken feed.

Following the price controls on eggs imposed last year, and ensuing shortages in the market, Sri Lanka had to import eggs from India.

Sri Lanka’s eggs were around 20 to 25 rupees before the rupee collapsed in April last year from 200 to 360 to the US dollar. Sri Lanka’s chicken meat and egg prices are generally higher than the world due to import licensing on maize which has pushed up production costs. (Colombo/Apr1/2024)
