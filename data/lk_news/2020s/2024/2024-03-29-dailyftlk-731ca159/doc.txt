Sri Lanka’s biggest marketing event of the year, SLIM Dialog Brand Week 2024 concluded in style recently, amidst active participation from across industries, with all sessions being sold out.

The 3-day symposium, held from 13 to 15 March at Waters Edge, SLIM Dialog Brand Week 2024 was no doubt the most anticipated marketing event in Sri Lanka’s marketing calendar. This flagship event, organised by the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) in collaboration with Dialog Axiata, surpassed all expectations, solidifying its reputation as the preeminent gathering of marketing minds in the country.

Project Chair Kevin Almeida said: “We are very pleased with the outcome of this year’s event, and we extend our gratitude to both those who attended the event, and our panels of experts who made it all possible. A special thanks to Dialog Axiata our title partner and all other financial and non-financial sponsors for supporting us in this endeavour. This year’s event was articulated around exploring solution-driven branding strategies tailored to Sri Lanka’s unique context. We set out to deliver insights on emerging digital trends, innovative marketing, branding and business strategies shaping the future of Sri Lankan corporate brands to exploit the domestic market while exploring global avenues. However, I believe we have achieved more than that, by connecting people and bringing the fraternity together, helping to create new partnerships that will bear fruit in the future! Having understood this year is a stepping-stone for the upcoming year, we at SLIM are looking forward to reach unprecedented levels next year.”

This year, all the sessions were carried out physically to entice maximum engagement, and followed by networking opportunities full of fun and entertainment. My gratitude goes to the distinguished speakers of all three days, our title sponsor Dialog Axiata and other valued sponsors/partners, the Project Chair and his committee for raising the bar of this event, and making it one of the most sought-after marketing events in the country.”
