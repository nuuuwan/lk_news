Sri Lanka to get 22 hardly used locomotives from India

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka Railways will receive 22 ALCO diesel engines from India as a grant, Health and Media Minister Nalinda Jayatissa said.

“India will gift 20 slightly used M10 locomotive engines and 2 additional engines for obtaining spare parts for them,” Cabinet spokesman Jayatissa said.

RITES, formerly known as Rail India Technical and Economic Service Engineering Service Limited, had made an unsolicited proposal to provide maintenance services for the locomotives over a five-year period, a cabinet statement said.

However, a committee appointed to study this proposal by the previous government has said that Sri Lanka Railways has the capacity to maintain the locomotives. (Colombo/Dec10/2024)
