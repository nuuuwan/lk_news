Do not share examination results papers on social media: Prof. Amaratunge

Colombo, June 4 (Daily Mirror) - University Grants Commission (UGC) Chairman, Prof. Sampath Amaratunge, has urged students and parents not to share their 2023 (2024) GCE Advanced Level (A/L) examination results on social media.

He informed the Daily Mirror that there have been several reports of incidents involving the misuse of examination result details by unknown individuals.

"Examination result sheets are unique documents that serve as a means of individual identification for students by the ministry. Sharing copies of these documents, including the index number, can compromise the identity of the genuine owner of the result sheet," he explained," he said.

"Many people can misuse this information for personal benefits, such as applying to foreign universities, obtaining scholarships, or engaging in sensitive activities. There have been several incidents reported where information of the genuine owners was altered by others. They have even changed details on the examination login portal," he said.

Therefore, Prof. Amaratunge requested that students and parents refrain from sharing examination result details on social media.
