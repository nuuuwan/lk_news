SLPP MPs barred from going public on their support for presidential candidates

Colombo, April 11 (Daily Mirror)- In the wake of SLPP (Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna) MPS airing contrasting views over the upcoming elections, the party hierarchy has barred all MPS from making comments on their support to any presidential candidate until a formal decision is taken, a party official said yesterday.

The partyâ€™s executive committee took this decision at its meeting held last Tuesday.

The SLPP is currently divided on its support, with those holding positions in the government openly supporting the proposed candidacy of President Ranil Wickremesinghe.among them are ministers Susil Premajayantha, Prasanna Ranatunga and Ali Sabry.

Another faction insists on fielding its own candidate. Also, the party has decided to take stern disciplinary action against those who sided with other parties, violating the party constitution.
