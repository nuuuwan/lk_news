Reduce price of ‘Gal arrack’ before New Year: State Minister

Parliament, Feb. 21 (Daily Mirror)- The government must reduce the price of special arrack (Gal arrack) before the New Year for the common man to take a booze, State Minister Chamara Sampath said today.

He told Parliament that prices of arrack had gone up exorbitantly and that people tend to drink illicit liquor (Kasippu).

"The price of a bottle of Gal arrack has gone up. People now drink illicit liquor. Taverns are deserted. People cannot drink 'Kasippu' every day. They need to drink 'Gal arrack' at least for the New Year," he said.

The State Minister said a bottle of Gal arrack can be reduced to Rs. 1,500 adding that spirits needed to brew arrack can be obtained from Pelwatte, Sewanagala and Ethimale.
