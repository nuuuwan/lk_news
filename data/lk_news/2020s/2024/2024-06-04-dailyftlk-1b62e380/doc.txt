Stop being source of political jokes – Madduma Bandara tells UNP

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara yesterday said the United National Party (UNP), led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, has become a source of political jokes in the country today. Addressing a press conference following the UNP’s decision to reinstate his party membership, Ranjith Madduma Bandara expressed his disappointment, stating that the current leaders of the UNP, who consider themselves party leaders, are not even familiar with its constitution. Madduma Bandara, who was a UNP member until 2019, lamented the state of the party under its current leadership. His party membership was suspended in 2020 by the UNP after he joined fellow UNP member Sajith Premadasa to form the rival Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB). According to reports, during the UNP working committee meeting chaired by leader Ranil Wickremesinghe on Monday, the party also decided to continue disciplinary action against Madduma Bandara.“They have no right to hold a disciplinary inquiry against me,” he said. Madduma Bandara also noted the many claims by the UNP of SJB members leaving its fold to join the UNP. “We ask the UNP to stop becoming a source of political jokes,” he said.
