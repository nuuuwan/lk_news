Profood Propack & Agbiz 2024 kicks off

The most eagerly awaited food industry exhibition, the Profood Propack, Agbiz and Knowledge Hub 2024 Exhibition organised by the Sri Lanka Food Processors Association (SLFPA) together with Lanka Exhibition and Conference Services (LECS), kicked off yesterday at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Exhibition and Convention Centre, Colombo.

The event was endorsed and supported by the Industries Ministry, the National Agribusiness Council, and the Institute of Food Science and Technology Sri Lanka.

This is the 21st edition of the exhibition and the three-day event will conclude on 25 August.

SLFPA’s commitment to promoting the advancement of the food industry and driving economic growth in Sri Lanka through this exhibition has been well known over the years. The event acts as a catalyst in bringing together food industry leaders, various stakeholders and decision-makers from agri-based companies, food processing industries, packaging, and all service providers to the food industry.

The exhibition covers the entire spectrum of the industry under one roof, with a ‘Farm to Fork’ theme. It will showcase a wide range of products, services, and innovations related to agriculture, processed foods, beverages, packaging, and knowledge sharing. The exhibition is expected to attract key industry stakeholders and decision-makers, including exporters, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), supermarket buyers, HoReCa industry professionals, Government officials, farmers, and the general public.

The exhibition provides numerous opportunities for SMEs to display and promote their products. SMEs play a vital role in the growth of the industry and this event enables them to gain exposure, build relationships, and explore potential collaborations with key stakeholders. Exhibiting at Profood Propack, Agbiz and Knowledge Hub 2024 offers SMEs unparalleled opportunities to expand their reach, increase brand visibility, and forge strategic partnerships by engaging with key stakeholders and accessing a pool of buyers and investors.

This landmark event will bring together industry leaders, stakeholders, and decision-makers from the agriculture, food processing, and packaging industries, and importantly, academia, who will bring new insights to the food science fraternity.

As the largest exhibition in Sri Lanka dedicated to agriculture, food, beverages, and packaging, the Profood Propack, Agbiz and Knowledge Hub Exhibition has contributed significantly to the macroeconomic growth of the country.

The Knowledge Hub facilitates networking with colleagues and experts, sharing knowledge, insights and best practices, learning from experience, and inspiring innovation and new technologies. The Innovative Food Fiesta serves as a platform to showcase advances and innovations in the food industry, where you can showcase your products and introduce them to the target market.
