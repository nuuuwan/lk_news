The SJB Senior Vice President, Sujeewa Senasinghe said that the policy statement has now been finalized.

Meanwhile, Samagi Jana Balawegaya’s (SJB) Presidential candidate and Leader of the Opposition, Sajith Premadasa, emphasized that the policy of maximum power devolution within one country will be implemented under an SJB government.

Speaking at a rally in Trincomalee, Premadasa outlined his vision for governance, which includes holding an international donor conference aimed at advancing development in the North and East.

“We will hold an international donor conference that will help develop the Northern and Eastern regions”, said the opposition leader.

“At the same time, especially through the devolution of power within one state and giving the power to the people, we will make the implementation of that devolution of maximum power our policy,” he said.

He also vowed to end the era where the central government arbitrarily seizes the responsibility which has been provided to the provincial councils.

Premadasa also pledged that the SJB will hold provincial council elections shortly after winning the presidential election and assured to enhance the efficiency of the provincial council system to ensure development in the North and East.
