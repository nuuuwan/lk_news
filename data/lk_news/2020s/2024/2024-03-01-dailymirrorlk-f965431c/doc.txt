Etihad increases frequency of flight operations to Colombo from May 1

The national carrier of the United Arab Emirates, Etihad Airways, will increase the frequency of flight operations to Colombo effective May 1, Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) (Private) Limited Chairman Eng. Athula Galketiya said.

He said this flight service will be a significant contribution towards boosting the tourism industry in Sri Lanka and travel to the Middle East and other key destinations in the world.

"Etihad Airways, which has 10 weekly flight frequencies at present, will be operating 13 flights a week from May 1 (2 flights on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, 1 flight on Wednesdays) and 20 flights per week from June 15 (03 flights on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, 2 flights on Wednesdays)," he said.

The enhancement of flight operations by the airline is part of Etihad's ambitious expansion of flights and frequencies to further boost Abu Dhabi’s global reach, offering more flexible travel options for its guests.

Etihad’s Chief Revenue and Commercial Officer, Arik De, said, “These latest flight increases are aligned with our seamless and practical connections in Abu Dhabi, and our growing global network offers our guests more opportunities to fly where they want to at a time that suits them. It also makes it easier to enjoy a fantastic visit or stopover in Abu Dhabi as an integral part of their journey.”
