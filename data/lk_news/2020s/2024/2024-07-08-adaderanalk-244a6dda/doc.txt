Govt to impose taxes on 14 previously untaxed sectors

Sri Lanka’s State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya stated that the government intends to collect taxes from 14 previously untaxed sectors that have been overlooked until now and to ensure tax compliance from them.

Speaking to reporters in Kegalle, he stated that further inquiries have been commenced in this regard.

The State Minister said that no one has been given an opportunity to evade tax payments and that there has previously never been such a time when such special attention was paid to the paying of taxes.

The State Minister further stated that last year they highlighted 14 sectors that must register for tax payments including large-scale tuition classes, private schools, private medical services, engineering services and surveying services.

“The Inland Revenue Department is conducting inquiries related to the income of all entities registered under these fourteen sectors,” said Siyambalapitiya.
