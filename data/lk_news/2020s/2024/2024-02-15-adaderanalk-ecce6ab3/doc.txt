Phase 1 of Anuradhapura North Water Supply project declared open

The initial stage of the Anuradhapura North Water Supply project, aimed at delivering clean drinking water to the local population, was declared open on Thursday morning (Feb.15).

President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the President of Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Dr. Tanaka Akihito graced the event, at the invitation of Minister Jeevan Thondaman.

JICA provided funding to construct water supply facilities in Anuradhapura North where the people depend on unsafe ground water which causes dental fluorosis.

This water supply project is expected to contribute to improving living standards, hygienic status and health conditions in the area.
