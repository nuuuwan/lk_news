Sri Lanka hotel school lacks infrastructure to accommodate students: Official

ECONOMNYEXT – Sri Lanka’s hotel school lacks the infrastructure to accommodate most students, its Chairman Shirantha Peiris said.

“We have 10,153 applicants but we can only take 15 percent of the applicants due to the lack of infrastructure,” Peris told reporters this week.

“We can have 20,000 [students] if we have another building.”

Applicants to the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management have to sit for a competitive exam on general knowledge and hospitality before facing an interview.

Peiris said that the examination process has been outsourced to promote transparency and avoid nepotism.

Sri Lanka’s tourism industry has seen a positive growth, with the country welcoming 1.13 million tourists from January to July 2024 and the country set to welcome 2.3 million tourists by the end of the year.

Hotel chains such as ITC and Sofia Colombo opened in Sri Lanka are providing jobs for an increasing number of people in the tourism sector.

“We have written to the president asking him for a new building so we can get more students,” Peiris said.

Tourism accounted for nearly 5 percent of Sri Lanka’s economy when the sector was at its peak in 2018. Since then it has hit by violent Easter Sunday suicide attack in 2019 and Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 followed by an unprecedented economic crisis. (Colombo/Jul27/2024)
