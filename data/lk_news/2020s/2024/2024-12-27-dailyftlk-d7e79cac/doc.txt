SJB sets up special unit to probe alleged politicised transfers

The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has announced the establishment of a special unit to investigate what it alleges are arbitrary transfers of public officials at the Government and provincial council levels.

In a statement issued by the party, General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara called on the Government and provincial council authorities to immediately suspend all such transfers. He also invited the public to provide information regarding these transfers, either anonymously or voluntarily, to aid the investigation.

The statement highlighted concerns over a systematic program of transferring public officials in key sectors without just cause. This, it claimed, has disrupted the work of Local Government Assistant Commissioners, Local Government Secretaries, and Cooperative Assistant Development Commissioners, among others.

The SJB criticised the Government for what it described as a betrayal of its promise to uphold the independence of the public service. “The Government, which came to power pledging to ensure public service independence, is now engaging in unprecedented levels of politicisation,” the statement said.

It further alleged that the transfers are part of a strategy to influence the upcoming local government elections and ongoing cooperative society elections, with a focus on gaining political advantage.

“These politically motivated transfers not only disrupt services in various fields but also cause significant personal hardships to the affected officials,” the statement added.

The SJB emphasised its commitment to addressing the issue and ensuring that the public service remains independent and functional, free from undue political influence.
