Sri Lanka gazettes bill to change Article 83 of the constitution

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has published a gazette notice to change Article 83 of the constitution which has a reference to a six year term of the President.

“Article 83 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka is hereby amended in paragraph (b) thereof, by the substitution for the words “to over six years,”, of the words “to over five years,” the gazette notice issued on the orders of President Ranil Wickremesinghe says.

There is a discrepancy in the Article 83 with reference to a six year term, while the rest of the constitution, refers to a five year term.

Opposition parties and lawyers have charged that the legal process involving changing the constitution could potentially delay the upcoming Presidential elections. (Colombo/July19/2024)
