Starting work, transactions and partaking of meals

Food holds great significance in Sri Lankan New Year celebrations. Traditional sweets like Kavum, Athirasa, Konda Kevum, Unduvel, and Kokis are staples.

The auspicious time to start work, transactions, and have the first meal is 12:06 a.m. on April 14. Wear blue attire and face south for luck.
