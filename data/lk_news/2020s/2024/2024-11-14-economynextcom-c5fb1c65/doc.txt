Sri Lanka President’s NPP sweeps Galle, Ratnapura postal votes

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s National People’s Power of Anura Kumara Dissanayake polled 79 percent or 32,298 votes in postal votes of the Galle district, made up mainly of state workers.

The election, acclaimed as the most people, was held amid a fragmented opposition and the lowest turnout for a general election since 2010.

“We definitely believe we will (get a majority),” Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya told reporters after voting earlier in the day.

“After the Presidential elections many who did not vote for us, are now looking at us favorably.

“The false scares that were made about us has now been shown to be false. Also the way we worked in the past two months.”

Samagi Jana Balawegaya of Sajith Premadasa polled 8.63 percent or 3,526 votes.

The New Democratic Front led by ex-President Ranil Wickremesinghe polled 1,984.
