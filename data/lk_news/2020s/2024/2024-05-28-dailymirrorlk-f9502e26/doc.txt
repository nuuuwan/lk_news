SJB Lawyers’ Federation proposes legal reforms for system change

Colombo, May 28 (Daily Mirror) - The SJB Lawyers' Federation stated that they have proposed 116 measures for significant legal reforms aimed at affecting a system change in the country.

President's Counsel Upul Jayasuriya, the President of the SJB Lawyers' Federation, made these remarks while addressing a media conference in Colombo and mentioned that these proposals will be included in the SJB manifesto.

Jayasuriya stated that a proposal has been made to enact new laws within six months of the election to freeze and confiscate the assets of individuals holding unaccounted assets, following an investigative process supervised by the judiciary.

He further mentioned that the same team of investigators, who were victimized while carrying out their duties, will be redeployed with additional staff to recover the stolen assets to the country.

He further stated that there has been a proposal to refile all the bribery cases that were withdrawn due to the absence of signatures from all commissioners on the warrants. He reiterated the necessity for the Bribery Commission to be allocated sufficient funds to recruit experts in the relevant fields.

“All Ministers and Members of Parliament shall have only one security guard. If additional security is deemed necessary, its cost shall be borne personally by them. Furthermore, only one official vehicle shall be assigned to Ministers and Parliamentarians,” Jayasuriya added.

Meanwhile, Senior Counsel Janaka Edirisinghe stated that the SJB has put forth a proposal to address the issues within the legal system, which would inevitably enhance the people’s confidence in the system.

“If these proposals are implemented, youths will not leave this country, and a system that upholds the rule of law will be established in the country,” Edirisinghe added.

He further mentioned that people have been given the opportunity to develop the country's legal system under a leadership committed to achieve these objectives.
