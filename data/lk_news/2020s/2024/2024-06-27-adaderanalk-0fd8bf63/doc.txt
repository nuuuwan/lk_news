Keheliya’s writ petition fixed for further consideration

The Court of Appeal has order for the writ petition filed on behalf of former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella to be taken up for further consideration on July 01.

Rambukwella’s petition seeks to invalidate the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court order to place him in remand custody until the conclusion of the trial concerning the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) vials.

When the case was taken for consideration today (27), Deputy Solicitor General Nirmalan Wigneswaran presented the facts to the court on behalf of the Attorney General.
