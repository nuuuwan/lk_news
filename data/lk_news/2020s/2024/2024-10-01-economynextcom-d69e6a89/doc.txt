Sri Lanka’s new president to review IMF deal before discussing

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s government under newly elected President Anura Kumara Dissanayake will review the island nation’s deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), new Cabinet Spokesman Vijitha Herath said.

Dissanayake’s Marxists-led National People/s Power (NPP) during the election campaign has repeatedly said it would renegotiate the IMF deal as people in general are facing difficulties due to the global lender’s deal signed under the previous government led by Ranil Wickremesinghe.

“First of all, we will review what is the content of the agreement. Then we will go forward,” Herath told reporters at the new government’s first weekly news briefing to announce cabinet decisions.

“We have not taken any new decisions during yesterday’s cabinet meeting.”

An IMF team will be in Sri Lanka from October 2-4 to meet President Dissanayake and his economic council to have some preliminary discussion on the IMF deal.

Herath said the meeting is a courtesy call and nothing will be in depth. (Colombo/October 01/2024)
