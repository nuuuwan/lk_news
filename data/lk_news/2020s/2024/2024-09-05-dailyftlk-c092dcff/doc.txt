Arundika becomes independent while pleading with RW-Sajith to unite against NPP

Says he will join any group working towards defeating NPP which he referred to as an “unholy” alliance

Urges all politicians who respect democracy to come together to oppose politics of hate and revenge

Questions lack of support for President from parties to Govt. and asks if some force is in play to ensure an NPP win

Accuses NPP of manipulating citizens, especially youth to gain their support

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Puttalam District MP and State Minister of Urban Development and Housing Arundika Fernando has announced he will function as an independent MP going forward. Fernando made this announcement in Parliament yesterday.

Fernando expressed his frustration, stating that the country’s democracy is facing a death knell.

“Today, a group that once destroyed the country has brainwashed the people into believing a lie that, over the past 76 years since independence, leaders and governments have done nothing for the people. They have made this falsehood widely accepted and are leading the country toward further destruction,” he said.

Fernando noted that he has always worked hard to serve the people and, along with other politicians present, has made sacrifices for this cause. He acknowledged, however, that certain policy decisions may have contributed to the current situation in Sri Lanka.

“But as the country is being led toward destruction, if there are any leaders who still respect democracy and oppose the politics of hate, revenge, and the destruction of houses and Parliament, now is the time for them to come together,” he said.

Fernando stressed that those who are trying to move forward with a plan to stop and defeat the “anti-democratic group” must be allowed to do so.

He expressed frustration over the lack of support from other parties within the Government for the United National Party (UNP) group backing Wickremesinghe. He noted that there was initial confidence that Wickremesinghe could stabilise the country, which is why they supported him, but now it appears some other force is at play. He questioned whether there is an attempt to bring an “unholy” alliance to power while refraining from directly naming the National People’s Power (NPP) party led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake. He accused them of manipulating the minds of the youth to gain their support.

He urged everyone to join forces and work together against the National People’s Power (NPP), stating he was willing to collaborate with anyone capable of achieving this goal.

Fernando also strongly urged that President Wickremesinghe and Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa should consider working together if possible.

“I have never even met Sajith Premadasa. The Prime Minister knows that we are doing this work sincerely. At this time of crisis, I bring my hands together and request that, if possible, the leader of the Opposition and the President should unite. If possible, let these two groups join forces,” he said. “I will say one last thing, starting today I will function as an independent MP. As an independent MP, I will negotiate and join anyone who can defeat this unholy alliance,” he added.

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Talatha Athukorala recently resigned from her position as an MP after making a special statement warning of a serious threat from the NPP. Following her resignation, reports have emerged of attempts to broker a marriage between President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa to prevent an NPP win at the upcoming elections. It is in this context; Arundika Fernando made a special statement yesterday.
