AKD to meet Tamil and Muslim diaspora in Canada

National Peopleâ€™s Party (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake will tour Canada this week to meet supporters of the party residing in the country.

The party said Dissanayake left for Canada on Wednesday and will address several public gatherings during his visit.

Dissanayake is slated to speak at two gatherings arranged by the NPP Canada Committee on 23 and 24 March. The initial meeting is set to take place in Toronto, followed by the second meeting in Vancouver.

The NPP leader will also meet with members of the Sri Lankan Muslim and Tamil diaspora residing in Canada during the visit. The visit will highlight the importance of engaging with the Sri Lankan diaspora and fostering closer ties between Canada and Sri Lanka.

Dissanayake met with Canadian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Eric Walsh at the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Office in March where his Canadian visit was also taken up for discussion. At the time Walsh extended his wishes to Dissanayake for the visit.
