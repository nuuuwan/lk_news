Sir Keir Starmer officially becomes UK’s prime minister

Sir Keir Starmer has officially become the UK’s new prime minister after a meeting with the King.

The Labour leader had his meeting in Buckingham Palace after Rishi Sunak stepped down following the worst ever general election result for the Conservatives.

Sir Keir now takes over as the first Labour prime minister in 14 years - and the seventh Labour prime minister ever.

Much of the country was turned red overnight, with Mr Sunak conceding defeat just before 5am on Friday and Sir Keir claiming victory shortly after.

Speaking on the steps of No 10, former prime minister Mr Sunak said he would not leave his role as Conservative Party leader immediately but would do so once a leadership race begins.

“I would like to say, first and foremost, I am sorry. I have given this job my all,” he said.

“But you have sent a clear signal that the government of the United Kingdom must change. And yours is the only judgement that matters.

“I have heard your anger, your disappointment and I take responsibility for this loss.”

Mr Sunak also wished Sir Keir and his family well, adding: “Whatever our disagreements in this campaign, he is a decent, public-spirited man who I respect.

“He and his family deserve the very best of our understanding as they make the huge transition to their new lives behind this door and as he grapples with this most demanding of jobs in an increasingly unstable world.”
