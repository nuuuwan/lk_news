He also called on the public to celebrate this Easter by leading our hearts to a new transformation that is fostered by the said values.

“Let us enlighten our lives through the life of Jesus Christ.

Let us resolve in this Easter day to put society on the right track by focusing on human relations and social ethics in the face of current, complex social misapprehensions.

The life example of Jesus Christ, who sacrificed his life for social justice, mercy, love and humanity in order to achieve righteous goals courageously, is extremely valuable.

The said religious teachings help us build the necessary mindset that is required in any crisis situation.

This is a time that social values influenced by the life of Jesus, who has spread mercy and love, should be socialized again and again. Let us celebrate this Easter by leading our hearts to a new transformation that is fostered by the said values.”
