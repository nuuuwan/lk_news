Indian legislator, 37, dies in car accident

Sangareddy, Feb 23 (India Today) -  G Lasya Nanditha, a prominent Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) politician and Member of the Telangana Legislative Assembly, died in a car accident in Sangareddy on Friday.

The accident occurred on the Sultanpur Outer Ring Road (ORR) in the district’s Aminpur mandal. Nanditha, 37, was travelling in an SUV when it reportedly lost control and collided with the divider, leading to fatal injuries for the MLA.

She was rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared her dead on arrival. The driver was critically injured in the crash and is currently receiving medical treatment.

Sangareddy Superintendent of Police CH Rupesh said, "Lasya Nanditha was travelling from Basara towards Gatchibowli. It is suspected that the driver may have fallen asleep at the wheel. The vehicle sustained significant damage to the front side. Additionally, her personal security officer was injured in the accident. Initially, she was taken to a private hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Her body is being shifted to a government hospital for a PME."

Born in 1986 in Hyderabad, Lasya Nanditha made her foray into politics around a decade ago. She served as a corporator in the Kavadiguda ward before being elected as MLA from Secunderabad Cantonment in the 2023 Telangana assembly elections.

Her father, G Sayanna, previously held the Secunderabad Cantonment seat but passed away earlier in 2023. Following his passing, Nanditha secured the BRS nomination and won the election.

In a statement issued by his office, BRS chief K Chandrashekar Rao condoled Lasya Nanditha's death and assured all support by the party to her bereaved family.
