Sri Lanka seeks PPP to install solar panels on 300 railway stations: Transport minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will call for expressions of interest for public private partnerships to install solar panels on 300 railway stations around the island, Minister of Transport Bandula Gunawardena said.

“Areas in the north and east especially, and also to the south in Hambanthota, receive a lot of sunlight. It would be advantageous for the Railways if we can make a profit with solar panels on the stations’ roofs,” Gunawardena told reporters.

The cabinet approved his proposal to call for tenders for PPPs, he said. Previous expressions of interest will be disregarded and new ones will be called instead.

State-run Sri Lanka Railways has been exploring new avenues to boost its revenue including leasing spaces above some stations located in strategic locations, streamlining illegal occupancy of its lands, and increasing transport of goods and parcels.

The island nation’s more than a century old railway has yet to make breakeven in its operations.

The loss-making institution has already given some trains to be operated by private sector while starting new trains targeting tourists. (Colombo/Aug13/2024)
