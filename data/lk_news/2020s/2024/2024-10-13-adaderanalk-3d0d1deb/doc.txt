Severe weather affects over 76,000 people across 11 districts

The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) reports that severe weather conditions, including floods, strong winds, and fallen trees, have affected 76,218 individuals from 18,795 families across 11 districts in Sri Lanka.

The Gampaha District has been the hardest hit, with 68,672 people from 16,707 families impacted.

Tragically, the disaster has claimed two lives, while two others have sustained injuries. Additionally, 223 houses have suffered partial damage, according to the DMC.

Meanwhile, the Irrigation Department noted a decrease in water levels for the Attanagalu Oya, Kelani, Gin, Nilwala, and Kalu rivers, following minimal rainfall over the past 24 hours. However, Irrigation Engineer from the Hydrology and Disaster Management Division, Mrs. Sakura Dilthara cautioned that some areas remain submerged.

“Though rainfall has subsided in many areas, the water levels in the Attanagalu Oya, Kalu, Kelani, and Gin river basins are still high. Residents, particularly in low-lying areas, should remain vigilant as the threat of flooding persists. Any future significant rainfall could quickly return these rivers to flood conditions,” she warned.

Meanwhile, the National Building Research Organization (NBRO) has extended landslide warnings for 47 Divisional Secretariat divisions across nine districts. The advisory remains in effect until 4.00 p.m. today.

Authorities are urging residents in affected regions to stay alert and heed all safety precautions as weather conditions continue to pose risks.
