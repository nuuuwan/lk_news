CameraLK empowers Sri Lankan talent at Sony’s inaugural Kando Trip Southeast Asia

Sony successfully concluded its first-ever Kando Trip Southeast Asia, a landmark event held from 14 to 16 August in the stunning backdrop of Bali, Indonesia. This invite-only event brought together over 130 creators from across nine countries, including seven outstanding Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) from Sri Lanka, supported by CameraLK, the country’s leading camera retailer and Sony’s authorised dealer in Sri Lanka and Maldives.

Representing Sri Lanka at this prestigious event were Thilina Kaluthotage, Lakshitha Karunarathna, Priyantha Bandara, Arantha Sirimanne, Ravee Ranasinghe, and the popular internet personalities Janai Priyai. These talented creators had the unique opportunity to collaborate, learn, and push the boundaries of their creative visions using the latest Sony Alpha gear during the three-day immersive experience.

Sony’s Kando Trip, named after the Japanese word “Kando,” which evokes a sense of awe and emotion when experiencing something beautiful and amazing for the first time, reflects the company’s core philosophy of inspiring creativity and fostering community among creators. Originally launched in North America in 2017, the Kando Trip has quickly become one of the most anticipated events in the global creative community.

The 2024 Kando Trip Southeast Asia featured an array of engaging photography and videography challenges, along with mentorship sessions from renowned Alpha creators. Participants were introduced to Sony’s latest innovations, including the newly released ZV-E10 II and the professional Cinema Line cameras, which they tested at Experience Demo Zones led by acclaimed creators ZY Cheng and Bagoes Tresna Adji.

Day two saw the creators’ journey to Penglipuran Village, where they captured the vibrant cultural essence of Bali through their lenses. Sri Lankan KOLs, alongside their peers, engaged in activities like portrait photography of batik artists, dynamic gamelan performances, and traditional Balinese dances. The Video Creators, including Sri Lanka’s representatives, explored the art of storytelling through motion, creating mini-documentaries that showcased the intricate process of batik-making and the picturesque beauty of Bali’s village life. The event culminated at Kommune Beach Club, where creators were challenged to capture fast-action scenes, editorial fashion shoots, and cinematic beachside moments, pushing the limits of their creative and technical skills.

CameraLK Managing Director Anushka Gunasinghe expressed his pride in the Sri Lankan contingent’s participation: “We are thrilled to have supported these incredible Sri Lankan creators at Sony’s first Kando Trip Southeast Asia. Their ability to collaborate, learn, and innovate alongside some of the best talents in the region is a testament to the creative potential we have in Sri Lanka. At CameraLK, we are committed to empowering our local creators by providing them with the best tools and opportunities to excel on the global stage.”

The Kando Trip 2024 offered participants not only the chance to experiment with cutting-edge Sony gear but also to forge lasting connections with fellow creators from across Southeast Asia. As Sony continues to inspire and empower creators worldwide, CameraLK remains dedicated to supporting Sri Lankan talent, ensuring they have the platform and resources needed to shine in the global creative community.
