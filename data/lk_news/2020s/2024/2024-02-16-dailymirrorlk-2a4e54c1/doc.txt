Colombo, Feb 16 (Daily Mirror)- Agreements have been signed to initiate direct flights between Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) and Tel Aviv in Israel, the Ports, Shipping and Aviation Ministry said.

It said diplomatic agreements were signed today between Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, and Israeli Transport and Road Safety Minister Ms. Miri Regive.

According to Ministry sources, the new service will commence from March this year on a scheduled timetable.

These A321 aircraft have the capacity to carry almost 300 passengers at a time.

Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said that several other airlines in Israel have also expressed their consent to start air services between the two airports.

Minister Silva said with nearly twenty thousand Sri Lankan workers engaged in various jobs in Israel, this direct flight service is very convenient to fly between the two countries and it is possible to get air tickets at a lower price than at present.

The Israeli Transport Minister said that a large number of tourists from Israel are looking forward to visit Sri Lanka and said that this will lead to the development of bilateral relations between the two countries.

The Israeli Minister said she will provide the necessary technical assistance to expand the facilities of Sri Lanka's airports and said that she will inform the Israeli Parliament about this agreement.
