Colombo, Jan. 31 (Daily Mirror)- The Supreme Court awarded Rs.2 million against the four police officers attached to the Kosgoda Police Station, as compensation for subjecting to arbitrary arrest of a police constable and his wife.

While holding that four policemen, including the OIC of the Kosgoda Police Station have violated the Fundamental Rights of the Police Constable in terms of Articles 12(1),13(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution, the Supreme Court observed that the Sri Lanka Police have been vested with the duty of maintaining the law and that they are the guardians of public safety.

The Supreme Court further observed that the facts and circumstances of this case raise the question of who guards the guards.

The Supreme Court held that the compensation should be paid by the four policemen out of their personal funds. The State is directed to pay a sum of Rs. 25,000 each to the petitioner and his wife.

The Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Justices Preethi Padman Surasena, Janak de Silva and Priyantha Fernando observed that the OIC of the Kosgoda Police Station Mangala De Soyza, Inspector Asela Premanath and Police Sergeant Indika de Silva have repeatedly filed false actions against the petitioner P.D.A. Panapitiya.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court ordered that a copy of this judgment be forwarded to the National Police Commission for it to take appropriate disciplinaryÂ  actions against the respondents.

Counsel Geeth Karunarathna with Bhagya Peiris appeared for the petitioners, while Deputy Solicitor General Anoopa de Silva appeared for the Attorney General.
