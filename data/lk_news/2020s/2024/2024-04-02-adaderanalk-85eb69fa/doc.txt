Ehelepola Walawwa to be handed over to Dalada Maligawa

The Cabinet of Ministers has green-lighted a proposal seeking to hand over the historic Ehalepola Walawwa and the grounds over to the Sri Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the Tooth Relic) in Kandy through a title deed of sacred premises.

In accordance with a decision taken in the Cabinet meeting held on 19 February 2024, the Presidentâ€™s Secretary had been informed to discuss with all the relevant parties and submit a report with recommendations to the Cabinet regarding the handing over of the ancestral home of Ehelepola Disawe and his family to the Temple of the Tooth Relic.

As per the report, the Dalada Maligawa has prepared a project, aiming to present its history in a more attractive way to the society by establishing a museum at this ancestral home to represent the great historical and environmental background of the Kingdom of Kandy that existed hundreds of years ago and to make it a local and foreign tourist attraction.

On that account, the report has recommended that this establishment should be transferred to the Dalada Maligawa for the aforementioned purpose.
