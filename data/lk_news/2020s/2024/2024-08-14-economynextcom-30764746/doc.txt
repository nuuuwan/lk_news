Sri Lanka tobacco taxes, sales down in the June 2024 quarter

ECONOMYNEXT – Ceylon Tobacco Company, Sri Lanka’s sole legal cigarette maker said volumes fell in the June 2024 quarter from a year earlier amid higher taxes, with total revenues and taxes also falling.

Revenue fell to 50.32 billion rupees in the June 2024 quarter from 54.76 billion rupees, while taxes paid on revenues fell to 34.7 billion rupees from 40.58 billion rupees.

“The decline in volume is consequential to the successive increases in excise duties and other taxes over the course of the last two years,” CTC told shareholders the quarterly accounts.

“Company also took steps to export tobacco leaf which partially mitigated the loss in overall turnover.”

Revenues in the June quarter showed a pick up from 45.8 billion rupees.

The company boosted pre-tax profits to 12.0 billion rupees, from 10.3 billion rupees and provided 4.8 billion rupees in income taxes, up from4.0 billion last year.
