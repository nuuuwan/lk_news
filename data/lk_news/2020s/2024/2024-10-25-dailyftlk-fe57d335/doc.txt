Marikkar calls for strong opposition to safeguard democracy

Says Govt. is downplaying need for an opposition and stresses it undermines democracy

Claims “communist parties” are aiming to establish a one-party State and it is a grave threat

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Colombo district candidate S.M. Marikkar has strongly criticised the current Government’s approach to governance, calling for a robust opposition to safeguard the country’s democracy.

Adressing a press conference at the Samagi Jana Sandhana head office in Colombo yesterday Marikkar highlighted that the present Government has downplayed the need for an opposition. He said such a stance undermines the very foundation of democracy.  “The majority of the people in the country are not represented by the current Government. It is essential to protect democracy, which is a primary responsibility of any Government. Equally, it is the responsibility of the people to ensure that this democracy is preserved,” he said.

Drawing attention to past governance failures, Marikkar referenced the tenure of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. He pointed out that the majority given to Rajapaksa in Parliament led to arbitrary decision making, such as the controversial fertilizer ban that hampered agricultural productivity.

“During that time, money was printed recklessly, causing inflation to skyrocket. The prices of essential goods soared, and people were left without fuel, electricity, and even the ability to pay loan instalments. Eventually, these actions led to the country’s bankruptcy,” Marikkar said.

He also warned of the dangers posed by communist parties in the country, alleging that their ultimate goal is to establish a one-party state without an opposition. “This is a grave threat to democracy. A country needs an opposition to stand up for the rights of the people, to speak and fight for them,” Marikkar emphasised, urging the public to come forward and work towards forming a balanced system of governance.

In addition to discussing democratic concerns, Marikkar criticised the current Government for failing to address the expectations of the people. “Catching the thieves who looted the country’s wealth is important, but the people expected much more. After the new Government came to power, there were hopes for relief measures to reduce the burdens of daily life,” he said.

He went on to question the Government’s economic strategy, noting that there has been no clear plan to strengthen the economy, boost various industries, or increase the country’s revenue streams. Marikkar also pointed out that promises made during election campaigns, such as reducing taxes and lowering the prices of essential goods, have yet to be fulfilled.

“We need a Government that not only talks about catching thieves but also takes concrete steps to improve the lives of the people,” Marikkar stressed.
