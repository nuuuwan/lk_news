Of that safety concern

It was former US President Donald Trump’s ear that an assassin’s bullet grazed the other day, but we had the presidential candidates in Sri Lanka holding their ears and screaming, so to speak; they have claimed that they are facing threats to their lives. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has reportedly ordered threat assessments prior to considering their requests for enhanced security, if necessary.

The need for ensuring the safety of presidential candidates cannot be overstated. It is incumbent upon the government to do everything in its power to hold elections, presidential or otherwise, free from violence and malpractices, which have undermined the electoral process and weakened democracy.

Equally, threats that electors face must also not go unheeded. The main political parties in the presidential fray have committed various crimes against the people, and therefore the potential threats their candidates are likely to pose to the public in the event of being elected to the highest position in the land must also be assessed properly. This is a task for the people themselves.

Most political parties seeking to secure the presidency have a history of committing heinous crimes to compass their ends. All of them have perpetrated grave economic crimes against the country either by destroying public property in the name of revolutions or by selling state assets at fire-sale prices to their cronies in addition to borrowing recklessly and bankrupting the economy.

As for those who flaunt their Utopian dreams, it behoves the people to act wisely when they vote lest they should make the same mistake as the dwellers of Hamelin, who secured the help of Pied Piper to rid their city of rats and eventually lost their children at his hands. We hear again the mesmerising sound of the pipe, which lured many young Sri Lankans into a lemming-like rush to self-destruction in the past.

The electors had better realise that no candidate or party is worth dying for. Sadly, blinded by party loyalties, they do not act rationally when they engage in election campaigns or cast their votes. Most of them put their lives on the line for the sake of the candidates and political parties of their choice; divisive politics also tears families asunder in half-baked democracies like Sri Lanka. They ought to learn from the fate of an unfortunate UNP supporter who was killed in Kahawatte while campaigning for Maithripala Sirisena in the run-up to the 2015 presidential election. He courageously stood up to a group of thugs working for the Rajapaksas in a bid to prevent an attack on a stage being put up for a rally to be addressed by Sirisena the following day; he was shot dead for offering resistance. Three years later, Sirisena and the Rajapaksas smoked the peace pipe and sought to oust the UNP-led government. In 2022, UNP leader Wickremesinghe closed ranks with the SLPP, of which Sirisena’s SLFP is a constituent, and became the President; he stands accused of protecting the Rajapaksas.

Meanwhile, there are no losers as such in presidential elections, paradoxical as it may sound. Financially speaking, defeat in a presidential race could be as sweet as victory itself for the main contenders, given the colossal amounts of funds that pour into their election war chests; only a fraction thereof is spent, and the balance is stashed away. It was reported recently that a pile of greenbacks belonging to a former presidential candidate had been destroyed by termites.

So, let it be repeated that the government must ensure the protection of all presidential candidates, and the public must act wisely to protect their own interests and be mindful of the danger of making the wrong decisions at future elections, especially the upcoming presidential poll.
