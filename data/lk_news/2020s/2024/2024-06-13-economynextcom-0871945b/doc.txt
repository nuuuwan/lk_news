Sri Lanka in final stages of reaching in-principle deal with CDB: State Minister

ECONOMYNEXT â€“ Sri Lanka is in the final stages of reaching an in-principle agreement to restructure debt of China Development Bank, State Minister for Finance Shehan Semasinghe said.

Sri Lanka has debt classified as commercial and bilateral for China Development Bank according to published debt data.

The International Monetary Fund approved a review on June 12, pending the finalization of bilateral and commercial debt.

Sri Lanka would not have been able to complete the review without the support given by the creditors, Semasinghe said.

Sri Lanka hopes to wrap up final agreement with bilateral creditors and also reach preliminary deals with private creditors before the end of June, he said. (Colombo/June13/2024)
