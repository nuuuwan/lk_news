Police recover car suspected to have been used in shooting of Buddhist monk

Police have recovered the vehicle which is suspected to have been used by the suspects involved in the shooting of a Buddhist monk in Malwathuhiripitiya area of Gampaha earlier today (23 Jan.).

The vehicle was found abandoned in a shrubby area at Godella in Kaduwela, Police said, adding that it had been torched beyond recognition.

According to police, however, another vehicle, bearing the same licence plate as that of the vehicle the suspects had arrived in, was found in a garage in Eluwila, Panadura.

Earlier today, four unidentified individuals had arrived in a car at the temple, and carried out the shooting and fled the scene afterwards, police reported, adding that the shooters had claimed to be officers from the Criminal Investigations Department (CID).

The 45-year-old Buddhist monk, Ven. Kalapaluwawe Dhammarathana Thero, who sustained critical injuries in the incident, had been rushed to the Gampaha Hospital.

However, the monk had later succumbed to injuries this afternoon while receiving treatment at the hospital, according to police.

Ven. Kalapaluwawe Dhammarathana Thero is also reported to have been engaged in various activities and practices related astrology and witchcraft.

Police stated that the shooting has been carried out using a T-56 assault rifle.
