Sri Lanka president’s party claims opposition SJB members to join them after March 10

ECONOMYNEXT — A large group of main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) members will join President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s United National Party (UNP) after March 10, United National Party (UNP) general secretary Palitha Range Bandara claimed.

Fielding questions from reporters on Wednesday February 28, Bandara said that some SJB members are expected to join a UNP rally to be held on March 10 in Kuliyapitiya marking the beginning of Wickremesinghe’s campaign.

“Yes, the SJB will come. I don’t know if all those people mentioned will leave [SJB leader] Sajith Premadasa,” the UNP general secretary said.

“After March 10, a majority of SJBers will join us,” he said.

The National Election Commission has said the presidential election will be held between September 18 and October 18. While opposition parties have expressed concern that the presidential election may not be held this year as scheduled, President Wickremesinghe and spokespersons for the government has said it will definitely be held this year while parliamentary elections will be held in 2025.

“The candidate is President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Preparedness: Excellent,” said Bandara.

At an SJB press conference on Wednesday, SJB MP and chief opposition whip Lakshman Kiriella expressed confidence in his party’s chances at the presidential poll.

“We don’t care who runs. Our horse is ready. We will finish leagues ahead,” he said. (Colombo/Feb29/2024)
