Court of Appeal summons Hajj Committee for contempt of court

The Court of Appeal yesterday summoned all the members of the Hajj Committee and the Director of the Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs for contempt of court.

The Court ordered that they be summoned after a Petition was filed stating that the Hajj committee had acted in violation of a court order.

Previously the Court of Appeal suspended the previous allocation of quotas and ordered a new allocation including a travel agent United Travels.

The Court of Appeal was told yesterday that travel agents were told to flout the order on one hand and the pilgrims were made to fear that the Hajj would not be possible on the other by the Hajj Committee.

Justice N. Samarakone yesterday clarified that there was no suspension of Hajj and that the order was only to include United Travels and reallocate the relevant quotas.

Recordings were played in court where the public were told to violate the court order by the Hajj committee.

Presidentâ€™s Counsel Faizer Musthapha, Farman Cassim, Shaheeda Barrie, Hafeel Farisz appeared for the Petitioner
