Sri Lanka to seek private investor for off-shore wind plants

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet had approved a proposal to seek private investors for large scale off-shore wind power plants, Minister Bandula Gunwardana said.

A feasibility study by the World Bank has found there was a huge potential for off-shore wind energy off the north, west, and south east coasts he said.

Attempts to bring in renewable energy producers without competitive bidding has run into controversy recently.

Minister Gunawardana said he presumed investors will be called in a transparent manner. (Colombo/Feb20/2024)
