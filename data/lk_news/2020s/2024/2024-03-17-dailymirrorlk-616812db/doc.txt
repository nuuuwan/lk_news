Sri Lanka and Bangladesh face off in crucial ODI decider

With both teams facing significant setbacks, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are eagerly eyeing an ODI series win as they prepare to clash in the decider tomorrow (18) at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chattogram.

After Bangladesh secured a convincing victory in the first match, Sri Lanka bounced back strongly in the second ODI, levelling the series at 1-1. However, Sri Lanka's hopes were dealt a blow in the final ODI with Dilshan Madushanka's injury.

The talented fast bowler, who showcased impressive pace and wicket-taking ability in the first two ODI games, will miss the series decider due to a hamstring injury. Madushanka is set to begin rehabilitation work to recover from the injury, with an expected sidelining of several weeks.

The Daily Mirror has learned that Sri Lanka expects to replace Madushanka with either all-rounder Chamika Karunaratne or Mahesh Theekshana. Theekshana, who featured in the opening ODI, was replaced by all-rounder Dunith Wellalage in the second ODI. No further changes are expected for the final ODI aside from Madushanka's absence.

In contrast, Bangladesh has opted to make changes to their batting order. Opener Litton Das has been released from the squad to participate in the Dhaka Premier League, making way for Jaker Ali, the wicketkeeper-batsman who impressed with a solid 68 in the first T20I against Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka holds the upper hand in the head-to-head record in the 50-over format, having won 43 matches compared to Bangladesh's 11 out of their 56 meetings, with two matches ending in no result.

Following the conclusion of the ODI series, Sri Lanka will shift focus to a two-match Test series against Bangladesh commencing on March 22 at Sylhet.
