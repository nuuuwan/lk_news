Colombo, April 17 (Daily Mirror) - Eating a wide range of foods, including sweets, during the Sinhala and Tamil New Year festivities can lead to higher blood sugar and cholesterol levels, Registrar in Clinical Nutrition at the Health Ministry Dr. Janaka Marasinghe said.

He pointed out that people should pay more attention to food and drinks during festive seasons.

"Most of the sweets made during the New Year will come out after the festival. Every house has a considerable collection of different types of food, including sweets and it automatically causes the increase in consumption of these foods. New Year foods consists of more sugar and flour which makes people overweight and increase their diabetic conditions," Dr. Marasinghe said.
