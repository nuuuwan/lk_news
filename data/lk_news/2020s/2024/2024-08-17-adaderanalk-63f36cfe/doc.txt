Sri Lanka strongly object to construction of ‘Tamil Genocide Monument’ in Canada

Sri Lanka’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry summoned the Canadian High Commissioner on Friday (16) to reiterate Sri Lanka’s strong objections conveyed on several occasions previously to the laying of foundation stone for the construction of a so–called “Tamil Genocide Monument” at the Chinguacousy Park in Brampton, Canada on 14 August 2024, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.

Issuing a statement, the ministry stated that Foreign Minister Sabry emphasized that the Government of Sri Lanka categorically rejects this outrageously false narrative, which is being perpetuated for vote bank politics within Canada.

Minister Sabry noted that ill-advised action by the City Council of Brampton is offensive to all peace-loving people in Canada and Sri Lanka. The so-called allegation of a genocide in Sri Lanka is a fabrication based on malicious disinformation and is not substantiated by any responsible authority, nationally or internationally, the statement highlighted.

The Government of Sri Lanka has consistently engaged in efforts to foster reconciliation and build lasting peace following the end of the conflict despite the economic crisis in the country for the last two years, and such divisive action undermines those efforts by glorifying terrorism and sowing discord and mistrust which democratic countries, including Sri Lanka and Canada, cannot endorse, it added.

The Foreign Minister requested the Government of Canada to intervene and take action to prevent the construction of this monument in recognizing the damaging impact of this narrative on bilateral relations and to take immediate action to prevent further harm, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
