Government to establish new Faculty of Medicine at NSBM

Colombo, March 12 (Daily Mirror) - The Cabinet has green-lit the proposal to establish a Faculty of Medicine under the National School of Business Management (NSBM).

The medical college is to be established under the direct supervision and regulation of the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, and the Sri Lanka Medical Council.

The proposal, put forth by the National School of Business Management (NSBM), a fully self-financed institution owned by the government, aims to award MBBS degrees through this institution.

According to the proposal, the medical college intends to enroll approximately 500 local and foreign students annually for the MBBS degree course.

To facilitate clinical training, the institution has sought approval to reserve the Homagama Base Hospital as a suitable government hospital.

The Cabinet of Ministers has already granted approval for the use of Homagama Base Hospital for clinical training of NSBM medical students.

Accordingly, plans are in motion to prepare a mechanism for reserving the hospital on the basis of resource sharing for the clinical training of medical faculty students and professor unit facilities.

Furthermore, the NSBM has committed to providing necessary funds for the development of Homagama Base Hospital to meet the standards of medical education set forth by the Sri Lanka Medical Council.

In light of these developments, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved the proposal presented by the President to take over the Homagama Base Hospital under the purview of the Ministry of Health and upgrade it as a teaching hospital.
