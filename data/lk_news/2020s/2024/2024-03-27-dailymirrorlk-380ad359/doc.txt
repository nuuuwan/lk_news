Kasun Rajitha ruled out of second Bangladesh Test

Sri Lanka suffered an injury setback ahead of the second Test against Bangladesh, starting on Saturday, with fast bowler Kasun Rajitha ruled out with an upper back injury.

Rajitha took eight wickets in Sri Lanka's emphatic 328-run win in the first Test, including a 5 for 56 in Bangladesh's second innings.

Replacing Rajitha in the squad is Asitha Fernando, though Sri Lanka are yet to decide the final composition of their team.

Rajitha will return to Sri Lanka to start rehabilitation work, Sri Lanka Cricket said.
