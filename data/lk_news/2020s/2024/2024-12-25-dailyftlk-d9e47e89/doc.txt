Govt. pledges to tackle underworld activities

The Government yesterday pledged decisive action to address the resurgence of underworld activities and drug smuggling.

“As the Government, we are bound to suppress the underworld and combat drug trafficking. However, we do not intend to rely solely on short-term operations like before. The law enforcement authorities are systematically intervening in this matter,” Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said yesterday.

Speaking that the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing assured the Government’s unwavering commitment to tackling these issues promptly.

Despite disclosing details about the measures underway, he said that actions are already in progress and expressed confidence that the results of these interventions would soon become evident.
