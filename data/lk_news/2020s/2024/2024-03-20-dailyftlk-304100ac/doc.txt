Dialog Enterprise, the corporate ICT solutions arm of Dialog Axiata PLC., in partnership with Bahrain-based award-winning cybersecurity solutions partner, CTM360 has launched a Digital Risk Protection (DRP) platform empowering organisations and enterprises to navigate the digital landscape confidently amidst ever-evolving cybersecurity threats.

A holistic solution stack to address the current cybersecurity challenges faced by organizations, CTM360’s fully integrated security platform operates in real-time, outside the firewall of an organisation, and does not require any configuration or installation.

Proficient in External Attack Surface Management (EASM), CTM360 features cloud-based Auto Discovery of digital assets, maintains a digital asset inventory and is capable of carrying out Security Ratings and External Asset Vulnerability Detection, along with effective mitigation guidelines.

The Digital Risk Protection (DRP) stack features surface, deep and dark web monitoring, brand protection and anti-phishing while specialising in protection against data and credential leakage, and scam detection, including social media fraud, online scams, and executive Impersonations. It also handles unlimited incident takedowns of detrimental cyber incidents.

CTM360’s Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) capabilities comprise extended guidelines against the latest techniques, tactics, and procedures used by threat actors and ransomware, while its Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) features Security Rating and Analytics to assess the cybersecurity posture and digital health of organisations.

Mirza Asrar Baig, the renowned cybersecurity visionary and CEO of CTM360, expressed his confidence in the partnership with Dialog Enterprise, emphasising on CTM360’s expertise in the DRPS, EASM, and CTI domains. Reflecting upon CTM360’s continuous learning journey, Baig highlighted the importance of agility and adaptability as the basis of defense in cybersecurity.

Dialog Enterprise Group Chief Officer Navin Pieris said: “An effective DRP is capable of mapping the attack surface assessing its potential threats, constantly monitoring all surfaces by gathering cyber threat intelligence from multiple sources, and mitigating threats scaled across the organisation, effectively managing the threat data flows with DRP workflows, all the while ensuring the smooth functioning of the organization’s most critical services.”

“In that context, we have just been boosted with a headstart in cybersecurity for our enterprise expeditions with the privilege of CTM360 partnering with us,” he added.

In testament to CTM360’s capabilities, the company has been acknowledged by Forrester in 2018 in The Forrester New Wave Report - Digital Risk Protection, by Gartner for Critical Insights in Digital Risk Protection Services in 2020, and 2022, CTM360 received the Frost & Sullivan Global Risk Protection Enabling Technology Leadership award, further solidifying its position as a key player in the cybersecurity arena.

CTM360 operates as a fully managed technology platform in the cloud, strategically positioned outside an organisation’s traditional perimeter. The web-based portal is designed to offer role-based analytics and configurable dashboards, providing a practical tool for managerial decision-making. CEOs, COOs, and members of the Board can have a real-time, simplified view of the organisation’s Cybersecurity Posture, while more technical savvy roles like CIOs and CISOs can have a more detailed real-time snapshot of the organisation’s Digital Health. These simplified dashboards facilitate C-level decision makers to effectively focus on what is important, aiding in the reinforcement of cybersecurity measures.

The platform’s appeal lies in its function as a turn-key solution, coupled with 24/7 expert support. Notably, CTM360’s risk protection platform takes a unique approach by consolidating various external security verticals into a single
