A taste of LunuDehi…in Negombo

Having just completed a highly successful tour of Canada and the States, with BnS, Umaria and Randhir, the band LunuDehi is, once again, ready to do the needful, back home.

They say they are all geared up for the big event on Friday, 26th April, presented by the Past Pupils’ Association of Ave Maria Convent, Negombo.

‘Twinkling Blues 2024’ will be held at the Jetwing Blue, Negombo, and, in addition to LunuDehi, JAYASRI will also be in attendance, along with DJ Nuwan.

‘Twinkling Blues 2024’ is a dancing night, they say, and will move into action from 7.30 pm onwards.

Since it’s a special event, the dress code is black and gold.

For more information, you could call either Chrishani (0777465912) or Neeliya (0773014411).
