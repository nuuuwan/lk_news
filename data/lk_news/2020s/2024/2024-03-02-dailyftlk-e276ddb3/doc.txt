Govt. to lower Special Commodity Tax on dates for Ramadan

State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya says levy to be slashed from Rs. 200 per kilo to Rs. 1

State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya yesterday announced that the Special Commodity Tax on dates imported for Ramadan will be reduced within the next couple of days.

The move aims to alleviate the financial burden on consumers during the religiously significant period.

“At present, a Special Commodity Tax of Rs. 200 per kilo is levied on imported dates. This will be slashed to Rs. 1 per kilo providing substantial relief to the consumers,” he added.

Siyambalapitiya said to avail this tax reduction, the importers must obtain prior permission from the Religious Affairs Ministry Secretary. “The requirement will ensure the tax relief is targeted specifically towards goods intended for Ramadan observances,” he stressed.
