Prime Minister goes to Jaffna; applauds farmers

Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday attended the Jaffna District Coordinating Committee meeting held at the Jaffna Divisional Secretariat Office.

He also participated in the distribution of rice and egg incubators for the low income families.

In his address, the Prime Minister said farmers are not Government workers, and their service and contribution are immeasurable.

“The Government is dedicated to improving the living conditions of the Jaffna Peninsula. In order to increase the living conditions, we have embarked on an increase in most of the expenditure needed by the departments, and also special allocations for rural and urban development in the Local Government area. The President and the Government are committed to improve the services and living conditions, therefore, to provide the necessary infrastructure for developments, which means much to your area,” said the Prime Minister.

“We appreciate the immeasurable efforts of farmers because farmers are all in the private sector. Let us not forget, farmers are all in the private sector, either in the ownership or in the tenancy. They are private contributors to the national development of the economy,” he added.

Fisheries Minister Douglas Devanada, Northern Province Governor P.S.M. Charles, MPs M.A. Sumanthiran, Angajan Ramanathan, C. Vigneshwaran, Dharmalingam Siddharthan, Yadamini Gunawardena, Public Administration Ministry Secretary Pradeep Yasaratne, District Secretary Ambalawanar Sivabalasundaran also attended the event.
