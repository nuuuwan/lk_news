CID arrests self-proclaimed ‘Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva’

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has arrested Mahinda Kodituwakku, the self-proclaimed ‘Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva’ at Pannipitiya a short while ago.

Kodituwakku is accused of committing irreligious activities that are contrary to Buddhist teachings.

On Friday (12), the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court also imposed an overseas travel ban on him.

Earlier this week, the president of Buddhist Information Centre, Ven. Agulugalle Sri Jinananda Thero had filed a complaint with the CID alleging that Kodituwakku has been misleading the Buddhist community.
