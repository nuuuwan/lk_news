Sri Lanka condemns attack on Iranian Consulate in Damascus

Sri Lanka yesterday condemned the attack on the Iranian Consulate in Damascus and called for strict adherence to Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic Relations, especially with regard to protection of personnel and premises of diplomatic missions.

“Sri Lanka wishes to urge all parties concerned to exercise restraint, refrain from use of violence, and not to exacerbate the already volatile security situation in the region,” Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement.

“Sri Lanka conveys its sincere condolences to the bereaved families due to the attack and the Government and the people of the Islamic Republic of Iran,” it added.

Foreign media quoted the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor as saying 16 people were killed in the consulate strike: eight Iranians, five Syrians, one member of Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group and two civilians. Among the dead were generals Mohammad Reza Zahedi and Mohammad Hadi Haji Rahimi, both senior commanders in the Quds Force, the IRGC’s foreign operations arm.
