Collaborative efforts mooted for success of “Pekoe Trail” project to boost tourism

A review meeting was conducted on Friday (Jan.19) at the President’s Office, chaired by Sagala Ratnayaka, Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff, to discuss the progress of the “Pekoe trail” project aimed at boosting Sri Lanka’s tourism industry.

The Pekoe trail team has outlined its plans for the project, emphasizing the creation of a tourist trail that has garnered global popularity and is poised to significantly support the development of the tea industry in Sri Lanka.

Pekoe Trail is a 300-kilometer curated long-distance walking trail through the Central Highlands of the island.

Highlighting the potential to attract tourists who haven’t previously considered visiting Sri Lanka, the team expressed the importance of the project in expanding the country’s appeal as a tourist destination.

Ratnayaka, in his remarks, underscored President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s keen interest in the project, deeming it a crucial initiative for Sri Lanka.

He called for a collaborative effort to address legal and other challenges that have arisen during the project’s implementation. He specifically advised officials to engage with representatives from local estate companies and relevant line agencies to swiftly resolve issues and ensure the success of the Pekoe trail project.
