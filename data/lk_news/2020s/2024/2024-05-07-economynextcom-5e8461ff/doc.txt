Sri Lanka EPF net contribution turn positive again in 2024: Deputy Governor

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Employment Provident Fund contributions had turned positive in 2024, after outflows exceeded inflows in 2023, Deputy Governor Yvette Fernando said.

“In 2023 there were greater outflows,” Fernando explained. “Sometime people who retired did not immediately take out their funds. But there were more outflows last year.

In 2024 some private firms have raised salaries after inflation spiked last year. Some companies have also raised executive salaries to defray an income tax hike.

Demographers have been warning for years that EPF contributions would eventually turn negative, though the original deadline had passed. (Colombo/May07/2024)
