World interest grows in nuke power generation in Sri Lanka

In the backdrop of the government evolving legislation to regulate nuclear power generation and the Sri Lanka Atomic Energy Board (SLAEB) getting ready to call for Expression of Interest from prospective investors, a delegation of China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) is expected in the country soon to explore investment in a nuke plant in the country, an official said yesterday.

CNNC is among the organizations that submitted proposals for such a plant in the country. Besides Russia’s Rosatom, France’s Électricité de France (EDF), and Denmark’s Seaborg have submitted proposals.

In its plan for reduction of carbon emission, the government has decided to have nuclear power in its energy mix. Recently, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team of experts also concluded a seven-day safety review of Sri Lanka’s selection process to identify potential sites to build its first nuclear power plant.

Commenting on the latest progress, SLAEB Prof. S. R. D. Rosa said a team of legal experts were to leave Sri Lanka for Vienna, Austria yesterday to engage with the IAEA for the evolution of the proposed law in Sri Lanka to regulate nuclear power generation.

“We have to amend the current law. In parallel, we are getting ready to call for Expressions of Interest from prospective investors. We cannot expect nuclear power cost to be lower than hydropower. Still, it will be somewhere between the costs of thermal power and hydropower,” he said.

Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation of the US (USNC) and Canada’s Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd (AECL) are among others interested in investing in Sri Lanka.

Earlier, Russia’s Rosatom submitted proposals. Russia operated two nuclear power plants in Bangladesh and in Kudankulam, India, which is only about 207 kilometres from Kalpitiya
