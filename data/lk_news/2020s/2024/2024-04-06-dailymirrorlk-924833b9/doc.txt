Sri Lankan gold smuggling attempt foiled near Vedhalai Coast

Colombo, April 6 (Daily Mirror) - In a coordinated effort between the Indian Coast Guard (ICG), Customs Preventive Unit (CPU) Ramanathapuram, and the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), a gold smuggling operation originating from Sri Lanka was intercepted near the Vedhalai coast in Mandapam, Tamil Nadu.

The DRI had received specific intelligence indicating the smuggling of foreign-origin gold into India via the Vedhalai coast, orchestrated by a criminal group using fishing boats. Surveillance was intensified by DRI and ICG personnel in the Vedhalai Coastal area on the night of April 3-4. In the early hours of April 4, a suspicious boat was identified at mid-sea and pursued by an ICG vessel until interception.

During the chase, a consignment of foreign-origin gold was thrown into the sea by one of the individuals onboard the suspect boat. Three individuals were apprehended onboard, and upon interrogation, they confessed to smuggling the gold from Sri Lanka, receiving it from a boat at deep sea.

The Customs Preventive Unit of Ramanathapuram also joined the operation, securing the location where the gold was discarded. After an extensive search, the smuggled gold weighing 4.9 Kg and valued at Rs 3.43 Crore was recovered from the sea bed on April 5. The gold, packed in crude bars of varying sizes and concealed in a towel, was thrown into the sea to evade detection.

The DRI has seized the smuggled gold, and all three individuals are undergoing interrogation as the investigation unfolds.
