Governemntâ€™s poor management creates issues for consumers

Colombo, March 16 (Daily Mirror) - 'World Consumer Rights Day' is relevant to countries like Sri Lanka, where there are no policies or rights for consumers, presidential candidate Janaka Ratnayake said.

Addressing the media, he said Consumer Rights Day was declared to protect the rights of consumers around the world.

"But in Sri Lanka, there is no such rights for consumers. The country cannot manage the prices of fuel, electricity, water and other essential commodities and goods," he said.

"We are living in a country with poor management. The current government cannot manage even the price of an egg in the local market. Every week, there will be a topic to be discussed regarding essential commodities. During the past few weeks, discussions have been held on egg prices; during the last week, it was about big onions. I cannot imagine what will be the topic next week," Ratnayake said.

"The issue is with the government, not with consumers. There is no policy to protect consumers, and therefore, bogus traders and sellers use these opportunities to increase their wealth.

"All these issues have arisen not because of the shortage of consumer goods but due to the poor management of the Minister and other responsible senior officials," he said.

"Therefore, the time has come to gather people to protect their consumer rights; otherwise, the people will have to starve," Ratnayake said.
