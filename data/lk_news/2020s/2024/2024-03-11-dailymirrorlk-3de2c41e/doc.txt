SLPP expresses concerns over Presidentâ€™s direct dealing with individual MPs

Colombo, March 11 (Daily Mirror)- Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is reported to have reiterated its concerns with President Ranil Wickremesinghe over his direct dealings with individuals of the party bypassing its hierarchy.

It was communicated to the President when he met with SLPP leaders Mahinda Rajapaksa and Basil Rajapaksa last week.

Such concerns were reiterated in the wake up of some MPs and electoral organizers siding with the President.

Currently, a sediment of SLPP MPs remain loyal to the President. Most of them hold ministerial positions in the government. SLPP MP Chief Government Whip Prasanna Ranatunga openly advocates candidacy to the President at the upcoming presidential election. However, the SLPP is yet to take any formal decision although all indications point to its support to the President.

The SLPP raised similar concerns on a previous occasion too in this regard
