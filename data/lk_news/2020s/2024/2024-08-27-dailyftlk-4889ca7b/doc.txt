Australia’s United Petroleum top officials meet President to discuss expansion plans

Australian energy giant, United Petroleum’s senior leadership team, including Co-Founder Avi Silver, Group CFO Nigel Simonsz, Group Procurement Head Brett Crawford and United Petroleum Lanka Director/CEO Dr. Prabath Samarasinghe, met with President Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday to discuss the company’s operations and future plans in Sri Lanka.

The meeting, which was also attended by BOI Chairman Dinesh Weerakkody, comes as United Petroleum launches its first international retail operations outside Australia.

The Australian energy giant hosted a distributor felicitation event in Colombo last week, signalling its intent to expand its lubricant range and introduce a convenience store concept at its gas stations.

Starting from 28 August, United Petroleum will begin operations with 150 filling stations and plans to establish 50 additional fuel stations, representing an investment of over $ 100 million to bolster its market presence.
