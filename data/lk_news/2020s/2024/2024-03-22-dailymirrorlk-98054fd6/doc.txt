General elections must be held first to maintain fairness: MR

Colombo, March 12 (Daily Mirror) - Leader of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), Mahinda Rajapaksa, said that a general election should be held first and then the presidential election to maintain a fair process in the country.

Addressing the media, Rajapaksa said that Basil Rajapaksa had conveyed this proposal to President Ranil Wickremesinghe on behalf of the SLPP when Basil met the President recently.

Mahinda Rajapaksa also maintained that if this proposal is not followed, whichever party wins the presidential election will have a massive victory in the parliamentary election, which is not good for the country.

He also said that there should be a fair situation in the country after the elections.
