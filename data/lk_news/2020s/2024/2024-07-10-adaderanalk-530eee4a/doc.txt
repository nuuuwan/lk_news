NTC to be given authority to regulate three-wheelers

The Minister of Transport and Highways, Bandula Gunawardana says that the clearance of the Attorney General has been received for the draft bill to amend the National Transport Commission Act.

During the parliamentary session today (10), the minister stated that even though the National Transport Commission can intervene only with regard to bus fares, the act has been amended to also allow the regulation of school vans, three-wheelers and other passenger transport vehicles as well.

He further emphasized that they acknowledge that three-wheelers provide a significant public service and that effective regulation is needed in that regard.

“However, as we do not have the necessary authority to do that, I have amended the National Transport Commission Act.” He stated that the clearance of the Attorney General’s Department has been received, marking a crucial step towards addressing the existing situation.

Accordingly, he further mentioned that the draft bill will be submitted to the Cabinet for approval and then gazetted before being presented to the Parliament.

Through this, he stated that it will be possible to install taxi meters in three-wheelers and for them to issue receipts upon customer’s request.
