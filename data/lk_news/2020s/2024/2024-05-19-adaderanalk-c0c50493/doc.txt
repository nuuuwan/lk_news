AKD says debate with Sajith is off if no confirmation before deadline

Leader of the National Peoples’ Power (NPP) Anura Kumara Dissanayake states that an NPP government will abolish all special privileges of the Heads of the State including pensions, allowances, official residences, vehicles etc.

Addressing an event held in Maharagama today (19), the NPP leader also pledged to provide a ‘sufficient pension’ for the retired community, which he elaborated is an amount sufficient for the cost of living. Meanwhile, the NPP leader assured that the interest rates for the savings of senior citizens will be increased up to 15%.

Speaking further during the event, Dissanayake said that since the deadline given for the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) to confirm a date for the proposed debate on the policies of both parties on economic issues ends tomorrow (May 20), it will be considered as a rejection of the debate.

“They requested a debate, and we gave them four days before May 15. He said he was busy all those four days. We then asked him to suggest any possible date before May 20. Tomorrow is the last day before the 20th… If they don’t come before the 20th; we will consider it a NO”, he added.

In the meantime, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has suggested dates for holding the proposed debate on economic policies with the NPP.

In a letter dated May 17, 2024, the SJB informed the NPP that the debate between the economic committees of both parties could be held on one of the dates between May 27 to 31 and the debate between the two leaders of both parties on June 03, 04, 05, 06 or 07. The letter has also requested for an immediate response from the NPP in this regard.
