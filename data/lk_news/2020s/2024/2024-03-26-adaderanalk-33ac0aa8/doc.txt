Investigation ordered into ‘assassination attempt’ on Magistrate Thilina Gamage

Public Security Minister Tiran Alles has ordered an immediate investigation into an assassination attempt on Colombo Fort Magistrate Thilina Gamage.

Accordingly, Inspector General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon has been instructed to initiate an investigation into an attempt by a gunman to assassinate the magistrate using a Type 81 assault rifle grenade launcher.

The investigation was launched based on a tip-off provided in writing by a government informant who revealed that the gunman in question had made phone calls asking around to get his hands on a Type 81 assault rifle to ‘end’ the magistrate’s life over certain verdicts given by him.

The informant has also provided the investigators with the details of the gunman including the contact number.

Upon receiving the tip-off, the minister ordered that an investigation be immediately launched in this regard as such moves could jeopardize the ongoing ‘Yukthiya’ anti-drug operation and the crackdown on the underworld.
