For over eight decades, Chinese Dragon Café has catered to Sri Lankan consumers, offering more than 200 delicious food recipes. From its beginnings as a single restaurant, it has grown into Sri Lanka’s first Chinese cuisine chain, now operating eight outlets across the country, with locations in Bambalapitiya, Mount Lavinia, Rajagiriya, Pelawatta, Wattala, Kandana, Kaduwela, and Nugegoda.
