Hirunika resigns as national organiser of SJB women’s wing

Former MP Hirunika Premachandra states that she is resigning from the post of National Organiser of the ‘Samagi Vanitha Balawegaya’, the women’s organisation of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB).

Premachandra emphasized that despite stepping down from the role, she remains an active member of the party and is determined to contest in the 2024 General Election.

Premachandra attributed her resignation to frustration over accusations from the party that organisers did not fulfill their duties during the presidential election campaign. She noted that these accusations played a significant role in her decision to relinquish her position.

However, Premachandra expressed confidence in her political future, stating her belief that the public will once again elect her to Parliament in the upcoming election.
