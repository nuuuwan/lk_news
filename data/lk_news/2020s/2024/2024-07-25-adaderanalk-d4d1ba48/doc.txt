The government has announced the provision of special leave for government employees who were unable to report to work due to floods, landslides, and road blockages in May and June this year.

This leave applies to officials in the districts of Colombo, Kalutara, Gampaha, Galle, Matara, Hambantota, Puttalam, Kurunegala, Polonnaruwa, Kegalle, and Ratnapura.

Government employees who had faced disruptions in public transport services or were directly affected by natural disasters, resulting in displacement, will be eligible for this special leave.

The circular regarding this leave was issued by the Secretary of the Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils, and Local Government Pradeep Yasaratne.

Additionally, the government has approved an allowance of Rs. 3,000 for retired government employees starting next September.

This decision was approved during the cabinet meeting held on July 24, 2024.

Minister of Education Susil Premajayantha stated that this allowance will be provided to pensioners until the existing salary discrepancies are resolved.
