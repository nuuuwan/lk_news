First phase of 1,500 kms road rehabilitation of starts today

Colombo, Feb 29 (Daily Mirror) - A programme is scheduled to start today as a part of the first phase of the rehabilitation of 1,500 kilometres of roads from Point-Pedro to Dewundara, Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardana said.

Addressing the media, he said the President has allocated sufficient funds from the budget for the rehabilitation of 1,500 kilometres of roads under three phases.

Accordingly, the first phase of the construction of 500 kilometres of roads will commence today. The second phase of the 500 kilometres will commence on March 16 and the third phase of the next 500 kilometres will commence on April 2.

"This programme will be implemented in every District Secretarys' Division in the country. The chairmen of all development committees have specified the roads to be reconstructed," he said.

"As a result of the economic crisis in the country, the maintenance and repair of the whole road system had come to a standstill directly affecting the transport systems and vehicles. The development of the country's infrastructure was based on foreign and local loans and donations. Due to being unable to pay the loan installments, the loans that were promised by countries were rejected. The funds that were to be received from the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank were suspended until the debt restructuring process is completed," he said.

"Until the debt restructuring process is completed, the President has allocated funds from the budget for the rehabilitation of the road system in the country," Minister Gunawardana said.
