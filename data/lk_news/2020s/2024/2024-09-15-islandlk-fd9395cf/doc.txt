CurveUp expands globally, signs key MoU at Collision Conference 2024

CurveUp is expanding its global presence by introducing its innovative educational technologies and methodologies to new international markets, building on its success in South Asia and the Gulf regions. Its sister company, BootUp, is also advancing this mission with the launch of a mobile app that enhances digital, AI, and cybersecurity skills, further supporting CurveUp’s global growth.

During a recent visit to Canada, CurveUp made significant strides by participating in the Collision Conference 2024 in Toronto, a major tech event where the company showcased its solutions and networked with industry leaders. A key achievement from the conference was the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with EduvolutionX, under the supervision of Harman Idema, the Consul General at the Netherlands Consulate General. This agreement marks a pivotal step in developing a cutting-edge STEM curriculum, aiming to enhance global educational innovation.

CurveUp’s Canadian visit included strategic meetings with influential figures, such as Thushara Rodrigo, the Consul General of Sri Lanka in Toronto, which helped solidify the company’s global impact. The team also engaged with Seneca Polytechnic to explore integration opportunities in various technical fields and discussed a financial literacy curriculum with Simple Finance.

Additionally, CurveUp explored educational collaborations with Microsoft Canada and community initiatives like Dunya Habitats’ tinyFARM at the Malvern Family Resource Centre. These engagements are designed to integrate advanced tech solutions and innovative farming models into CurveUp’s educational programs, promoting food security and AGRitech advancements.
