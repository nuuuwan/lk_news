Review decision to reduce consent age for sex: Sajith

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa today urged the government to review its decision to reduce the consent age for sex to 14 when it comes to women.

"There is a strong call from Sri Lankan women to review the government's decision," Premadasa said.

The penal code is to be amended to reduce the consent age for sex to 14 years and to have a single law pertaining to abuse of men and women.
