Heavy showers above 100mm expected in Northern Province

The Department of Meteorology says showers or thundershowers will occur at times in Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern and North-western provinces and in Jaffna, Mannar and Kilinochchi districts.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places in the other areas of the island during the evening or night.

Heavy showers above 100mm are likely at some places in Northern Province, it said, adding that fairly heavy showers above 50mm are likely at some places elsewhere.

The general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
