The first-ever semi-transparent Solar photovoltaic (PV) powered agrivoltaic pilot project of Sri Lanka was commissioned in Hanthana, Kandy on Thursday (Feb.29), marking a significant milestone.

Funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the project aims to pioneer the integration of solar power with agricultural activities.
