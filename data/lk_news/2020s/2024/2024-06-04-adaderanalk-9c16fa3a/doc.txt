SC rules several clauses of ‘Sri Lanka Electricity Bill’ inconsistent with constitution

The Supreme Court has informed that several clauses of the proposed ‘Sri Lanka Electricity Bill’ are inconsistent with the Constitution of Sri Lanka.

The Supreme Court determination states that these clauses shall only be passed by a special majority of Parliament, and that one clause requires approval through a referendum, the Speaker informed the House.

However, the country’s apex court has stated that these clauses could be passed with a simple majority if amended as specified in the Supreme Court’s determination.

The hearing of the petitions challenging the bill commenced on the 9th of May before a three-member Supreme Court bench consisting of Justices Vijith Malalgoda, Shiran Gunaratne, and Arjuna Obeysekera.

Additional Solicitor General Viveka Siriwardena, representing the Attorney General, emphasized that the bill aims to improve the efficiency of electricity generation, distribution, and sale while providing a convenient service to consumers.

Following the submissions, attorneys for the petitioners, including 14 parties such as the secretary of the Ceylon Electricity Workers’ Union, Ranjan Jayalal, presented their arguments.

The Supreme Court has concluded its hearing of the petitions and announced that it will inform its determination to the Speaker of Parliament confidentially on May 13.
