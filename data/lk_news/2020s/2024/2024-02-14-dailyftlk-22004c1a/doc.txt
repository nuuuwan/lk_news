The Government is taking significant strides towards integrating artificial intelligence (AI) education into the school curriculum, with plans for a pilot project supported by Microsoft set to commence from Grade 8 onwards.

The project aims to introduce AI courses in schools where the necessary resources are available, beginning with a revision of the international syllabus currently implemented by Microsoft, in line with recommendations from the National Institute of Education.

The pilot projects are slated to commence from grade 8, with selected schools undergoing digitisation facilitated by Microsoft’s resources. Additionally, Microsoft plans to train 100 Information and Communication Technology (ICT) teachers as trainers to support the implementation of the AI curriculum.

The initiative also aims to leverage AI tools such as ChatGPT and Google Bard to enhance students’ knowledge across various subjects in 2024, with a focus on subjects like Science and Information Technology (IT).

The proposal to this effect jointly submitted by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as Technology Minister, and Education Minister Susil Premajayantha was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers at its meeting on Monday.

“The introduction of AI education into the school curriculum reflects the Government’s efforts to prepare students for the digital age and equip them with essential skills for the future workforce,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

According to the statement comprising Weekly Cabinet Decisions issued by the Government Information Department, the idea for the project was initially proposed last year, following recommendations from a task force appointed to develop a national strategy on AI.

Commending the support of technology partners like Microsoft, he said the Government aims to revolutionise the education sector and ensure that students are well-prepared to thrive in an increasingly AI-driven world.
