Local fruit production to be boosted to meet rising demand

The Ministry of Agriculture yesterday announced ambitious targets to boost fruit production across various categories by 2027, aiming to meet increasing domestic demand and reducing imports.

Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday said this decision follows a study revealing a surge in fruit consumption to 12.8 million metric tons in 2023. He said plans are in place to enhance banana, mango, papaya, pineapple, and passion fruit yields.

According to data from the Department of Agriculture, Sri Lankaâ€™s fruit consumption highlights a growing demand that exceeds current domestic production capabilities. With an annual requirement estimated at 19.6 million metric tons, efforts are underway to bridge this gap through increased agricultural output.

The plan presented by Acting Director General Dr. Kamani Ranatunga to Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries Mahinda Amaraweera, targets specific production goals by 2027. These include raising banana production to 19.5 metric tons per hectare, mango production to 9.5 metric tons, papaya to 45 metric tons, pineapple to 14 metric tons and passion fruit to 30 metric tons.

Ranatunga emphasized that achieving these goals will involve implementing advanced agricultural practices, such as variety and hybrid breeding, high-density cultivation, integrated pest management, enhanced nutrient application and improved production technologies.

Amaraweera underscored the national imperative to cultivate all viable crops locally, especially those currently imported, despite suitable growing conditions within Sri Lanka. He emphasized the economic benefits of reducing foreign exchange expenditure on imported fruits, framing it as a crucial national responsibility.
