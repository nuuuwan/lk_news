Headline Inflation, as measured by the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI), dropped to 0.9 percent in March 2024 from 5.9 percent in February, data from the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) showed.

The CCPI for all items for March 2024 was 196.7, which is a decrease of 3.9 index points compared to February 2024, for which the index was 200.6. The expenditure value decreased by Rs. 3,576 in the ‘Market Basket’.

The contribution of inflation by food commodities was 1.19 percent while the contribution of Non-Food items was -0.32 percent.

As per the data, this to the price decreases in groups of housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, transport, health, clothing and footwear, furnishing household equipment and routine maintenance, as well as the price increases in groups of alcoholic beverages, tobacco and narcotics, education, restaurants and hotels, miscellaneous goods and services, recreation and culture and communication, compared to March 2023.

The Central Bank this week said inflation would stay in line with the 5 percent target for the next 12-18 months.

Compared to previous projections, headline inflation is anticipated to moderate in the forthcoming months, as the effects of the temporary uptick in inflation driven by the VAT amendments are expected to be partly offset by the recent downward revision to the electricity tariff and the moderation in food prices.

Inflation is expected to eventually converge to the targeted level in the period ahead and remain around the target over the medium term, supported by appropriate policy measures, the Central Bank said.

Since last year, the Central bank reduced policy rates by 700 bps in total to help the island nation's economy return to growth.

In September 2022, Sri Lanka saw its inflation reach to the highest level here it expanded to 70 percent due to the severe mismanagement of the economy, resulting in the worst crisis in history.
