Meanwhile , during a separate meeting, Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang has raised concerns about Sri Lanka announcing a moratorium on foreign research vessels in its Exclusive Economic Zone (ECZ) targeting Chinese ships while entertaining a similar vessel from Germany in between.

Mr. Gunawardena has reportedly responded saying Sri Lanka allowed the German vessel only for replenishment . He said Sri Lanka could not decline such requests for replenishment according to the law.

He also said Sri Lanka would not allow any country to use its territory against the interests of any country.
