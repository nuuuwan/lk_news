Cops tender apologies as per Sinhala tradition

Colombo, April 1 (Daily Mirror) - Five policemen have tendered an apology as per Sinhala tradition during a Supreme Court hearing involving the arrest of three individuals over Easter Sunday attacks.

Five policemen including the OIC of Horowpothana and Kebithigollewa Police stations bowed and tendered apologies to three petitioners who were arrested on suspicion of being associates of Zahran Hashim.

Five policemen tendered this apology to three petitioners as a part of the settlement reached between the parties into Fundamental Rights petitions filed by the petitioners challenging their illegal arrest and detention.

The Supreme Court's three-judge-bench comprised Justices S. Thurairaja, Kumuduni Wickremasinghe and Achala Wengappuli.
