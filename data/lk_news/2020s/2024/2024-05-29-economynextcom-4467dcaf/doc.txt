The broader All Share Index closed down 1.03 percent, or 125.76 points, at 12,102; while the S&P SL20 Index closed down 1.99 percent, or 71.95 points, at 3,547.

Commercial Bank, the largest private bank by assets, announced yesterday a capital call from shareholders of 22 billion rupees, offering voting shares at 85 rupees and non-voting at 69 rupees.

The 22.52 billion rupees will used to bolster Tier 1 capital to accommodate future lending, the firm said.

“There was a sharp decline in the market from the bell, mainly due to Commercial Bank. There was significant selling pressure on the bank’s shares which trickled to other banking stocks too,” market participants said.

Commercial is the first bank to make a cash call after bad loans and and a sovereign default dented banks following steep rates cuts made in 2020 to target ‘potential output’ by macro-economists.
