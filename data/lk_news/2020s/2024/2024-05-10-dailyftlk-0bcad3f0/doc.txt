Diana accuses Sajith of orchestrating grand conspiracy against her

Expresses refusal to accept SC ruling due to political conspiracy behind her disqualification

Says SJB’s politics of hatred was evident through their behaviour following SC judgement

Urges women in SL to be cautious of voting for Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa at upcoming polls

Claims she has no intention of leaving SL amidst travel ban imposed by courts yesterday

Embattled former State Minister Diana Gamage yesterday expressed her refusal to accept the recent Supreme Court ruling that disqualified her from Parliament, due to the political conspiracy behind it.

Addressing the media for the first time following the ruling, Gamage levelled accusations against Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leader Sajith Premadasa, SJB General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara, and several others, alleging they had orchestrated political conspiracy against her. She claimed that this plot has led to her disqualification and subsequent loss of her Parliamentary seat.

“I hold the utmost respect for the Courts, but I find myself unable to accept their judgement due to the political machinations orchestrated by the SJB leader and the General Secretary of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB). My critique is not directed at all MPs within the SJB; there are some who maintain integrity and honour,” she said.

The former Minister said the SJB’s politics of hatred was evident in their behaviour yesterday. She declared that an attack on her represents an attack on all women in the nation.

“I fearlessly voiced the truth and advocated for the women of our country. The Opposition leader and a select few collaborated to initiate this case, relentlessly striving to remove me. This has been a four-year battle,” she declared.

“The politics of hatred has prevailed, at least for now,” she lamented. She urged the women of Sri Lanka to exercise caution when casting their votes for the Opposition leader in the upcoming polls.

Despite her absence from Parliament, Gamage pledged to persist in her fight for all women in the country, assuring that the truth will eventually come to light for the people. She revealed ongoing discussions with her legal representatives, expressing willingness to pursue an appeal if feasible. Additionally, she confirmed the return of all Government property and her resignation from the ministerial position.

Following her disqualification from Parliament, Gamage faced further setbacks as the Colombo Magistrate’s Court imposed an overseas travel ban on her yesterday.

Colombo Magistrate Thilina Gamage issued this directive after considering a request presented by the Counsels representing the petitioning party involved in the case concerning her dual citizenship.

Copies of the order were also forwarded to the offices of the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration, as well as the Director of National Intelligence.

In response, Gamage asserted that she has no intentions of leaving the country. “Why should I leave the country? This is my homeland; I was born here, and my family has deep roots in the South, spanning generations,” she affirmed.
