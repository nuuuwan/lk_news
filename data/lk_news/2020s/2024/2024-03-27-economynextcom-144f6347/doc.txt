India to facilitate digital public infrastructure for Sri Lanka

ECONOMYNEXT – India will help expedite a digital public infrastructure for Sri Lanka, Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Santosh Jha has said.

“It is a set of shared digital systems that are secure and interoperable, built on open technologies to deliver equitable access to public and or private services at a societal scale,” Jha said at the Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) Seminar on Tuesday, at Taj Samudra Hotel, Colombo.

The seminar was co-organized by the High Commission of India in Colombo and the Ministry of Technology, Government of Sri Lanka, to explore the transformative potential of DPI for enabling service delivery, empowering communities by fostering inclusivity and enriching the economy by driving innovation.

“Both our leaders agreed to leverage India’s DPI in accordance with Sri Lanka’s requirements and priorities towards effective and efficient delivery of citizen-centric services to the people of Sri Lanka.

“We strongly believe that as in the case of India, this is the beginning of the digital magic for Sri Lanka.

“We have already rolled out the UPI (Unified Payments Interface) in Sri Lanka last month and we are now working with the government of Sri Lanka to roll out the unique digital identity Project based on MOSIP architecture.”

India’s Modular Open Source Identity Platform (MOSIP), developed using open source software, has been used to implement foundational digital identity systems for other countries seeking them, its website says.

The ongoing roll out of the India-funded digital identity project has been facing delays in implementation, after bidders for the tender to print the identity cards were disqualified earlier this year by the Sri Lankan government.

The project that is to commence with 450 million Indian rupees from India, will collect biographic and biometric information, including facial, iris, and fingerprint data for building a public digital identification system.

In January, Public Security Minister Tiran Alles said that there were concerns over data privacy in the project.

Alles has said the Indian project has the risk of a data privacy breach, and that he would not want data of Sri Lankan citizens “to go out to any other country”.

The government called for tenders with local partners and four foreign manufactures for a separate electronic National Identity Card (e-NIC) project, run by the Department of Personal Registration, also coming under the purview of Alles.

The Indian project is expected to store personal data of individuals in a centralised system to issue identification cards as per the standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), government officials have said, for efficient delivery of government services, financial inclusion, and poverty reduction.
