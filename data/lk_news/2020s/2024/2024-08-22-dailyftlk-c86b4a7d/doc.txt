Paranawithana to replace Thalatha in Parliament

Eksath Janaraja Peramuna Politburo Chairperson Karunarathna Paranawithana is expected to replace outgoing Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Thalatha Athukorala in Parliament.

Karunarathna Paranawithana contested from the Ratnapura District under the SJB ticket in the 2020 Parliamentary elections but did not secure a seat, receiving 42,314 preferential votes.
