Export-oriented firm originating from Jaffna launches historic IPO

Also the first listing under USAID Private Sector Development Programme

With the large number of companies listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) across multiple sectors which are operating on different business models, deciding where to invest one’s money can be overwhelming.Most ‘growth investors’ determine a stock’s potential over the long run; nevertheless they want to catch the stock on an upswing instead of hoping for one in the future.

In this context, the Initial Public Offering (IPO) by Maharaja Foods Ltd which will open on 4th July 2024 may be in alignment with the strategy of many first time investors as well as portfolio investors. It could be an opportunity for them to pursue growth by taking a path of less volatility and more predictability because it involves a food manufacturing business that is least affected by inflation.

This is especially so when one looks closely at the range of food products they manufacture and their network of distributors in Sri Lanka, France, United Kingdom and Australia. Notably, 64% of export income the company earned in FY 23/24 surpassed USD 1mn. The IPO aims to raise Rs. 125mn by offering 20% stake, i.e., 25 million shares at Rs. 5/= per share.

The founders originate from the Northern Province and arguably the first-ever northern family company led by a woman entrepreneur to be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange perhaps becoming a guiding light for other businesses in the North to follow suit.

Founded by late Sivasaraman Guganathan hailing from Velani -Jaffna, Maharaja Food Products Ltd (MFPL) brand was launched in 1995, sourcing premium quality food items such as rice, potatoes, onions, lentils etc empowering local farmers whilst providing high quality food products to its customers. Today, the company stands as a symbol of quality and innovation, enriching lives with a diverse array of products including rice-based and flour-based products, spices, fish-based products, and a range of grocery items, serving both local and overseas consumers through its network of distributors in Sri Lanka in afore mentioned global markets.

Furthermore, Maharaja Food Products will be the first CSE listing under the USAID CATALYZE Sri Lanka Private Sector Development (PSD) Activity’s Funding Readiness Program, aimed at facilitating equity capital for SMEs through CSE listings and private investors.

Vijayananth Guganathan, Chairman / Non-Independent Executive Director stated that while MFPL has 5000+ local distribution channels, it predominantly focuses on exports, with 64% of income earned in FY 23/24 surpassing USD 1mn, hence raising fresh equity capital to finance business expansion and growth.

“We will use majority of IPO funds to set up a raw rice plant and a rice polishing plant, setup a Gingelly oil plant, expand the building premises to Increase warehousing capacity, and secure additional working capital,” he said.

Atarah Capital will act as the Financial Advisor & Manager to the Offer and Sponsor of the IPO. “We are delighted on our efforts to introduce a company with founders originating from the Northern Province to be listed on the CSE. Furthermore, MFPL is a woman-owned enterprise, hence the listing would encourage women entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka, and inspire others to consider listing as an attractive option to raising equity capital, stated Rohan Senewiratne Managing Director Atarah Capital.

MFPE Board of Directors are; Vijayananth Guganathan (Chairman / Non-Independent Executive Director), Vithyanath Guganathan (Managing Director / Non-Independent Executive Director), Thavamalar Guganathan (Non-Independent Executive Director), Seyed Rizvi Mowlana (Independent Executive Director), Melanga A Doolwala (Independent Non-Executive Director) and Imran Furkan (Independent Non-Executive Director)
