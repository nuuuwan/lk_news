‘Sarvajana Balaya’ stage protest against proposed ‘Sri Lanka Electricity Bill’

The seven political parties representing the “Sarvajana Balaya” alliance, including the National Freedom Front (NFF), Mawbima Janatha Party (MJP), Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU), the Communist Party of Sri Lanka, ‘Yuthukama’ organisation and the Independent MP’s Forum engaged in a peaceful protest today (05) near the Parliament Roundabout against the proposed ‘Sri Lanka Electricity Bill’.

National Organizer of National Freedom Front (NFF) Jayantha Samaraweera, leader of the Mawbima Janatha Party (MJP) entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera, leader of the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) MP Udaya Gammanpila, the General Secretary of the Communist Party, Dr G. Weerasinghe, President of the ‘Yuthukama’ national organization, Gevindu Kumaratunga and Prof. Channa Jayasumana from the Independent MP’s Forum joined this protest.

Speaking to reporters during the protest, the leaders of the “Sarvajana Balaya” claim that the proposed bill abolishes the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and has made provisions to purchase electricity from foreign countries, which enables the integration of Sri Lanka’s energy system with India’s energy system.

They also alleged that under such circumstances, Sri Lanka’s energy system would be under the control of India.

He charged that this could even lead to threats to Sri Lanka’s national security due to the fact that the bill proposes to do away with existing provisions that have been put in place to safeguard the country’s energy security and privatize the entire sector.
