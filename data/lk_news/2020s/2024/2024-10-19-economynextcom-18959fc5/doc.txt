ECONOMYNEXT – The Government of India has formally doubled their grant support for upgrading 9 schools in the plantation sector, at a total of cost of 600 million rupees, former minister Jeevan Thondaman said.

“Glad to announce that the Government of India has formally doubled their grant support for upgrading 9 schools in the plantation sector – a total of Rs. 600 million,” Thondaman said on X.

Once the school projects are completed, they will make a transformative impact on the lives of the students in the plantation sector, Thondaman said.
