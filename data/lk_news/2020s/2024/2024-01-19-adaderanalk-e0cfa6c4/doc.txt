15 CEB workers interdicted for obstructing services during recent protest

A total of 15 employees of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) have been interdicted for disrupting the services during their protest against the proposed restructuring of the state-owned electricity supplier.

CEB trade union members engaged in a series of protests since January 03, against the governmentâ€™s Bill to restructure the electricity board.

According to the CEB, these clerical staff members in charge of the cash counters had obstructed the customers, who had come to pay their bills, by closing the windows of the counters.
