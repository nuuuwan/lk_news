Foreign Affairs Ministry says BRICS membership still pending

The Foreign Affairs Ministry yesterday insisted pending requests for BRICS membership from many countries, including Sri Lanka, will be considered by BRICS member countries in due course.

It was responding to media reports which claimed “rejection” of Sri Lanka’s membership application to BRICS. The Foreign Ministry noted such reports were incorrect and misleading.

As approved by the Cabinet on 7 October 2024, Sri Lanka applied for membership in BRICS and the new development bank (NDB). Foreign Affairs Minister Vijitha Herath wrote to his counterparts in BRICS member countries informing of Sri Lanka’s interest to join. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake also wrote to his Russian counterpart in this regard.

At the BRICS Outreach Summit held in Kazan, Russia from 22-24 October 2024, Foreign Secretary Aruni Wijewardane, as leader of the Sri Lanka delegation, announced Sri Lanka’s interest. At the Summit, the BRICS Member States also endorsed a new category of Partner Countries, whilst ‘welcoming the considerable interest by countries of the Global South in BRICS’ (Kazan Declaration).

Pending requests for BRICS membership from many countries, including Sri Lanka, will be considered by BRICS member countries in due course.

Sri Lanka’s intention to join the NDB was welcomed by the President of the NDB. The Foreign Ministry, together with relevant Government agencies, will review the procedures and timing in this regard.

There is no truth in the statement carried in certain local media that “Sri Lanka’s BRICS application has been rejected.”

It is regrettable that the points made by the Foreign Affairs Minister at the post-Cabinet media conference on 6 November 2024 have been misrepresented.
