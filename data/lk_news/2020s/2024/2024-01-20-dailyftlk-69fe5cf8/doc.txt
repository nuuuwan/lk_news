EDB, universities and associations join forces to strengthen ornamental fish industry, boost exports

A collaborative effort led by the Export Development Board (EDB) alongside Sri Lankan universities, the Tropical Ornamental Fish Association and Sri Lanka Ornamental Fish Farmersâ€™ Association organised a one-day workshop on 11 January.

The key objective of the workshop was to help improve the export potential of ornamental fish, support grassroots development, and enhance the abilities of exporters.

The initial stage of the workshop is directed at esteemed universities such as Uwa Wellassa University in Passara, University of Ruhuna in Matara, Rajarata University in Anuradhapura, and University of Wayamba in Kurunegala.

The day-long program has covered several essential topics, discussing selected research findings. Areas of focus include live feed production, Best Management Practices (BMPs), high-density packaging, aquatic plants, aquascaping and insights into export procedures.

Sri Lanka has gained recognition in the global market for exporting top-quality tank-bred fish and wild-caught marine species. In 2022, the Sri Lankan ornamental fish industry achieved impressive annual export revenue of $ 22 million.

While 70% of the overall production comprises freshwater fish species, there exists substantial room for further growth. Expanding production and enhancing quality standards are crucial to meet the current global market demands and standards.

The ornamental fish industry comprises various stakeholders, including fish breeders, farmers, out-growers, middlemen, collectors, and exporters from different parts of the island. However, operating within a highly unpredictable business environment poses continuous challenges.

The major hurdles often encountered involve a lack of initial knowledge, lower production quality, and insufficient fish feed supplies. Overcoming these challenges is vital, as it aimed to provide the necessary support to these stakeholders, enabling them to enter and thrive in the competitive international market.
