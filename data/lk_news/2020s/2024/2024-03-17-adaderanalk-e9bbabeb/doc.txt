Schools asked to postpone sports meets due to hot weather

Minister of Education Susil Premajayantha says that school principals will be informed through a circular to organise the inter-house sports meets and sports events of their respective schools after the Sinhala and Tamil New Year holidays.

The minister pointed out that it has been observed that many schools have organised inter-house sports meets regardless of the prevailing hot weather conditions across the island.

Minister Susil Premajayantha said that since the first school term will continue even after the New Year holidays, it is possible to hold sports meets and other outdoor sporting events during that period.

Meanwhile, the Department of Meteorology says the heat index, the temperature felt on the human body, is expected to increase up to ‘Caution level’ at some places in North-western, North-central, Eastern, Western provinces and Monaragala, Mannar, Rathnapura and Vavuniya districts tomorrow (18).
