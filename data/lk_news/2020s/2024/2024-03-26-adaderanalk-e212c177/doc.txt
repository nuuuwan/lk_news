Chinese premier holds talks with Sri Lankan PM; explore cooperation in clean energy and telecom

Chinese Premier Li Qiang held talks with Sri Lankan Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena on Tuesday in Beijing.

Li said China and Sri Lanka are strategic partners of cooperation characterized by sincere mutual assistance and enduring friendship spanning generations. The two countries have always respected each other and enjoyed equality and reciprocal cooperation since the establishment of diplomatic relations 67 years ago, he added.

China is ready to work with Sri Lanka to implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state during their talks last year, carry forward the tradition of friendship, consolidate political mutual trust, and expand bilateral cooperation in various fields to promote common development, Li noted.

China supports Sri Lanka’s efforts to realize national unity and stability as well as independent economic development, Li said, adding that China is willing to push forward the implementation of major projects under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative and deepen bilateral cooperation in trade, agriculture and marine research.

He called on the two sides to explore cooperation potential in clean energy and telecommunication while strengthening exchanges and cooperation in culture, tourism and education.

China encourages more companies to invest in Sri Lanka and is willing to increase imports of Sri Lankan quality products, Li said, expressing the hope that Sri Lanka could provide a good business environment for Chinese companies.

Gunawardena thanked China for providing long-term support to Sri Lanka’s efforts to safeguard national sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and helping the country realize economic and social development and cope with the COVID-19 pandemic and financial crisis.

Hailing the Belt and Road Initiative and global initiatives proposed by China, he said that Sri Lanka has always adhered to the one-China principle and will continue to firmly pursue policies to strengthen friendly cooperation with China.

Sri Lanka will work with China to solidly advance the Belt and Road cooperation, deepen cooperation in various fields, and further cultural exchanges and engagement between the two peoples, to promote the common development of the two countries and regional peace and stability, Gunawardena said.

Li and Gunawardena witnessed the signing of a batch of deals in areas such as trade, investment, customs and development cooperation after their talks at the Great Hall of the People.

At the invitation of the Chinese premier, Gunawardena is on an official visit to China from March 25 to 30.
