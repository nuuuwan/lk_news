Rs 20 billion needed for presidential and general election

Colombo, Feb. 12 (Daily Mirror)- A total sum of Rs 20 billion is needed for the presidential and general elections, Director General Election commission Saman Sri Ratnayake said.

Ratnayake told journalists that he had already informed this matter to Parliament and to the finance ministry.

The Presidential election is due this year while the term of the present Parliament would end in 2025. However there are constitutional provisions for the President to dissolve Parliament anytime after it completes four and a half years of its term as per the 21st amendment to the constitution.

The government had pledged that the presidential election would be held this year while the opposition had alleged that there is a sinister move to abolish the Executive presidency without holding the presidential poll.
