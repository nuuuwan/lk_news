CB officials to be summoned before Parliament for declaring independence

Parliament, May 07 (Daily Mirror)- Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) officials are to be summoned before Parliament for declaring itself as an independent institution, it was revealed in Parliament today.

Leader of the House Susil Premajayantha said the Speaker can summon CBSL officials either before the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) or the Committee on Public Finance (COPF) to seek an explanation.

He said this in response to an issue raised by MP Charitha Herath who said the CBSL has identified itself as an independent entity in its annual report 2023.

"No Committee in the House has questioned the CBSL officials on this issue," he said.

MP Wimal Weerawansa said the CBSL has no say on the funds it holds as all funds belong to the government.
