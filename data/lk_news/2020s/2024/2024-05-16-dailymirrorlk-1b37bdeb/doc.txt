Prasanna Ranaweera assaults porter at BIA

Colombo, May 16 (Daily Mirror) - State Minister of Small and Medium Enterprises Development, Prasanna Ranaweera, has been accused of assaulting a porter at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA).

The altercation occurred as the minister accompanied his wife, who was scheduled to travel overseas today.

Sources told Daily Mirror that that the minister, along with his armed security personnel, attempted to enter the airport through the main entrance.

However, airport security officers intervened, informing the minister that his security detail could not bring firearms into the airport. This prompted an alleged verbal outburst from Ranaweera, who reportedly threatened several security officers.

The situation escalated when a porter assisting with the luggage of the minister's wife was allegedly assaulted. Witnesses claim the conflict arose after the porter objected to receiving only Rs. 750 instead of the standard Rs. 1,000 fee clearly posted at the airport.

In response, Ranaweera is said to have slapped the porter in the face before leaving the premises.
