Power and Energy Minister expresses gratitude to Iran for Uma Oya multi-purpose project

Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera yesterday said he met with the construction and engineering partner of the Uma Oya Multipurpose facility, FARAB Group top officials and the Iranian Energy Ministry officials on Monday at the Ministry premises.

“A meeting with the Managing Director, Chairman of the Board, officials of FARAB group and officials of the Iranian Ministry of Energy was held yesterday (Monday). I thanked the officials for their assistance in implementing the project and discussed possible future investments and partnerships,” he said

With the commissioning of the Uma Oya Hydro Power Plant today (24), the Minister said a total of 120MW power generation capacity will be added to the national grid, reducing the cost of energy. “The project will also provide water requirements for drinking, agricultural and irrigational requirements for beneficiaries in three districts,” he said.

Minister Wijesekera claimed the delays in the construction and commissioning of the hydro power plant due to various politically motivated protests is estimated to be a loss of Rs 9.8 billion per annum to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). The hydro power plant project was scheduled to be commissioned in December 2015.
