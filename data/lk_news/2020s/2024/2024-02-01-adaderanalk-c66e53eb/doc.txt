2023 A/L exam paper-marking gets underway

The Department of Examinations has commenced evaluating the answer scripts of the 2023 G.C.E. Advanced Level Examination.

Accordingly, the paper-marking staff including the chief evaluators will be paid the same amount given to them last year, the Ministry of Education said in a media release published today (Feb.01).

The 2023 G.C.E. Advanced Level Examination was held from January 04 to 31 at more than 2,300 centres, with a total of 346,976 candidates sitting for the highly competitive national test.

It was reported that 281,445 of the candidates were school applicants while the rest of the 65,531 were private applicants.

However, the students are facing the A/L examinationâ€™s Agricultural Science question papers I and II once again today (Feb.01) after the earlier test papers were cancelled and rescheduled. The test held in January was annulled after it was revealed that several questions of both Paper I and II had been leaked.

On January 12, Paper II of the Agricultural Science subject was cancelled, followed by the annulment of Paper I on January 17. This prompted the Department of Examination to announce a fresh date for the Agricultural Science test.

Accordingly, the test was rescheduled for today, with Paper II being held from 8.30 a.m. to 11.40 a.m., and Paper I from 1 p.m. - 3 p.m.
