Gemunu proposes plans to prevent abuses in buses

Colombo, Feb 9 (Daily Mirror) - Before targeting individuals who commit acts of abuse against children and women on public transport, the police must take action to implement the prepaid card system or the transporting of passengers to the seating capacity of buses, the Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) said.

LPBOA chairman Gemunu Wijerathne told the Daily Mirror that people who want to abuse children, women and pickpockets never buy tickets but travel freely.

"Implementing the prepaid card system will help prevent these kinds of abuses. Meanwhile, transporting passengers to the seating capacity of buses will also help reduce these kinds of abuses," he said.

"We have enough private and Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) buses to transport people according to the seating capacities of buses.

"Otherwise, deploying officials or people to apprehend pickpockets and those who abuse women and children will not be a practical solution to the issue," Wijerathne said.
