Batik…back in fashion

Batik shirts, dresses, sarees, handbags, etc., have always had a special place in the fashion scene here.

However, of late, I’ve noticed a new trend in the local fashion scene…with the younger generation making batik outfits their priority.

Probably with the awful heat we are now experiencing, batik dresses are cool and comfortable.

Maneka Liyanage, who is very much in the news these days with her Beauty Tips column in the Thursday Island, which has turned out to be very popular with readers, did a modelling session recently with batik dresses, courtesy of INCHDesigner.

She says she fell in love with the outfits, the moment she saw them, and decided to do a modelling session for readers of The Island.

In addition to her weekly Beauty Tips column, Maneka has also taken the spotlight in Glam Scene and was featured as a fashion model, as well, in the Thursday Island, in November 2023.
