EDEX Mid-Year Expo 2024 kicks off today at BMICH

Celebrating over 20 years of empowering Sri Lanka’s youth, EDEX, the largest and most respected education exhibition and careers fair, is set to host its Mid-Year Expo from 6-8 September at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH), in Colombo.

Building on the success of the main EDEX Expo held earlier this year, the Mid-Year Expo continues to offer a wealth of opportunities for aspiring students and job seekers. This year’s event will feature over 150 education stalls and 25 job fair stalls, including prominent tertiary education, vocational training, and skills development institutes, along with leading corporate entities. Attendees will have access to a diverse range of options in higher education, training, employment, and entrepreneurship.

The Expo will showcase a variety of higher education institutions, both local and international, with representation from countries like Australia, Japan, Canada, Malaysia, and Germany.

EDEX Chairman Mahinda Galagedera emphasised on the timing of the event: “The EDEX Mid-Year Expo is an ideal opportunity for our youth who have just completed their London O/Ls and A/Ls. We encourage those in the higher education sector to maximise on this platform, to support our youth in making informed educational and career decisions.”

He added: “With over two decades of trusted service, EDEX continues to be a vital resource for students and educational institutions alike, providing exposure to both local and international opportunities.”

As usual, the Mid-Year Expo will also host a Job Fair with top Sri Lankan companies offering on-site interviews and immediate recruitment opportunities. EDEX Careers will provide Psychometric Testing to help students and job seekers of all ages find their ideal career paths. Plus, don’t miss out on the Career Seminars, where industry experts will discuss trending topics to help you align your aspirations with today’s job market.

“Our mission at EDEX has always been to open doors to the future for Sri Lankan youth,” said EDEX Expo 2024 Project Chairman Chathushika Nissanka. “We believe that by providing access to quality education, career guidance, and entrepreneurial resources, we are not only building individual success stories but also contributing to the development of a vibrant and competitive workforce for Sri Lanka.”

Canadian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Eric Walsh will ceremoniously open the Expo at the inauguration ceremony.

The exhibition will be open to the public free of charge from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
