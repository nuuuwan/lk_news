How to build a culture of service excellence: Ron Kaufman to lead event in Colombo

In light of Sri Lanka’s emergence from its worst-ever economic crisis, organizations must prioritize customer service excellence as they navigate evolving business landscapes, changing customer needs, and heightened competition. Effective, authentic customer service remains the cornerstone of any successful organization, news release connected with an upcoming event said.

Well-known Global Customer Experience Guru Ron Kaufman will lead an event in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on June 6 at Waters Edge, Battaramulla, focusing on uplifting customer service and elevating organizational excellence amidst challenging contexts.

Kaufman is known for his holistic approach to service design, execution and transformation to create a customer service culture that supports employees, delights customers and drives organizational performance.

A case study demonstrating the transformative power of excellence in customer service is the experience of Air Mauritius. Collaborating with Kaufman and his team in June 2012, the airline successfully overhauled its service culture. This effort resulted in a remarkable turnaround: the organization reversed a $30 million loss, achieved profitability, reduced employee attrition to less than 5%, and significantly improved the compliments-to-complaints ratio from 2:1 to 12:1, the release said.

“Another compelling example is the case of LUX resorts in Mauritius and Maldives, which faced the challenge of maintaining stability during a profound financial crisis in 2010. Despite lacking substantial capital for significant investments due to the fragile external environment, the leadership focused on what they could control.

“Collaborating with Kaufman and team, the organization concentrated on cultivating an exceptional team capable of delivering a world-class guest experience. Through this strategic approach, LUX successfully transformed a mid-tier group of struggling properties into highly acclaimed luxury resorts, achieving remarkable improvements in room rates, occupancy, and profitability by prioritizing excellence in customer service.”

A unique aspect of the event, the release said, is that it is attuned to Sri Lanka’s current contexts and challenges, offering valuable insights for organizations aiming to revamp their services for diverse client bases. Additionally, the event is tailored to accommodate entrepreneurs and professionals across all levels, ranging from c-suite executives to managers to customer service representatives.

“Furthermore, the insights gained from this session will prove invaluable to leaders, teams, and organizations in leisure & travel, airlines, logistics, IT/Software BPO services, banks & financial services, insurance, telecom, retail business, hospitals, education, real estate, various professional services, exporters and investor services,” it said.
