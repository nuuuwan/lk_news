Sri Lanka’s first ever participation at International Jewellery Vietnam 2024

The Embassy of Sri Lanka in Vietnam in collaboration with the National Gem and Jewellery Authority (NGJA) and Industrial Development Board (IDB) organised the participation of Sri Lankan companies at the International Jewellery Vietnam 2024 for the first time. The fair was held from 8 to 11 June 2024 at Nguyen Du Stadium in Ho Chi Minh City.

Five Sri Lankan companies namely, Prasad Gems and Lapidary, Ranmuthu Jewellers, Elegant Jewellery Works, Oriental Jewel Craft and Southern Jewellery and WorkShop participated in the fair. The fair displayed many products such as diamonds, sapphires, rubies, emeralds, coloured gemstones, amber, pearls of high quality, attractive jewellery collections made from gold and silver, and also machinery, equipment, tools, chemicals, and packaging used in the jewellery industry.

In addition to Sri Lanka, Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Poland, Thailand and Vietnam participated in the fair. Around 3,000 visitors visited the fair and they were mainly from the gem and jewellery industry. Sri Lankan booths had a greater attraction from the visitors, as this was the first time Sri Lankan gems and jewellery were exhibited in this market.

During the event, Sri Lankan companies were able to secure deals and find long term buyers. Though not yet properly explored, Vietnam is a potential and lucrative market for Sri Lankan gem and jewellery. As there is an increasing interest for Sri Lankan gems and jewellery in Vietnam, the Vietnam Association of Gemstones (VAG) has agreed to send a delegation of eight businessmen to the Ratnapura International Gem and Jewellery Show, which will be held from 29 June to 1 July 2024 in Ratnapura. One Vietnamese company would also exhibit their products at the Ratnapura International Gem and Jewellery Show.

Minister (Commercial) of the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Hanoi Kishani Wickramasinghe coordinated Sri Lanka’s successful participation at the IJV 2024.
