Government to blacklist institutions not purchasing farmersâ€™ paddy at minimum prices

The government has decided to blacklist small and medium scale rice millers, paddy collectors and paddy warehouse owners and institutions if they do not purchase the farmers' paddy stocks at the minimum prices set by the government.

The government has made arrangements to provide loans through several state and commercial banks at a concessional interest rates to buy paddy from farmers.

Also, the minimum prices for paddy have been announced so as to be very beneficial to the farmers.

Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said a minimum price for paddy was decided upon this year to protect the farmers and consumers, and currently traders are buying paddy from farmers at a price of Rs. 70-80 per kilo.

The Minister also mentioned that the government will provide an amount of Rs. 09 billion to the small and medium rice mill owners, paddy collectors and paddy warehouse owners at a subsidized interest rate for the paddy purchasing programme.
