Dilith announced Sarvajana Balaya Presidential Candidate

Businessman Dilith Jayaweera has been selected as the Presidential Candidate of the Sarvajana Balaya political alliance for the upcoming Presidential Election.

The announcement was made by National Freedom Front (NFF) leader MP Wimal Weerawansa at the Sarvajana Balaya convention held at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium in Colombo yesterday.

Addressing the event, Weerawansa emphasised the need for a political force that is genuinely patriotic and committed to the country. He said as a result, the party’s Executive Council has unanimously decided to nominate Dilith Jayaweera as the alliance’s Presidential Candidate.

The Sarvajana Balaya, a newly formed political coalition launched in May this year, includes Jayaweera’s Mawbima Janatha Party (MJP), MP Wimal Weerawansa’s National Freedom Front (NFF), and MP Udaya Gammanpila’s Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (JHU), among other parties.

The alliance also features MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara’s Democratic Left Front, the Communist Party, MP Gevindu Kumaratunga’s Yuthukama National Organisation, and a group of independent MPs led by MP Channa Jayasumana.
