Three ministerial portfolios brought under Presidentâ€™s purview

The ministerial portfolios of Tourism and Lands, Sports and Youth Affairs and the Labour and Foreign Employment have been brought under the purview of the President Ranil Wickremesinghe through an Extraordinary Gazette issued on Wednesday.

The Gazette Notification issued by the Secretary to the President Saman Ekanayake by order of the President stated that it was issued after having consulted with the Prime Minister under Article 44 (3) of the Constitution.

The move comes after former Ministers Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakkara lost their Parliamentary seats last week as the Supreme Court ruling upheld their expulsion from the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB).
