TNA’s Sasikala Raviraj and Senathirajah discuss northern development with President

In a series of high-level discussions focused on the future of the Northern Province, Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leaders Sasikala Raviraj and Kalaiamuthan Mavai Senathirajah have taken steps to push forward comprehensive development and investment strategies.

The talks, held recently between President Ranil Wickremesinghe with key TNA members at the Jetwing Hotel, Jaffna, aim to address the long-standing economic and infrastructure challenges faced by the Northern community, with a strong emphasis on inclusive and sustainable development initiatives, the media unit of Wickremesinghe said.

Kalaiamuthan, recently elected to the Valikamam North Pradeshiya Sabha, has taken an active role in driving these discussions. As the son of TNA leader and former MP Mavai Senathirajah, Kalaiamuthan has emerged as a key figure in local politics, working to identify investment opportunities and initiatives that can stimulate long-term growth in the Northern region. His focus, alongside Raviraj, is on improving infrastructure, creating job opportunities, and addressing the broader social and economic concerns of the Northern Tamil community.

Sasikala Raviraj, spouse of the late MP Nadaraja Raviraj, underscored the importance of these initiatives for securing a prosperous future for the Northern Province, which continues to recover from the aftereffects of decades of conflict.

The discussions come at a time when Northern development is gaining renewed political attention.

President Wickremesinghe also met with TNA leader Mavai Senathirajah at his residence where Senathirajah expressed confidence in President Wickremesinghe’s leadership in the run-up to the presidential election. Senathirajah, a long-standing advocate for Northern issues, believes Wickremesinghe can play a crucial role in resolving the grievances of the Tamil people while promoting economic rejuvenation in the North.

Following their meeting, Senathirajah shared with the media that the President’s commitment to Northern development aligns with the goals of the TNA.
