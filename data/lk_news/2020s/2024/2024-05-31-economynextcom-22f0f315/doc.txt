Donald Trump convicted 34 times in first for ex-US president

ECONOMYNEXT – Former US President Donald Trump has been convicted by the jury for falsifying business records in a case linked to paying off a former porn star.

Trump is expected to be sentenced on July 11 but Trumps lawyers are also expected to appeal the decision.

Trump slammed the judge as ‘corrupt’ and claimed he was a ‘very innocent man’ after the jury delivered the verdict.

The trial should have been held in a different location where there were more Republicans instead of the New York, where he did not win, he said.

However many Trump businesses had been based for years in New York.

Reporters in the courtroom said the jury was widely expected to go home for the day for further deliberations and those present were ‘stunned’ by the verdict that came at the end of the day.

Trump’s fund-raising website crashed in what the Republican activists said was a rush by his supporters to donate.

Trump is also facing trials for inciting a ‘riot’ in Washington. (Colombo/May31/2024)
