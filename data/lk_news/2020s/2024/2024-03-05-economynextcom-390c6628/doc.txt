Sri Lankan Airlines interest deadline, final bid timelines extended

ECONOMYNEXT – The deadline to express interest in state-run SriLankan Airlines was extended to April 22, from March 05, and the timeline to submit final bids of qualified investors was pushed back to August 2024 from May, Sri Lanka’s divestiture agency said.

The indicative timeline to cabinet approval for any sale agreement was pushed back to September from an earlier June.

No reason was given for the extension. The timeline is close to election time.

The selection of pre-qualified bidders is now scheduled for May 2024 from March and bidder one-to-one meeting to June.
