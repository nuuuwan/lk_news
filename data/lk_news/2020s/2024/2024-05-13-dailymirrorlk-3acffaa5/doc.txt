Restraining order issued preventing obstacles to Wijedasa Rajapakse’ SLFP Chairmanship

A restraining order on instituting any legal action against the decision taken by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Executive Committee on May 12, to appoint Minister Wijedasa Rajapakse as Chairman of the SLFP was issued by Kaduwela District Judge Dulani Wickremesuriya.

Executive Committee Members Isuru Abeywardene and Sumith Wijemuni Soysa had sought a court order allowing Chairman of the SLFP Wijedasa Rajapakse, Acting Secretary Kirthi Udawatta and the politburo to carry out their functions without any obstacles.

A panel of lawyers including President’s Counsel Ikram Mohmed appeared for the petitioners who had sited 20 respondents to the petition.
