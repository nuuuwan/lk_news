Sajith criticizes govt’s delayed public relief efforts

The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) presidential candidate Sajith Premadasa emphasized that the public would have reaped greater benefits had the government’s recently announced relief measures been introduced earlier this year.

Addressing a public rally held in Matara, Premadasa stated, “All possible burdens have already been placed on the people. Now, in a rush for the upcoming election, the president is making announcements about reducing taxes, increasing salaries, and offering concessions.”

“These concessions should have been implemented at the start of the year, not at this late stage,” he declared.

He also dismissed claims made by Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the National People’s Power (NPP) presidential candidate, that his party was planning to incite violence.

“I heard Mr. Anura Kumara accuse us of plotting violent acts. We have never engaged in violence. The people of this country will not fall for the traps he’s setting,” Premadasa asserted.

The rally in Matara was the 51st of a series organized by the SJB in support of Premadasa’s presidential bid.
