Ex-Health Minister Keheliya brought to court

Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella was brought to the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court on Thursday afternoon for the proceedings of the case in connection with the substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) vials procurement.

When the former minister was produced before the court on March 14, the magistrate refused to release him on bail and ordered that he be further remanded until the conclusion of the case filed under the provisions of the Public Property Act.

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Rambukwella on 02 February over his alleged complicity in the procurement of substandard IVIG vials.

The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker.

On 29 February, Rambukwella’s attorneys also filed a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition challenging his arrest by the CID and demanding Rs. 100 million in compensation.
