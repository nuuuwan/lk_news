Assetline Finance launches Assetline Green Loan to support solar energy investments

Assetline Finance Limited (AFL) recently launched Assetline Green Loan, a specialised financing facility aimed at empowering individuals as well as Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises to invest in solar energy solutions. This initiative is designed to make solar energy adoption more accessible and affordable.

With solar power emerging as a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to traditional energy sources, Assetline Finance is committed to helping customers harness the benefits of renewable energy as part of its sustainability agenda.

“Whether you are a homeowner looking to switch to solar energy or a business aiming to reduce operational costs and environmental impact, the Assetline Green Loan offers an excellent opportunity to embrace sustainable practices with ease,” said Ashan Nissanka, Director and CEO of AFL.

Assetline Finance provides competitive interest rates, making solar system installations more affordable for borrowers. Customers can make an initial, manageable investment and then use the savings from their electricity bills to cover the monthly installment. Additionally, surplus power generation can potentially generate additional income and increase the value of the property. This combination makes investing in solar energy a smart business decision. Assetline Finance also provides personalised doorstep service island wide through its 56 branches, ensuring convenience and support throughout the loan application and solar installation process. Initially, financing will be available for solar installation by selected solar solution providers.
