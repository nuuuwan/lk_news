Mathews, Chandimal centuries put Sri Lanka in control of Afghanistan Test

Centuries from Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal consolidated Sri Lanka's strong position on day two of their one-off Test against Afghanistan at the Singhalese Sports Club today.

Sri Lanka started the day with a 118-run deficit, but reached stumps on 410 for 6, and 212 runs ahead of the visiting team who toiled through much of the day with little success.

Such was the control and comfort Mathews enjoyed for a majority of his time at the crease in reaching his 16th century in the format, that it took a freak dismissal to end the former Sri Lanka captain's innings for 141.

In the final over of the day, Mathews swept hard at a poor delivery from Qais Ahmed, but hit the stumps on his follow through, to dislodge the bails.

Together with Chandimal, Mathews ground out the Aghanistan bowlers through the second session of play, which went wicketless.

The pair put on a 232-run partnership for the fourth wicket, before Chandimal was caught behind shortly after reaching his 15th Test century.

One brought two for Afghanistan, with Sri Lanka's new Test captain Dhananjaya de Silva being run out on the very next delivery -- de Silva setting off after driving the ball to mid-off only for a ball-watching Mathews to not respond quickly enough.

Sadeera Samarawickrama scored at just over a run a ball, hitting three boundaries and a six on the way to an unbeaten 21 off 22 balls.

Earlier in the day, Naveed Zadran broke the opening wicket partnership between Nishan Madushka and Dimuth Karunaratne, continuing from their overnight score of 80 for 0, when the former was caught at leg slip for 37.

Sri Lanka lost their second wicket 22 runs later, when Kusal mendis top edged a short ball to long leg, before a third scalp in the opening session followed with the dismissal of Dimuth Karunaratne for 77.
