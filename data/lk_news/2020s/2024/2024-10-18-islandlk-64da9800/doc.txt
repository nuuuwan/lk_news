Yohani’s debut album “Kella” submitted for Grammy consideration in “Best Global Music Album” category

South Asian pop sensation Yohani has achieved a remarkable milestone with her debut album “Kella” being officially submitted for consideration in the Best Global Music Album category at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. This submission marks a historic moment, not only for Yohani but also for Sri Lankan music, as “Kella” becomes the first album from Sri Lanka to be considered for this prestigious global accolade.

Released on December 8, 2023, “Kella” features 14 tracks that seamlessly blend traditional Sri Lankan sounds with contemporary global music. With 11 songs in Sinhalese and 3 in English, the album incorporates native Sri Lankan percussion, folk stories, and cultural motifs. Yohani, who first captivated international audiences in 2021 with her viral hit Manike Mage Hithe, views “Kella” as a deeply personal expression of her roots and her musical vision.
