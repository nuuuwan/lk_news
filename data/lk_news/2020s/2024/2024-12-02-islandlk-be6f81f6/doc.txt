History in the making!

Singer/composer Rajiv Sebastian says he has created history with the release of his latest music video, which is in the form of a duet with the veteran classical vocalist Bandula Wijeweera.

Says Rajiv: “With the demise of the gutty Sunil Perera (of Gypsies fame), people assumed that there will be no celebrity to criticize Sri Lankan politicians, and my new music video, with Bandula Wijeweera, changes that misconception.”

, according to Rajiv, is a surprising masterpiece in filling that vacuum.

Rajiv, of course, has shared his creativity with many well-known singers, including the late Desmond De Silva, also the late Sunil Perera, Annesley, Sohan, Corrine (remember ‘Mage Konde Nathath’), Falan, as well as Yohani (‘Halmessa’), and his contributions have been well received over the past three decades.
