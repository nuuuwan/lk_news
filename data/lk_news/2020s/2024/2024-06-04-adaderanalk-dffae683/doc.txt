CEB to submit electricity tariff revision proposal to PUCSL this week

Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera says that a discussion was held with the Ceylon Electricity Board’s (CEB) tariff division yesterday to finalize the electricity consumer tariff revision proposal.

In a post on ‘X’ (formerly Twitter), he pointed out that the Government made a policy decision last year to implement a cost-reflective tariff mechanism, with tariffs to be revised quarterly each year.

Accordingly, the July tariff proposal will be submitted to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) this week, the minister said.
