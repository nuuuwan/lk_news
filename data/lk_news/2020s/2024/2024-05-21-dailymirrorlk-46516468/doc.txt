Move to sell LSD-infected cattle amid disease outbreak

With the outbreak of the Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) among cattle in the Nuwara Eliya District, there is a growing tendency among dairy farmers to sell off their affected livestock.

Dr. Suresh Kumara, the Government Veterinary Surgeon in charge of the Kotagala-Talawakele division, reported that the district contributes 12 percent of the Central Provinceâ€™s milk production.

The outbreak has led to the death of many milch cows, resulting in a sharp decline in milk output.

In response to the outbreak, affected dairy farmers have begun selling their LSD-infected cattle to slaughterhouses.

Dr. Kumara emphasized the need for vaccination to control the disease but noted that the necessary vaccine is currently unavailable.
