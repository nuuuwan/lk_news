SriLankan Airlines denies TU action for flight delays

ECONOMYNEXT – State-owned SriLankan Airlines denied any trade union action for the delay of its flights at the country’s main airport early on Sunday.

Airport sources said four SriLankan Airlines flights faced delay and a frustrated ground handling staff were unable to coop up with the situation after the delays.

“SriLankan Airlines would like to clarify that the delays experienced by its passengers at the check-in counters in Bandaranaike International Airport during the early hours of this morning, were caused by temporary, unplanned operational conditions at the airport and not due to any type of trade union action,” SriLankan said in a statement.

“The check-in counter operations have been stabilized and returned to normal as of now,” said the firm which is now seeking opportunities for divestment under the government’s restructuring plans of state-owned enterprises reforms.

“SriLankan Airlines would like to apologize to any passengers inconvenienced by these operational delays, while the airline continues to monitor the situation and take steps to avoid a recurrence.”

The Airline, which once was profitable under Dubai-based Emirates management until 2007 has witnessed a raft of technical issues in Colombo as well as foreign airports recently.

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa did not extend the deal with Emirates after the Dubai-based carrier failed to allocate a large government contingent with him to travel to London. (Colombo/Feb 25/2024)
