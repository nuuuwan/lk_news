Sri Lanka seeks UN help for Vesak celebrations

ECONOMYNEXT – The government is in discussions to get financial aid from the United Nations for its 2024 State Vesak festival, Minister of Religious and Cultural Affairs Vidura Wickramanayake has said.

The Chinese Cultural Promotion, Buddhist Culture and Art Association had agreed to the minister’s request to facilitate support from the United Nations for the State Vesak festival, Wickramanayake who is in China, was quoted as saying in a statement by the Department of Government Information.

A delegation from the Association will visit Sri Lanka to discuss this further, the statement said.

Wickramanayake had also requested the Association to provide an opportunity for Buddhist monks from Sri Lanka to visit China and study Mahayana Buddhism.

Vesak, a Buddhist religious holiday which marks the birth, enlightenment and death of Lord Buddha is celebrated in Sri Lanka with much fanfare; the construction of pandals and the display of lanterns attract large crowds at night over a few days.

The government generally closes liquor stores during the Vesak week. Last year, this resulted in a tax revenue loss of around one billion rupees for the government, the Department of Excise said at the time. (Colombo/Jan19/2024)
