Sri Lanka president contests election with gas cylinder symbol, says “Still more to be done”

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s President Ranil Wickremesinghe handed in his nomination papers for the September 21 election at the Election Commission today, opting to contest under a symbol of a domestic cooking gas cylinder.

“Today, I officially announce my candidacy for President of Sri Lanka, and to continue my duties to you, the Sri Lankan people,” Wickremesinghe tweeted, after changing his twitter handle from RW_UNP to @RW_SRILANKA.

Wickremesinghe is the leader of the United National Party, but is contesting as an independent candidate.

“Sri Lanka is on a journey. Since 2022, we have worked hard together to recover from our past challenges, but there is still more to be done.

“My commitment to you and our country is unwavering. Together, we will continue to build a prosperous future, but that can only be done with stability.”

His choice of symbol is interesting, as a spate of explosions and fires attributed to liquid petroleum (LP) gas cylinders or related accessories caused a panic in 2021.

At the time the Court of Appeal ordered the country’s cooking gas companies to recall LP gas cylinders in the market and replace them free of charge with cylinders approved by the Sri Lanka Standards Institute.

In 2022, a forex crisis led to severe shortages including of the gas used in cooking. People had to line up for days for refills of the cylinder. (Colombo/Aug15/2024)
