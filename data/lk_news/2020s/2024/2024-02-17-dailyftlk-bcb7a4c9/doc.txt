Japan provides Yen 1.2 b grant to power 3 hospitals with renewable energy

Japanese Ambassador Mizukoshi Hideaki and Treasury Secretary K.M.M. Siriwardana this week signed an Exchange of Note for providing JPY 1.23 billion in order to improve power supply vulnerability at hospitals.

This signing ceremony was held in the presence of JICA President Dr. Tanaka Akihiko and Health Secretary Dr. P.G. Mahipala.

This grant aims to reduce carbon footprint and ease the financial burden on energy costs at Sri Jayewardenepura General Hospital, Teaching Hospital Ratnapura, and Teaching Hospital Kurunegala. With this assistance, the recipient hospitals will be equipped with solar power facilities, ensuring reliable electricity supply and contributing to achieving Sri Lanka’s goal of over 70% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030.

This project, similar to the fuel assistance, contributes to enhancing Sri Lanka’s healthcare infrastructure. The introduction of solar power facilities aims to improve the resilience of these healthcare institutions and contribute to the well-being of the Sri Lankan people. The collaboration signifies a strong commitment to improving healthcare services and promoting sustainable energy solutions, underlining the bilateral relations between Japan and Sri Lanka.

The Japanese Government said it looks forward to a successful implementation of the solar power facilities,

supporting Sri Lanka in achieving renewable energy goals and fostering a greener future.
