Sri Lanka eyes private battery systems to counter renewable power instability

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet of ministers had given approval to develop grid scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) to maintain power system stability as variable renewable power plants expand, a government statement said.

Sri Lanka is expecting to connect large volumes solar and wind power between 2024-2030 to meet a 70 percent renewable electricity target, but due to variability of wind and solar (non-firm energy), the system stability is undermined.

As a result, the power grid has to be able to absorb the shocks from non-firm energy.

Battery energy systems storage (BESS) is one of the solutions identified in a long-term generation plan, the statement said.

A committee appointed to study the issue had recommended building battery banks.

The cabinet had approved the development of battery storage system as public private partnerships or private projects. (Colombo/May24/2025)
