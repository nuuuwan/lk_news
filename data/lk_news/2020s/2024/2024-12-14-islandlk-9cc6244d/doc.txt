ComBank MD/CEO Sanath Manatunge honoured as ‘Diversity Champion’

Commercial Bank of Ceylon Managing Director/CEO Sanath Manatunge has been recognised as one of the ‘Top 10 Diversity Champions’ in Sri Lanka in 2024 for his leadership in fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion within Sri Lanka’s banking sector.

This prestigious recognition is part of the Top 10 Diversity Champion Awards Programme organised by Women in Management (WIM) in partnership with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, under the ‘Respectful Workplaces’ initiative.

The selection of the country’s Top 10 Diversity Champions was based on a rigorous process of evaluation by a panel of judges which included Gevorg Sargsyan, Country Manager for the World Bank and IFC.

Manatunge’s unwavering commitment to an inclusive workplace has driven a profound cultural transformation at Commercial Bank, where every employee, regardless of background, ethnicity, gender, or orientation feels valued and empowered, the Bank said. His dedication to diversity and inclusion has positioned Commercial Bank as a beacon of equitable leadership, reshaping industry standards and setting a new benchmark for what it means to be a true champion of diversity.

Notably, Commercial Bank was recently ranked No 1 among Sri Lankan banks in the inaugural Corporate Happiness Index (CHI) of LMD magazine. The Bank was the highest-ranked bank in 14 of the 16 attributes used to compile the index, including the attributes of ‘Gender balance’ and ‘Workplace diversity.’
