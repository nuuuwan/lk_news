Draft Bill to reduce age of sexual consent to 14 years to be withdrawn after outcry

The Bill gazetted on 09 February 2024 by the government in order to amend Chapter 19 of the Penal Code regarding the age of a girl to have sexual relations of her own interest, will be withdrawn, says Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reform Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe.

According to the amendments made to the Penal Code in 1995, even if a victim under 16 years of age has sexual relations of their own free will, it is considered rape. However, the proposed amendment to the Penal Code by the Justice Minister sought to lower the age of sexual consent to 14 years.

Nevertheless, speaking to the media following an event held in Colombo today (23), Rajapakshe stated that he has informed the Attorney General that the draft would not be proceeded with and that it would be withdrawn from the Parliament.

“Several individuals have approached me requesting the suspension of the passing of this Bill. I have conveyed to them that further discussions must ensue”, the Minister said.

“When the draft [Bill] was challenged before the Supreme Court, I informed the Attorney General that we would not proceed with it. Instead, discussions will be held with the concerned parties, and a decision will be made following these discussions. For the time being, it will be withdrawn from Parliament,” he added.
