State Minister defends President’s foreign trips

Colombo, Feb 01 -  State Minister of Foreign Affairs Taraka Balasuriya, has defended President Ranil Wickremesinghe's recent foreign trips against criticism and stressed that Sri Lanka cannot afford to be isolated on the global stage.

He dismissed claims that the trips were unnecessary, emphasizing their importance in strengthening Sri Lanka's foreign relations and securing new partnerships, the President’s Media Division said.

He argued that foreign relations are crucial for the country's development, and that the President's visits are essential for building bridges and fostering cooperation with other nations. He dismissed criticisms of the trips as baseless, asserting that they play a vital role in Sri Lanka's pursuit of progress.

State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya, speaking at a press briefing yesterday (01) titled 'Collective Path to a Stable Country,' held at the President Media Centre (PMC) highlighted recent efforts to attract investment and rebuild the nation.

The recent visits served a dual purpose. Firstly, they solidified the "offline policy," suggesting a renewed focus on domestic affairs. Secondly, discussions addressed the crucial issue of preventing regional spill over from the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.

By collaborating with regional leaders, the State Minister expressed confidence in containing these conflicts. He further emphasized the contribution of these interactions to global peace, State Minister Tharaka explained.
