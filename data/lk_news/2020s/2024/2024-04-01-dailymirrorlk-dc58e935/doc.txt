AG’s Department has done its duty, other institutions should act: Minister

The Attorney General's Department has implemented the action recommended by the Presidential Commission which probed the Easter Sunday attacks while it is up to other institutions to act, Minister of Justice Wijedasa Rajapakshe told Parliament today.

“The Presidential Commission which probed the Easter Sunday attacks made recommendations to various institutions such as the Attorney General’s Department and the police. The Attorney General’s Department had filed 41 court cases against 79 persons as of now. It is essential for the other institutions such as the police to implement the other recommendations of the Presidential Commission,” the Minister said.

Leader of the House Susil Premajayantha informed the Parliament that the Attorney General’s Department has already begun a legal exercise on the recent remark made by former President Maithripala Sirisena that he is aware of the mastermind behind the Easter Sunday attacks.

"Making a statement with regard to the remarks made by MP Sirisena will be sub judice,” he said.

Meanwhile, MP Kavinda Jayawardene requested Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardene to get the former President to reveal everything that he knows about the Easter Sunday attacks.

“The Speaker has the right to get the former President to reveal in Parliament what he knows about the Easter Sunday attacks,” he said.
