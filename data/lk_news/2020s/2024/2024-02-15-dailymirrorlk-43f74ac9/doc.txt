Sri Lanka’s tourism sector is gearing up for a major transformation, as the authorities unveil an ambitious plan to make the country one of the world’s most dynamic and sought-after destinations.

Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTPB) Chairman Chalaka Gajabahu announced yesterday that the SLTPB is set to enter into agreements with a consortium of global brands, both foreign and domestic, to sponsor and promote a series of exciting events. This move comes as part of a larger strategy to boost tourism and make 2024 the best year yet for Sri Lanka’s tourism industry.

“We will make it a more happening destination; 2024 is going to be a very positive year,” Gajabahu declared.

Sri Lanka’s tourism scene has long grappled with a shortage of compelling events and activities to engage tourists and encourage higher spending. This is a concern that has been frequently raised.

The fresh initiatives by the tourism authorities aim to significantly boost tourism activities, with the goal of increasing the average daily spend of tourists to US $ 500 from the current US $ 160, putting Sri Lanka in league with luxury destinations like the Maldives.

As per the provisional data by the Central Bank, the earnings per tourist witnessed a rebound in January 2024. The earnings per tourist arrival have improved to US $ 1,641 in January, from US $ 1,580 in the 1H23 period. In the 2H23 period, the earnings dropped significantly.

“This is a step-by-step process. It won’t happen overnight,” Gajabahu emphasised.

The event calendar will feature a diverse range of activities, including a water festival, Ride for Ceylon and a ‘unique’ event in Sigiriya.

“I can’t divulge more details of the Sigiriya event but I can say it will be a surprise,” Gajabahu teased.

Additionally, a key meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) event is scheduled to be held in the south of Sri Lanka next year.

The recent surge in European tourists has been particularly encouraging for the tourism sector. The European tourists, known for their longer stays of nine to 10 days or even up to two weeks, contribute significantly to tourism revenue.

Gajabahu highlighted the success of influencer programmes in promoting Sri Lanka in emerging European markets such as Poland. The SLTPB plans to expand the influencer programme with a category-based approach.

Furthermore, the SLTPB, in collaboration with the European Union, will launch a wellness tourism campaign by inviting 30 influencers from Germany and France, starting from the 15th of this month.

With these new initiatives, the SLTPB is confident in surpassing its target of 2.3 million tourist arrivals and US $ 4 billion in income for the year
