Arrogance of crooks

There have been instances where queues brought about tectonic shifts in Sri Lankan politics. Ubiquitous queues for essentials, inter alia, caused the collapse of the SLFP-led United Front government in 1977, and it took the SLFP 17 years to make a comeback. It was also long queues for fuel, milk food, etc., that made President Gotabaya Rajapaksa head for the hills before resigning, about two years ago, and catapulted Ranil Wickremesinghe, the solo UNP MP, to the presidency. Queues play a critical role in influencing and shaping public opinion, given Sri Lankans’ aversion to them.

A Sinhala daily has reported that long queues have been observed near the on-arrival visa counters at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) since the suspension by the Supreme Court (SC) of a questionable on-arrival visa processing scheme handled by a foreign company. The previous system worked smoothly, and how has the situation reported by the aforesaid newspaper come about?

Is it that some government grandees are engineering queues at BIA in a bid to turn public opinion against the SC and make a case for the restoration of the controversial visa processing system? The Department of Immigration and Emigration has not fully complied with the SC order in question, according to media reports. It has sought to muddy the waters by dragging the Attorney General’s Department and Parliament into the controversy. It would not have done so without the blessings of the government.

Worryingly, under the current dispensation, attempts to intimidate the judiciary have become the order of the day. In 1983, a UNP government had the Supreme Court judges’ houses pelted with stone because it failed to keep the judiciary under its thumb, and today threats and insults are hurled at the SC; some government MPs, who are lawyers themselves, demand that the upright judges who refuse to give in to political pressure be summoned before parliamentary committees.

Their obnoxious conduct reminds us of attacks on judicial independence during President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s second term, when a Chief Justice (CJ) was hounded out of office with the help of a Parliamentary Select Committee. CJ Shirani Bandaranayake suffered that fate because she stood up to the Rajapaksa government. The UNP-led Yahapalana government made a CJ disappear, in a manner of speaking; President Maithripala Sirisena declared the appointment of Mohan Peiris as CJ Bandaranayake’s successor void ab initio.

That government did not care to follow the proper procedure; it should have made Parliament right the wrong it had done. Former President Sirisena is an SLPP MP. Can there be a bigger threat to judicial independence and democracy than a political union between the UNP and the SLPP?

Stringent action must be taken against the masterminds behind the visa scam, which is believed to have cost the country much more than the Treasury bond racket. They are trying every trick in the book to restore the questionable visa processing system, which is alleged to have helped fatten their offshore accounts. Their efforts to make the SC interim order at issue out to be an impediment to the on-arrival visa issuance process must be defeated.

The fact that the current regime is falling apart and scared of facing elections has not deterred its bigwigs and their bureaucratic lackeys from defying judicial decisions, undermining the apex court, suppressing democratic dissent and cutting corrupt deals at the expense of the state coffers. The question that Sri Lankans ought to ask themselves before voting at future elections is this; will the rule of law survive if the characters bent on suppressing democracy and amassing ill-gotten wealth are given a fresh mandate to govern this country?
