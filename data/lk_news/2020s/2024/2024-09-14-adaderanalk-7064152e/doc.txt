All vehicle revenue license issuing counters in WP closed on Friday

All vehicle revenue license issuing counters in the Western Province will be closed on September 20, 2024, the Department of Government Information (DGI) announced.

This closure will take place in preparation for the upcoming presidential election on September 21, as it is necessary to allow officials to attend the election duties, the DGI said in a statement.

Meanwhile, in order to ensure that vehicle owners can still obtain their revenue licenses without incurring any fines, the revenue licenses which are due to expire on September 20, will be allowed to be obtained on the next working day following the election, not subject to the fines, it added.

For convenience, vehicle owners can also renew their revenue licenses online by visiting the website [www.motortraffic.wp.gov.lk] to complete the process.
