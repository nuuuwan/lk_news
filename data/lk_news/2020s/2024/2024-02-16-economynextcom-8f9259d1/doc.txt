Sri Lanka exporters confident about growth prospects: Chamber survey

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lankan exporters have said political stability and a consistent energy supply were crucial facilitators for export growth in 2024, according to a survey by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.

“Exporters stressed that increasing utility prices and the cost of transport and logistics posed significant challenges during 2023,” the Export Barometer Survey by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce showed, the chamber said on X (twitter).

In the survey covering 2023 and forecasting 2024, exporters expressed confidence in their growth prospects.

“Service-oriented exporters grappled with a lack of skilled labour, highlighting a sector-specific challenge that warrants attention. However, most exporters identified new business opportunities, leading to workforce expansion to meet growing production demands.”

Amidst economic dynamics, the export sector exhibited robust growth in 2023, the report found.

“Digital transformation was a key trend, with exporting firms, especially SMEs, leveraging digital tools for streamlined processes. From digital marketing to cutting-edge technologies, exporters embraced innovation to enhance global visibility.”

Despite global uncertainties, Sri Lankan exporters remained optimistic about economic and export growth in 2024, the chamber said, adding that, exporters plan to implement strategic measures, including adopting more competitive pricing strategies, to boost export orders. (Colombo/Feb16/2024)
