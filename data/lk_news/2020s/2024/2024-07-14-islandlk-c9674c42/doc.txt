Omega Line wins 2 Bronze awards at Green Industry Symposium

Italy-based Calzedonia Group (now known as Oniverse)’s Lankan affiliate, Omega Line Ltd, was awarded two bronze awards at the International Symposium on Green Industry Initiative for Sustainable Industrial Development, held at BMICH in Colombo.

The first bronze recognized Omega Line’s energy-efficient initiatives, such as transitioning from clutch to servo motors in sewing machines, employing LED lighting, optimizing compressed air usage, and implementing motion-activated lighting in low-occupancy areas, all contributing significantly to reduced energy consumption and environmental impact.

The second bronze acknowledged Omega Line’s substantial efforts in solar energy, with nearly a third of its energy now being generated from solar sources. These initiatives have resulted in significant carbon emission reductions, amounting to over 1.46 million kilograms saved annually, equivalent to planting approximately 43,600 trees. Omega Line aims to achieve full solar energy dependency by 2030.

Located in Sandalankawa, Omega Line Ltd is part of the Oniverse Group, employing over 15,500 individuals in Sri Lanka and exporting nearly 200 million garments in 2023. Despite economic challenges, the group’s turnover exceeded USD 600 million, with total investments in Sri Lanka surpassing USD 350 million to date.

Celebrating its 25th year, Omega Line and its parent company, Calzedonia, have significantly expanded from fewer than 300 sales outlets in 1999 to over 5,500 outlets across 55 countries today. Omega Line’s growth trajectory continues to make a profound impact on the global intimate apparel market.
