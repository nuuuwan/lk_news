Sri Lanka will not jeopardise India’s security concerns: State Minister

Feb 23 - State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya has assured India that the island will not be used by another country jeopardising India’s security concerns.

The Minister made these comments speaking to Indian media on the sidelines of the 9th edition of Raisina Dialogue in Delhi, responding to questions about a Chinese vessel docking in the Maldives waters on Friday.

"India should not be worried about the security concern. We know India’s growing stature and we will not be used by any third party or country to jeopardize India’s security. So through honest and candid exchange of views, we can overcome any problem," Balasuriya said.

Assuring New Delhi on security concerns, he said: "We are open for business with any country. But when it comes to India we have a special relationship. I think India should not be worried about our relationship with China. It’s not only with China, we have good relations with Western countries, the US, Russia, and the Middle East.”
