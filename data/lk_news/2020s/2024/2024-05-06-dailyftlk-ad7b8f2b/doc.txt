Govt. kicks off revolutionary move of granting free land rights to citizens

President Ranil Wickremesinghe hailed his own Government’s decision to grant free land rights to the people as a ground-breaking step, emphasising that no other nation has undertaken such a massive initiative to date.

The President made these remarks while participating in the inaugural event for distributing freehold land deeds to Mahaweli settlers as part of the “Urumaya” program at Polonnaruwa Royal Central College on Saturday.

Emphasising the principle that as one section of the population benefits from the country’s economy, another should not be left to suffer, the President underscored that the revolutionary initiative of granting free land titles was launched to uplift low-income individuals.

He urged the people to actively participate in building the economy in collaboration with the Government’s agricultural modernisation program, highlighting the potential for Polonnaruwa to become a key export district in the country.

The President highlighted his achievement in swiftly stabilising the country’s economy with the help of one group, despite inheriting a Government initially opposed by all. He extended an invitation to all sectors to collaborate in bolstering the nation’s economy over the next two to three years, aiming to secure a prosperous future for the youth.

The Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority has outlined plans to prepare 204,002 freehold deeds, with ongoing preparations at all regional levels. It is anticipated that 20,178 freehold deeds will be distributed to Mahaweli settlers by the end of May.

To commemorate its launch, 1,340 freehold deeds were distributed to the residents of B, C, Madirigiriya, and Moragahakanda Mahaweli Zones in the Polonnaruwa District.

In a symbolic gesture representing the distribution of land deeds, the President personally handed out deeds to 30 individuals.
