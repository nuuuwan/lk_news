National List MP nominations spark internal crises in NDF and SJB

The nomination process for National List MP positions within the New Democratic Front (NDF) and Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has escalated into internal turmoil, with fierce competition for limited seats.

The NDF only secured two seats and the SJB five seats through the National List in the recent general election.

The crisis deepened following the nomination of Ravi Karunanayake’s name in the Gazette last night (18) as a National List MP for the NDF. The nomination was reportedly made to the Election Commission by the NDF General Secretary without the approval of the member parties, sparking dissent within the alliance.

The Leader of the NDF, Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed dissatisfaction over the decision on Monday, stating that the nomination was made arbitrarily without his or the member parties’ consent. He has convened a meeting in Colombo today with NDF stakeholders to address the issue.

Adding to the controversy, a protest erupted outside Karunanayake’s residence this morning, with heightened security observed in the area.

In the midst of this, a proposal has been made to nominate Kanchana Wijesekera, who unsuccessfully contested the election from the Matara district, for the second National List MP seat allocated to the NDF.

Meanwhile, the SJB has yet to nominate representatives for its five National List MP positions. The delay is attributed to disputes among allied parties that contested under the SJB banner. These groups are vying for representation, creating a stalemate within the alliance.
