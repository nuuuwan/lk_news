Sri Lanka to import 3,000 metric tonnes of ginger

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will import 3,000 metric tonnes of raw ginger within three months to address the shortage of ginger in the local market, Minister Bandula Gunawardena said.

“This will be done in stages so that local growers are not negatively impacted and consumers don’t have to pay unfair prices,” Gunawardena told reporters.

Sri Lanka State Trading (General) Corporation Limited will import the ginger based on recommendations by a committee established to regulate ginger prices, he said.

A kilo of ginger is currently retailing between 3,500 and 4,145 rupees.
