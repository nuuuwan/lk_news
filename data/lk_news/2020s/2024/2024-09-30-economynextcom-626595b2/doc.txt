Sri Lanka’s new government reduces fuel prices after poll campaign allegations

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s new government led by recently elected leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake reduced retail fuel prices for October 2024, state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corporation said.

The CPC on Monday (30) announced fuel prices based on formula which will be effective throughout October 2024.

The CPC reduced mostly used Octane 92 by 21 rupees to 311 rupees a litre, Auto diesel by 24 rupees to 283, and Super diesel by 33 rupees to 319 rupees.

The price of Kerosene is reduced by 19 rupees to 183 rupees. However, it left the price of 95 Octane unchanged at 377 rupees.

During the election campaign, President Dissanayake’s Marxists-led National People’s Power (NPP) accused previous government of burdening the public of exorbitant tax on fuel and some corrupt deals for higher prices.

Some of the NPP members said the price could be reduced by more than 100 rupees through removing the taxes. (Colombo/September 31/2024)
