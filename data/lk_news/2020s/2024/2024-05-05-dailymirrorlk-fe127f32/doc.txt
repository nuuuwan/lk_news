Japan to provide vessel with underwater sonar

The Japanese government has finalized a plan to provide Sri Lanka with a vessel equipped with underwater sonar for detecting the location of other vessels in order to improve the country’s oceanographic survey capabilities, according to Japanese Deputy Press Secretary Kaneko Mariko.

Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa informed Sri Lanka of the decision during a foreign ministerial bilateral discussion on Saturday.

The Japanese government will provide Sri Lanka with a vessel and sonar system worth about 01 billion Yen in total. Kamikawa was expected to emphasize Japan’s position on realizing a free and open Indo-Pacific and demonstrate support for Sri Lanka, which sits in a strategic position along sea lanes.
