“Heat index, the temperature felt on human body is expected to increase up to ‘Caution level’ at some places in Western, North-western, Southern and Sabaragamuwa provinces and in Anuradhapura, Mannar, Trincomalee and Batticaloa districts”, the advisory read.

As per the advisory, under this level of temperature, fatigue is possible with prolonged exposure and activity, while continuing activity could result in heat cramps.

It is generated by the Department of Meteorology for the next day period and prepared by using global numerical weather prediction model data.
