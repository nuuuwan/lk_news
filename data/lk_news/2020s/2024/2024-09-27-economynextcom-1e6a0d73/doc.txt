World Bank says ready to support Sri Lanka President Dissanayake

ECONOMYNEXT – The World Bank group has pledged to continue its support for Sri Lanka in a letter to newly elected President Anura Dissanayake singed by senior regional officers dealing with the country.

The World Bank is providing budget support for Sri Lanka after the central bank plunged the country to its worst currency crisis since its inception by cutting rates with inflationary open market operations from 2020 and failing a float of the currency due to a surrender rule in 2022.

“The World Bank Group and our entire country team, led by our country manager, Gevorg Sargsyan based in Colombo, stand ready to support you and the new administration,” Martin Raiser, Vice President for the South Asia Region and Riccardo Puliti, Vice President for the Asia and Pacific Region of the International Finance Corporation, said in a letter.

“As one of Sri Lanka’s longstanding development partners, the World Bank Group affirms its strong commitment to fostering inclusive growth and economic recovery, and in addressing the pressing issues of the poor and vulnerable.”

The World Bank’s budget support loans are linked to structural benchmarks as co-partners of an IMF backed program.
