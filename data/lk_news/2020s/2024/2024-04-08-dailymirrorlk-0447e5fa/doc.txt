Lower prices in fireworks this festive season

Colombo, April 8 (Daily Mirror) - There is a higher demand for fireworks this year than in the previous festive seasons, but there is less demand for several firework items, All-Island Fireworks Manufacturers Association (AIFMA) President Dinesh Fernando said.

Addressing the media, he said the distribution process of all types of fireworks has started around the country to meet the needs of the people.

The manufacturing of fireworks did not take place at 100% in the previous years due to the financial crisis in the country, Fernando said.

"There is a shortage of several fireworks, such as whistling rockets and whistling spinners, in the local market. The price of the ingredients for the making of fireworks has decreased by 30 percent this year when compared with previous years," he said.

Accordingly, the fireworks price in the local market shows a lower budget, Fernando said.
