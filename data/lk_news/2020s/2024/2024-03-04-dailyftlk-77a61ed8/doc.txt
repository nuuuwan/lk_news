Sri Lanka to improve commercial dispute resolution through mediation

The universal buzz about mediation stems from the benefits the process offers

The challenge to Sri Lanka is to provide for a comprehensive ecosystem for the delivery and sustenance of quality mediation services. This requires many things – a legal regime that adopts universally accepted principles; a judiciary that appreciates the vision; infrastructure that meets with international standards; service providers of excellent quality; awareness by stakeholders of the distinguishing features that offer benefits of value and very importantly policy acceptance at the highest levels of Government. It is the country that will benefit from better and smarter dispute resolution options. A push from the private sector alone is inadequate

Sri Lanka ratified the UN Convention on International Settlement Agreements Resulting from Mediation, popularly known as the Singapore Convention on Mediation, last Thursday on 28 February. This Convention is to Mediation what the 1958 UN Convention On Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (the NY Arbitration Convention), is to Arbitration.

Legislation to give effect to the Convention was enacted by the Sri Lankan Parliament in January, 2024 and is titled ‘Recognition and Enforcement of International Settlement Agreements Resulting from Mediation, Act No. 5 of 2024’. The Act will come into force and the Convention will apply to Sri Lanka with effect from six months from the date of ratification, i.e. from 28 August 2024.

UNCITRAL’s work was a response to a need for a uniform framework to enforce mediated international agreements. Mediation was becoming popular as a commercial dispute resolution method and uniformity of cross border arrangements was a dire need. The UN Convention recites in its preamble that mediation is increasingly used in international and domestic commercial practice as an alternative to litigation and that the use of mediation results in significant benefits such as reducing the instances where a dispute leads to the termination of a business relationship, facilitating the transaction of commercial business and producing savings to States in the administration of justice.

The Convention applies to settlement agreements that are the result of mediation; are international in nature at the time of the entering into the agreement; resolve a commercial dispute, and are in writing.

The enactment of domestic legislation and the ratification of the Convention will contribute to Sri Lanka offering an improved dispute resolution regime that will be attractive to investors and to business partners engaged in cross border trade and business. Importantly, it signals to investors that Sri Lanka has a universally accepted regime for the enforcement of international mediated settlement agreements. Efficient contract enforcement is vital to attract foreign investment and to facilitate domestic commercial activities.

This development comes at a time when Sri Lanka’s dispute resolution regime is unattractive. Riddled with delay, expense and unpredictability litigation is a nightmare. These weaknesses that were predominantly a feature of litigation has crept into the practice of Arbitration as well, with a few exceptions. In past years Sri Lanka struggled to improve its ease of doing business performance with no success. The scene is however changing.

The Sri Lankan scene is however changing due to private sector efforts to introduce mediation for higher value commercial and other civil dispute resolution. The International ADR Center, Sri Lanka (IADRC) was established in 2018 to provide ADR services including Arbitration and Mediation for commercial dispute resolution. It is currently engaged in training Mediators and also training Lawyers in Mediation Advocacy with donor assistance from The Asia Foundation (TAF) and the UNDP through funding from the EU’s Support to Justice Sector Project (JURE) and with support from the Commercial Law Development Programme (CLDP) of the Department of Commerce, USA,. The USAID has supported mediation for private sector dispute resolution, through its Efficient and Effective Justice Activity (EEJ). The IADRC is also supported by the JURE project and private sector corporates to maintain infrastructure of international standards at their Centre located at the WTC, to provide mediation services in compliance with its own Rules or other Rules opted for by disputants. The donor support is extremely valuable in introducing mediation to the commercial community and awareness programs are held in the provincial commercial capitals as well.

Currently, legislation is being prepared to establish a legal regime for mediation of civil and commercial disputes. The envisaged law will provide for principles and standards that will apply when parties refer disputes to mediation voluntarily to private mediators, and seeks to ensure quality and integrity of the mediation process. The law will not establish Boards or provide for mandatory reference to mediation. Although institutionalised Mediation for the resolution of minor community disputes has been available since 1988, there is no legal regime for mediation in respect of higher value commercial and other civil disputes outside of State managed Boards. The new law will fill

The universal buzz about mediation stems from the benefits the process offers. Mediation is a non adversarial process, where a third party (the Mediator) facilitates better communications and understanding between disputants to identify their interests and decide on how those interests can be satisfied. The Mediator has no power to impose a solution. There is no judgment of past actions and omissions nor a determination of right and wrong. Rather, it is a process that helps disputants identify and satisfy their needs and interests. The role of the Mediator is extremely important and hence proper training is vital. The mediation process is informal but disciplined and structured and disputants engage directly with the Mediator and with each other. Lawyers play a role which is distinct from that of the adversarial Lawyer in litigation. Mediation advocacy is starkly different and requires a different focus that supports a settlement. Confidentiality of matters discussed is ensured and is a key feature of the process. All statements made during the process are made without prejudice ensuring that concessions made and proposals submitted are not permitted to be used against the party making them in any other dispute resolution process. The independence and neutrality of the Mediator is ensured through an obligation to disclose real or perceived conflict of interest situations. Party autonomy is ensured in several ways. The disputants have the discretion to select the mediator; disputants stay in mediation only if they wish to and have the option to leave at any time if dissatisfied with any aspect; disputants enter into a settlement agreement only when fully satisfied that the terms and conditions are acceptable to them; until disputants place their signature to a settlement agreement nothing is binding.

A mediated settlement agreement is as valid and binding and enforceable as any other written agreement between parties. It is a myth that such an agreement is not enforceable. Breach of any obligation in a settlement agreement can either be mediated again or enforced as a breach of a contractual obligation in a court of law. It is well known that the instances of breach is very insignificant given that such an agreement is the result of consensus reached through a process that affords the opportunity for a full, fair and exhaustive discussion of issues, concerns and interests. Mediation is a smart business option.

In addition to the work of UNCITRAL, other International Organisations are expanding their services to include mediation to resolve disputes and to adopt Institutional rules. Some of these initiatives are the following:

The International Bar Association – adopted Investor-State Mediation Rules in 2012.

The International Chamber of Commerce – adopted its Mediation Rules in 2014.

The World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) – adopted its Mediation Rules in 2021.

The International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) (World Bank group) – adopted its Mediation Rules in 2022.

The European Parliament and the Council – adopted Directive 2008/52/EC on ‘Certain aspects of mediation in civil and commercial matters’ in May 2008.

The challenge to Sri Lanka is to provide for a comprehensive ecosystem for the delivery and sustenance of quality mediation services. This requires many things – a legal regime that adopts universally accepted principles; a judiciary that appreciates the vision; infrastructure that meets with international standards; service providers of excellent quality; awareness by stakeholders of the distinguishing features that offer benefits of value and very importantly policy acceptance at the highest levels of Government. It is the country that will benefit from better and smarter dispute resolution options. A push from the private sector alone is inadequate.
