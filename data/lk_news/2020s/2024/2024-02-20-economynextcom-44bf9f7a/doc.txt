Sri Lanka consults EU team on data protection action plan

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Technology met with data protection consultants from the European Union to discuss a strategic plan for the country’s data protection authority, this week (19).

“Met with a team of consultants representing the European Union’s Enhanced Data Protection & Data Flows project. The meeting aimed to share strategic learnings from the EU with Sri Lanka’s Data Protection Authority,” State Minister Kanaka Herath said on his Facebook page.

Tamar Kaldani and Dr Aaron Martin, representing the EU project, shared insights on data protection best practices and regulatory frameworks established in the European Union, Herath said.

“This knowledge exchange is crucial as Sri Lanka strives to strengthen its own data protection regime.” The nation is at a nascent stage in regulating data privacy of its citizens.

Sri Lanka’s Data Protection Authority was established following a gazette issued by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in July 2023.

The State Minister requested the team “to provide a robust action plan and operational blueprint complete with measurable milestones, empowering the Ministry to track progress effectively,” adding “This transparency and clear roadmap ensure accountability and pave the way for a robust data protection framework in Sri Lanka.
