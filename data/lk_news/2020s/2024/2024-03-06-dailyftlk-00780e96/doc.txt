Revitalising Sri Lanka: NPP’s vision for innovation leadership

Amidst the ongoing economic crisis, Sri Lanka ranked 85th in the Global Innovation Index (GII) 2022, bringing to light several areas pertaining to innovation in which the country has progressed, and also several areas that need to be improved. The GII 2022 report could be used as a starting point to pay more attention to innovation in entrepreneurship, investments, businesses, social changes, and also in the overall economy, which, in the current economic context, could make a significant positive change.

With an eye on the next five years, the NPP envisions a country that not only competes but excels in innovation on the global stage. The party is resolute in its goal to secure a position within the top 50 ranks of the Global Innovation Index, showcasing the determination to transform our nation into a hub of cutting-edge advancements.

A cornerstone of the NPP’s strategy is a substantial increase in funding for Research and Development (R&D). Currently standing at 0.13% of the GDP, the party pledges to boost this figure to an impressive 2.5% within the initial five years of governance. This commitment underscores a recognition of the pivotal role R&D plays in fostering innovation, driving economic growth, and ensuring sustainable development.

The roadmap outlined by the NPP emphasises the need for a comprehensive approach towards innovation. Beyond financial commitments, the party aims to create an environment conducive to creativity and progress. By fostering collaboration between academia, industry, and the public sector, the NPP envisions a synergy that will unlock the full potential.

Expanding on the commitment to innovation, the NPP lays out a visionary plan for the agricultural sector. Recognising the critical role agriculture plays in the nation’s economy, the party pledges to integrate Research and Development (R&D) and cutting-edge technology into agricultural practices.

In line with the NPP’s commitment to increase overall R&D funding, a significant portion will be allocated specifically for agricultural research. The party understands that fostering innovation in agriculture is paramount to ensuring food security, boosting productivity, and mitigating the impact of climate change on the sector.

The NPP envisions the integration of technology into agriculture, bringing forth a new era of precision farming, data-driven decision-making, and sustainable practices. By leveraging international best practices and collaborations, the party aims to equip farmers with advanced tools, ensuring the sector’s resilience and contribution to economic growth.

Central to the NPP’s agricultural vision is the empowerment of farmers. The party aims to bridge the technological gap by providing farmers with access to information, market insights, and modern tools. This empowerment is not only a commitment to the sector’s growth but also a step towards elevating the livelihoods of those at the heart of Sri Lanka’s agricultural landscape.

The NPP’s commitment to innovation extends beyond traditional sectors, encompassing agriculture as a key pillar for economic growth. By emphasising Research and Development and technology integration, the party positions Sri Lanka to not only climb the ranks in the Global Innovation Index but also to cultivate a resilient and technologically advanced agricultural sector.

In summary, the NPP’s vision for innovation encompasses both the broader economic landscape and specific sectors like agriculture. By addressing the need for increased R&D funding and embracing cutting-edge technology, the party aims to steer Sri Lanka towards a future of innovation-led growth and sustainability.
