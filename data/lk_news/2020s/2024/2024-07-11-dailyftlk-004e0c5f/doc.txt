Vijitha Herath demands halt to arbitrary spending by provincial Governors

Emphasises need for Governors to be answerable to Parliament for their actions

National People’s Power (NPP) MP Vijitha Herath has called for an immediate halt to the extravagant and arbitrary spending by provincial Governors, highlighting the lack of adherence to any circulars or laws. Speaking in Parliament yesterday, Herath criticised Governors in certain provinces for appointing advisors and making decisions without proper oversight.

“Governors in the Western Province, in particular, are making decisions without considering any circulars or laws, especially during the final phase of the Government,” he said. Herath pointed out that millions of rupees are being spent on various items, including vehicles and the setting up of Vesak and Poson zones, without any established mechanisms.

He emphasised that these arbitrary actions must be stopped immediately, warning that if they continue, the Governors will have to answer to Parliament for their actions.
