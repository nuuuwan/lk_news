Sri Lanka expects IMF staff level agreement by Nov 23: President

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka hopes to sign a staff level agreement with the International Monetary Fund by November 23, Sri Lanka’s President Anura Dissanayake said.

“We hope to reach a staff level agreement with the IMF team in the island by November 23,” President Dissanayake said addressing the inaugural convening of Sri Lanka’s tenth parliament on Thursday.

Sri Lanka will work within the parameters of the IMF plan, the president said. “The economy has to be managed with extreme care [siyumva].”

A budget will be presented to parliament in February and passed by mid-March 2025, he said.

An IMF program usually requires a budget in line with its parameters.

The economy cannot bear many shocks and it has to be carefully handled, he said.

Sri Lanka hoped to conclude sovereign bond restructuring by December.

There no point in debating whether a better deal could be reached, and it would have taken more time, President Dissanayake said.

Sri Lanka also expected to conclude these agreements with the bilateral creditors, he said. (Colombo/Nov21/2024)
