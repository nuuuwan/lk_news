Rs. 10 lakhs sponsorship for a kidney transplant every month

Melstacorp PLC, one of the largest and most diversified Sri Lankan conglomerates under the leadership of business tycoon Deshamanya Harry Jayawardena, has introduced a groundbreaking Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative through the Urology and Kidney Transplant Center at Melsta Hospitals Ragama â€“ wherein Melstacorp will sponsor 10 lakhs rupees (Rs.1,000,000) every month for a deserving kidney patient undergoing Kidney transplantation at Melsta Hospitals Ragama.

The sponsorship, worth Rs. 10 lakhs, offered to a selected deserving patient every month, can effectively cover over 30% to 35% of the total surgery and related costs. An independent committee will meticulously evaluate and select the most deserving patient each month based on the financial background and the impact of the surgery on the individual and their family. The selected patient will receive sponsorship upon approval by the Ministry of Health to carry out the Transplant according to the Government approved protocol.

Over the recent past, Sri Lanka has witnessed a surge in kidney-related health concerns, leading to an increased demand for kidney transplant surgeries. Unfortunately, the financial burden associated with this complex procedure has made it challenging for many patients to pursue the life-saving treatment, exacerbated by economic conditions impacting government healthcare services.
