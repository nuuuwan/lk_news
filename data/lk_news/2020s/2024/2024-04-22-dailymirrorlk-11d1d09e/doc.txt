The Iran-Israel conflict leaves Lanka at crossroads - EDITORIAL

Israel’s misguided (as the US President chooses to call it) attack on the Iranian Consulate in Syria, the retaliatory strikes by Iran on Israel and counter-strikes by Israel on Iran have set West Asia (referred to as the Middle East by the US and the West) in flames. By these actions, the taboo against direct attacks on each other has now disappeared.

If there is another round-a conflict over Iran’s nuclear advances or another strike by Israel on Iranian military officers- both sides will feel free to launch direct attacks on the other.

Relations reached a point of no return on April 1, 2024 when an Israeli air strike destroyed the Iranian Consulate annex building in Syria killing 16 people, including a senior Quds Force Commander.

For centuries, diplomatic premises have been afforded special protection and are considered part of that particular country within the host nation. Attacks on diplomatic compounds carry particular weight, both in law and in the popular imagination. The Israeli airstrike was therefore an insolent cock-a-snook attitude and a challenge to Iran.

While Israel itself did not comment on the bombing, the Western press was quick to look for loopholes to excuse Israel for what was an act of international terrorism.

On 15 April the anticipated Iranian retaliation materialised. Waves of Iranian drones and missiles flew towards Israel. The US and a few of its allies among Muslim nations in the region, helped stop a majority of drones and missiles before they reached their targets.

The West was also quick to condemn the Iranian action. EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell said in a post on X, “ The EU strongly condemns the unacceptable Iranian attack against Israel...”

US President Biden vowed a G-7 response and iron-clad US support for Israel.

UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on his X account claimed “Iran has once again demonstrated that it is intent on sowing chaos in its backyard,” The US and UK imposed a new wave of sanctions against Iran, following its drone attack on Israel.

Unlike some media which imposes views on its readership, this newspaper presents facts as they happen and leaves it to our readership to form their own opinions.

What is of greatest importance, is how the escalation of conflict between Iran and Israel will affect our country. It is important therefore we recognise who our friends are, and make informed decisions to benefit our people.

Iran has been an old and dependable friend of Lanka. Most recently in a situation where our country has not been in a position to repay its foreign debts because of insolvency, Iran agreed to settle our $251 million debt via a barter agreement under which we supply Iran tea in exchange for oil and gas in monthly installments of $5 million.

Iran has also helped several development projects in our country.

In 2010 it agreed to post US$450-500 million for the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project and a 90-100 megawatt hydroelectric power plant around the Central Province.

Iran has also invested in Sri Lankan Oil refineries. The investment has helped  double Lanka’s oil production capacity.

Iran has also been one of our country’s main buyers of tea. When exports fell due to US sanctions on Iran hitting trade, to by-pass US sanctions, Iran purchases our tea via the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Iran has also invested in rural electrification. These projects according to Wikipedia have made Iran one of our largest aid donors.

During the civil war, Iran made covert loans at low interest to help Sri Lanka purchase electronic surveillance aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles after the daring attack on the Sri Lankan Air Force by the LTTE. Iran also invited selected Sri Lankan officers for training during the war.

In contrast, Israel boasts it provided PT boats for coastal patrol and training to our forces. What is less known is Israel at the same time trained LTTE cadres and provided them with anti-PT boat equipment to use in fighting government forces!

Former Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky, in his book ‘By Way of Deception’ made these sensational revelations in 1990.

It leaves us wondering, why in more recent times Lankan governments have openly supported Israel in its genocidal war against Palestinians and moved away from other Gulf states.
