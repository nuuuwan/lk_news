NPP says AKD ready for Presidential debate by Daily Mirror

Colombo, April 8 (Daily Mirror) - National People’s Power (NPP) MP Harini Amarasuriya said that the NPP is ready to accept the invitation made by the Daily Mirror to host an open debate with the three main presidential candidates.

Addressing the media, the NPP Leader was ready to accept the invitation and members attached to the NPP economic council have participated in a number of debates in the recent past where various details were highlighted.

However, with the presidential elections approaching, the NPP proposed that the debate should include only presidential candidates.

"If this is not feasible, we are prepared to engage in a debate with economic council members from all political parties," MP Amarasuriya said.

Yesterday, the Daily Mirror and Lankadeepa extended an invitation to the three main presidential candidates—Ranil Wickremesinghe, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and Sajith Premadasa—for a live presidential debate on their economic and political policies and their pledges to move the country forward if they win the upcoming presidential election scheduled to be held in October.
