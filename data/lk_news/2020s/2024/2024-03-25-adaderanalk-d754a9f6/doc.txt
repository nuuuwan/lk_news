Price of a cup of milk tea reduced

The price of a cup of milk tea has been reduced by Rs. 10, the All-Island Restaurant Owners’ Association announced today.

This decision has been taken as a result of the government’s decision to reduce the price of imported milk powder with effect from midnight yesterday (24), it said.

On Sunday, Minister of Trade Nalin Fernando said that the price of a packet of milk powder weighing 1 kilogram will be reduced by Rs. 150 while the 400 gram packet will be reduced by Rs. 60.
