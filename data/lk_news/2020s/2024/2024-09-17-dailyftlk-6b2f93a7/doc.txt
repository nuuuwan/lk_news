Pelwatte Dairy Industries reinforces commitment to safety and environmental sustainability

Dairy Industries Ltd., a leading name in Sri Lanka’s dairy industry, hosted a successful press conference to outline its strengthened commitment to promoting a culture of safety and environmental sustainability. The press event emphasised the company’s dedication to fostering a safe workplace while ensuring that its operations align with both local and international standards for health, safety, and environmental protection.

As part of its overarching safety strategy, Pelwatte Dairy has adopted ISO 45001, the global standard for Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S). This certification establishes a framework to enhance employee safety, reduce workplace risks, and create better, safer working conditions. The main objectives under this standard include promoting a safety culture by encouraging leadership and employee participation, ensuring legal and regulatory compliance with local laws such as the Factory Ordinance and international standards like those from the International Labour Organisation (ILO), and preventing workplace injuries through robust risk assessments aimed at achieving a zero-accident environment.

In addition, Pelwatte Dairy Industries highlighted its ongoing efforts to improve environmental performance through the adoption of the ISO 14001 framework. This internationally recognised standard provides a structured approach to managing and reducing environmental impact, enhancing sustainability across the company’s operations. In line with the ISO 14001 objectives, Pelwatte Dairy is committed to preventing harmful environmental impacts through diligent impact assessments. The company integrates sustainable practices across its operations by optimising resource use, reducing waste, and improving energy efficiency.

The FSSC (Food Safety System Certification) is another critical framework adopted by Pelwatte Dairy, ensuring that all products meet global food safety standards. The company also promotes a culture of continuous improvement in food safety practices through regular assessments and audits, ensuring that their operations consistently meet international standards.

Pelwatte Dairy Industries Ltd. Managing Director Akmal Wickramanayake emphasised the need for leadership to take charge in setting safety standards and for employees at all levels to actively participate in creating a safer workplace. “At Pelwatte, we believe that safety is everyone’s responsibility. By encouraging leadership, fostering employee participation, and prioritising continuous improvement, we aim to embed safety into the core of our operations,” stated Wickramanayake. “Our goal is simple but critical – zero accidents and a hazard-free environment. Safeguarding the environment is a priority at Pelwatte Dairy, not just for compliance but as a key part of our sustainable growth strategy. As we expand into export markets, maintaining these high standards will ensure we remain competitive globally while upholding our commitment to safety and environmental responsibility. Pelwatte’s commitment to FSSC reinforces consumer and business partner confidence by maintaining the highest levels of food safety and regulatory compliance.”

Assistant Manager – SHEQ (Safety, Health, Environment, and Quality) Chaminda Lanka, echoed these sentiments, adding, “We actively engage with every employee to make sure safety practices are fully integrated into their daily routines. Our focus is to create an environment where safety becomes second nature.” He further emphasised that risk assessments are the cornerstone of their safety initiatives, allowing them to proactively identify and manage occupational health and safety risks.

The company reaffirmed its commitment to meeting both local and international health and safety standards, including the Factory Ordinance and the ILO guidelines. General Manager – Manufacturing Lasantha Silva stated, “Adherence to both local and international safety regulations is a cornerstone of our operational strategy. By ensuring compliance with the highest standards, we not only protect our employees but also set an example of responsible business practices in the dairy industry.” Senior QA Manager Shashikala Madakumbura, further emphasised the need for aligning safety practices with quality management: “Our quality assurance systems are designed to not only meet regulatory standards but also to proactively identify and mitigate potential risks that could impact the well-being of our employees or the quality of our products.”

Pelwatte Dairy is also focused on ongoing improvement in its environmental performance, resource efficiency, and pollution reduction efforts. “Continuous improvement is part of our DNA,” said Lasantha Silva. “We are constantly exploring new ways to reduce our environmental footprint, whether it’s through energy efficiency, waste reduction, or resource optimisation. Our commitment to ISO 14001 pushes us to strive for excellence in everything we do.”
