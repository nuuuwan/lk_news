SJB vows to thwart President’s election delay tactics

SJB’s Sujeewa Senasinghe accuses President Ranil Wickremesinghe of resorting to political tricks and manipulations to delay polls

Claims Palitha Range Bandara’s proposal to delay elections is strategic manoeuvre orchestrated by Wickremesinghe

Assures SJB will vigorously oppose any attempts to delay Presidential Election

Dismisses rumours of potential collaboration between SJB and UNP ahead of polls

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Head of Presidential Election Operations Sujeewa Senasinghe asserted yesterday that the party would firmly resist any attempts by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to manipulate the electoral process.

Speaking at a press briefing in Colombo, Senasinghe accused Wickremesinghe of relying heavily on political manoeuvres and deceptive tactics throughout his three-decade-long political career.

He criticised the President for his alleged inability to engage in politics without resorting to such strategies, particularly highlighting Wickremesinghe’s recent collaboration with United National Party Secretary Palitha Range Bandara.

Senasinghe interpreted Range Bandara’s recent proposal as a ploy by President Wickremesinghe to assess the feasibility of postponing the elections. He emphasised that as the election draws near, Wickremesinghe’s reliance on political tricks would likely backfire. Senasinghe said the SJB would not allow any delays to the Presidential Election, asserting that Wickremesinghe’s motivations stem from his recognition of his dwindling public support and a desire to secure an alternative path to Parliament.

“The Presidential Election must be held. A large number of people are currently waiting to join the Samagi People’s Force. Accordingly, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya is committed to winning all upcoming elections and bringing positive change to the country,” he said.

Asserting the necessity of holding the Presidential Election as scheduled, Senasinghe expressed confidence in the Samagi Jana Balawegaya’s ability to attract widespread support, emphasising their commitment to bringing about positive change in the country.

Furthermore, Senasinghe dispelled rumours of potential collaboration between the SJB and the UNP before the elections, affirming their party’s independent stance. He emphasised that the SJB refuses to align with a faltering political entity, highlighting their skilled leadership and the potential to lead Sri Lanka towards progress by rooting out corruption and fraud.

However, Senasinghe warned of ongoing efforts aimed at undermining the strength of the united people’s force, signalling a need for vigilance and unity within the SJB.
