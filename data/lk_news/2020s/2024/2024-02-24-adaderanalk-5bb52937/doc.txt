CBSL officials summoned by parliamentary committees over 70% salary hike?

Several parliamentary committees have decided to summon Central Bank officials to inquire into the legal basis of the substantial salary hike granted to its employees.

Recent media reports revealed that the Central Bank had increased the salaries of its employees by 70% and the move was heavily criticized by both parliamentarians of both the ruling party and the opposition.

In light of the situation that stirred much controversy in the country, Central Bank officials have reportedly been summoned by several parliamentary committees.
