At the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Organisation of Professional Associations (OPA) on 30 October, Institute of Supply and Materials Management (ISMM) President Jayantha Gallehewa was elected uncontested as the President-Elect of the OPA.

This appointment underscores the confidence the OPA has in Gallehewa’s longstanding commitment to Sri Lanka’s professional community. Serving as Vice President over the past few years, he has contributed significantly to the OPA for over eight years, representing the ISMM and serving in various leadership roles.

Gallehewa will become the 45th President of the OPA for the term 2025/2026, following his active involvement in the organisation’s General Forum and Executive Council since 2018. With his extensive experience and vision, his leadership is anticipated to guide the OPA in advancing initiatives that support both the professional community and Sri Lanka’s broader development goals.

Founded in 1975, the OPA serves as the apex body of 52 professional member associations representing 34 professions, including medicine, law, accountancy, engineering, supply chain, software engineering, and management. The OPA’s mission is to harness the expertise and skills of its members to foster the growth of these sectors and support national development.

Through this collaborative approach, the OPA addresses critical challenges, bolsters economic progress, and strengthens service quality across Sri Lanka’s industries.

Gallehewa’s upcoming term as OPA President-Elect is expected to be a transformative period, with an emphasis on elevating professional standards and positioning the OPA as a driving force in Sri Lanka’s development.
