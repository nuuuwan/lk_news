Health sector trade unions to launch strike tomorrow

At least 72 health sector trade unions, excluding doctors’ unions, will launch an island-wide strike from 6.30 a.m. tomorrow (01 February), demanding the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance.

Although the President had promised to hold talks with them regarding the allowances, soon after returning from his recent official overseas tour, the health workers said they have yet to meet with the Head of State for discussions.

However, the All Ceylon Nurses’ Union has decided not to join the strike action to be launched jointly with over 72 health sector trade unions on Thursday.

The members of the union stated this, after meeting the Chief Prelate (Mahanayake Thero) of the Malwathu Chapter regarding the current situation of the health sector.

Commenting further regarding the matter, the All Ceylon Nurses’ Union alleged that this decision was taken since the planned strike action is a conspiracy by the government.

They also mentioned that nevertheless, the authorities were informed regarding their demands and that the relevant authorities requested a period of one month to act on the relevant demands. The union further stated that they will resort to a trade union action if no response is received for their suggestions and demands.

On January 08, the Cabinet of Ministers gave the approval to President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s proposal to double the DAT allowance paid to government doctors, raising it from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000.

Since then, the health sector employees’ trade unions representing a wide range of health sector professionals, including radiology and laboratory technicians, pharmacists and drug compounders, midwives, dental surgeons, public health inspectors, and entomology officers launched strikes on multiple occasions in protest of the government’s decision and demanding an allowance increase for all health sector employees.

On January 23, the government decided to temporarily half the payment of DAT allowance for doctors citing insufficient funds. Director General of Health Services Dr. Asela Gunawardena stated that although the necessary arrangements were made for the payment of the said allowance, the Treasury had not provided funds within the approved allocation limit.

This prompted the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) to announce the launch of an indefinite strike action starting January 24. However, it was later called off the planned trade union action, after the decision to suspend the DAT allowance payments was rolled back.
