Sri Lanka pensioners get Rs3,000 allowance ahead of polls

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka began crediting retired government servants’ bank accounts with an allowance of 3,000 rupees on Wednesday ahead of the general elections.

“Starting today, a monthly interim allowance of Rs. 3,000 will be credited to all pensioners’ accounts. Pensioners with bank accounts will get it today, while those using post offices can access it from the 18th,” President Anura Dissanayake said on X.

The Treasury has allocated the required amount to the Department of Pensions, the president’s media division said.

“The Treasury Operations Department has provided an allocation of Rs. 2,021 million for 679,960 pensioners this month.”

Sri Lanka’s general election to select 225 representatives is scheduled for November 14, with postal voting beginning on October 30.

A cabinet decision in August by the previous government to provide the allowance to pensioners was halted by the Election Commission. (Colombo/Oct16/2024)
