Michelle Obama emerges as top contender to replace Biden

US, Feb 28 - According to a survey, Michelle Obama, the former first lady of the United States, is the front-runner to succeed President Joe Biden as the Democratic party’s presidential nominee.

In the Rasmussen Reports polls, nearly half of the Democratic voters stated that they would like someone other than Joe Biden to run for US President.

When asked if they were in favor of the party “finding another candidate to replace Joe Biden before the election in November,” 48% of Democrats responded in the affirmative, while 38% disagreed. Merely 33% of Democrats think there will be a change in the ballot.

Michelle Obama received almost twenty percent of the vote among the candidates vying to replace 81-year-old Joe Biden. The other candidates included Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, California Governor Gavin Newsom, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and Vice President Kamala Harris.
