Heroes and villains

Sri Lanka’s battle against corruption reminds us of the animated fantasy comedy, Shrek—of all things—wherein the eponymous ogre’s best friend, Donkey, marries a dragoness and fathers a litter of ‘dragon-donkeys’. We have seen numerous knights in shining armour embark on crusades to slay the dragoness of corruption during the past so many years, but they have opted for a polyandrous union with it and produced fire-breathing orators that dupe the public while living high on the hog.

The Committee on Public Finance (COPF) finds itself in a quandary. Twelve out of its 14 members are opposed to its report on the online visa scam. COPF Chairman Dr. Harsha de Silva presented the report to Parliament the other day, revealing some glaring irregularities in a deal the government cut with a foreign firm without following the established procedure. The report is an indictment of the entire government. Naturally, the COPF members representing the SLPP and the UNP have taken exception to the report which, they claim, contains many errors. They have said it is unacceptable. That, in our book, is all the more reason why it will be acceptable to the public. Sri Lankans usually do not believe or accept anything unless it is denied or rejected by the government in power.

History is said to repeat itself. The current SLPP-UNP combine has done to the COPF report on the online visa scam something similar to what Dr. de Silva and some other Yahapalana MPs did, in 2016, to the second COPE (Committee on Public Enterprises) report on the Treasury bond scams. In a bid to create doubts in the public mind about the credibility of the COPE report and dilute its content, they had a slew of footnotes incorporated thereinto. They stopped short of rejecting the COPE findings and recommendations out of hand for fear of incurring public opprobrium. The Joint Opposition members, who are currently in the SLPP, defended that COPE report to the hilt, and they included the likes of Aluthgamage.

The COPE, under JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti’s chairmanship, ensured that its report did not jeopardise the interests of the then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The JVP and the UNP were on very intimate terms at the time so much so that the former had no qualms about backing the latter  vis-à-vis an attempt by the SLFP and the Joint Opposition to wrest control of Parliament in 2018. One of the lead orators of the SJB at present, stooped so low as to obtain a court order, in 2015, preventing the first COPE report on the bond scams from being made public. President Maithripala Sirisena dissolved Parliament before that COPE report was tabled as he feared that it would ruin the UNP’s chances of winning the 2015 general election, and his bete noire, Mahinda Rajapaksa, would make an early comeback.

Today, the Joint Opposition heroes have become villains and the Yahapalana villains have become heroes!

Thus, we have politicians playing cops and robbers, reversing their roles when governments change. They have reduced good governance to a mere political slogan. Doomed is a nation dependent on such characters to rid itself of corruption.

The members of the current Parliament often raise privilege issues and demand action against public officials, politicians, journalists and others for contempt of Parliament. But nothing constitutes a bigger affront to the dignity of Parliament than some of its members’ disgraceful conduct. Last year, the SLPP MPs defended the then Minister Keheliya Rambukwella when a no-faith motion was moved against him over the procurement of low-quality medicinal drugs and medical equipment, but today a case has been filed against Rambukwella over the procurement of a consignment of fake immunoglobulin. Those who tried to cover up corrupt deals under the Yahapalana government are offering to liberate the country from the clutches of the corrupt. No wonder public disillusionment with Parliament is palpable and anti-politics on the rise menacingly.

The SJB and the JVP/NPP would do well to realise that the people’s loathing for the incumbent regime does not imply their love for the Opposition full of hypocrites.
