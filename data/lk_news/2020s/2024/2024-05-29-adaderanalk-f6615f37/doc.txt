Court extends injunction against Maithripala Sirisena

The Colombo District Court has extended the interim injunction issued preventing former President Maithripala Sirisena from functioning as the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), until June 12.

The order was issued when the plain filed by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was taken up for consideration once again before Colombo District Judge Sandun Withana today (09).

The Judge had then ordered to extend the relevant injunction until June 12.

Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, in her complaint, states that as per the constitution of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), former President Maithripala Sirisena has no legal right to function as the Chairman of the party.

Therefore, the plaint was presented requesting an enjoining order preventing former President Maithripala Sirisena from functioning as the SLFP chairman.
