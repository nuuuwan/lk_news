Apple iPhone is now an obsolete product

TIMESOFINDIA, Jun 1 - Apple has added iPhone 5s, iPhone 6s, iPod touch, and 2015 iMac to its list of obsolete products, following the 7-year distribution cutoff. These devices won't receive updates or service from Apple.

Apple has added three new devices to its list of obsolete products. Launched back in 2013, Apple iPhone 5s is now obsolete worldwide. Along with iPhone 5s, the Cupertino-based company has also added sixth-generation iPod touch and 2015 edition of the 21.5-inch iMac to the list.

Apple explains that “Products are considered obsolete when Apple stopped distributing them for sale more than 7 years ago.” In other words, the device tagged as obsolete will not be eligible for any updates.

In addition, Apple will not repair or service them at all. In fact, service providers cannot order parts for obsolete products.

Apple launched the iPhone 5s in September 2013. TouchID built on the Home button was one of the key features on the device. The smartphone was equipped with A7 chip – Apple's first iPhone chip with 64-bit architecture.

In April this year, Apple added iPhone 6s to the obsolete product list. Here’s a list of iPhones that are considered obsolete worldwide: iPhone
