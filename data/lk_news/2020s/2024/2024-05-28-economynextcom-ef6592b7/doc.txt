Elon Musk to visit Sri Lanka at the end of this year: Ruwan Wijewardene

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will welcome Elon Musk later this year, Senior Adviser to the President on Climate Change Ruwan Wijewardene said.

“When we introduce Starlink and welcome Elon Musk to Sri Lanka, this would open the door to more billionaires coming into the country,” Wijewardene told reporters on Monday.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe met Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, at the recently concluded 10th World Water Forum in Bali, Indonesia.

“Elon Musk stated that the project would require the President’s support. In response, President Wickremesinghe assured him of full support to initiate the project in Sri Lanka. Musk also mentioned that he plans to visit Sri Lanka at the end of this year to start the project,” Wijewardene said.

“We have to show that we are confident in getting Starlink,” Wijewardene said. “And that Sri Lanka is a place for global projects and more investments. Once that is finished, we can introduce SpaceX.”

“Attracting investments from renowned businessmen like Elon Musk will significantly contribute to the country’s economic development. Launching such a project in Sri Lanka would signal to the world that the country is open for business, potentially attracting other millionaire entrepreneurs to invest in Sri Lanka.”

Starlink has now expanded to 99 countries, including the Maldives and Indonesia.

Wijewardene said joining a project like Starlink could provide internet facilities to underserved areas of the country, and will support the growth of various economic sectors, including tourism. (Colombo/May28/2024)
