‘Harak Kata’ produced before courts

Notorious underworld figure Nadun Chithaka Wickremeratne, alias ‘Harak Kata’, was produced before the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court on Monday morning (11 March).

The criminal is currently detained in the custody of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), after he and his infamous accomplice Salindu Malshika alias “Kudu Salindu” were arrested in Madagascar on 01 March 2023 in a joint operation by the INTERPOL and Malagasy law enforcement authorities and Customs officials.

The duo was brought back to the island on March 15 after Malagasy defence officials informed the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry of the arrest of 8 suspects including the two Sri Lankan underworld figures. .

The extradition process had been coordinated by the Sri Lankan High Commission in Victoria, Seychelles, as Sri Lanka does not have an embassy or a high commission in Madagascar.
