Fishermen arrest: PMK to picket Sri Lankan Consulate in Chennai

Condemning the arrest of Tamil Nadu fishermen by the Sri Lankan navy, PMK president Anbumani Ramadoss has announced that the party will stage a protest at the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commission in Chennai on October 8.

In a statement, Anbumani said that since June 16 after the fishing ban ended, as many as 404 fishermen have been arrested.

“As many as 54 boats have been seized. In total, 192 boats were impounded and 162 fishermen remain in Sri Lankan prisons. Due to the arrests, families of fishermen are suffering, “ he said.

Saying that the State government only writes letters to the central government seeking action, Anbumani added that during the protest, the party will demand the release of fishermen and their boats.

“The sea between India and Sri Lanka is narrow and fishermen from both the countries cross the sea border to fish. Also, fishermen are requesting to allow them to fish in the traditional fishing grounds. But, the Sri Lanka navy arrests Tamil Nadu fishermen, who are within the boundary,” he alleged.
