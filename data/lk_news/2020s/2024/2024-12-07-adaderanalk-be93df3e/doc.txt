Former airman arrested at BIA with Rs. 3m in smuggled cigarettes

Officers of the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) have seized a large consignment of smuggled foreign cigarettes valued at around Rs. 3 million, and arrested a suspect at the BIA early this morning (07).

The suspect, a 37-year-old former Air Force airman from Pothanegama, Anuradhapura, had returned to Sri Lanka from Dubai on a FitsAir flight at 12:35 a.m. today.

He had reportedly traveled to Dubai on a tourist visa in search of employment but was unsuccessful.

Upon his arrival, Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) officers discovered a total of 100 cartons containing 20,000 sticks of foreign-manufactured cigarettes concealed in his two luggages.

The suspect was released on police bail and is scheduled to appear before the Negombo Magistrateâ€™s Court on December 18 to face charges of illegal importation, smuggling, and possession of contraband cigarettes.
