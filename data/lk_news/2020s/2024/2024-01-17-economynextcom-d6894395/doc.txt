Sri Lanka discusses economic ties, EDR with India envoy

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s State Minister of Finance met with the Indian High Commissioner Santosh Jha to discuss cooperation on economic concerns.

“Engaged in fruitful discussions on fostering mutual economic partnerships between our two countries, collaborative initiatives aimed at enhancing economic ties and progress on debt restructuring process,” State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe said on X.

So far India has executed over a billion US dollars of projects in the island.

Investors from India, Jio Platforms Ltd and Pettigo – a unit of Reliance industries, have expressed interest in buying Sri Lanka Telecom. India’s Airtel already has a mobile unit in Sri Lanka’s telecom sector.

India is already involved in the country’s ports sector. The Adani group is building a container terminal in Colombo Port.

Sri Lanka blocked a Chinese power sector investment in the North, reportedly under Indian pressure.

The government has also temporarily halted foreign research ships after strong security concerns raised by neighbour India after the visit of two Chinese research vessels.

Political analysts say India has influence in the Sri Lankan election given it is closely connected with ethnic minority Tamils especially those who came down to the island nation from India as plantation workers during the British rule. India is involved in many housing projects for this group.
