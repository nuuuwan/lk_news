Sri Lanka to teach Japanese, Chinese, Korean in schools, but teachers in short supply

ECONOMYNEXT- Sri Lanka wants to introduce more foreign languages to the school curriculum to make it easier for school leavers to get jobs, but there is a shortage of teachers, State Minister for Education, Aravindh Kumar, said.

Sri Lankans are already seeking jobs in Japan and Korea where local language skills are a requirement.

“We are planning on introducing foreign languages such as Japanese, Chinese and Korean in order to create jobs for local people,” Kumar said to reporters Friday.

“When I met with the Japanese ambassador, he said he will give Sri Lankans jobs with a salary of 500,000 in Japan, however, they must know Japanese language.”

Sri Lanka, however, does not have enough foreign language teachers.

Sri Lanka has lost more than 5,000 teachers, after the latest currency collapse, according to reports.

Sri Lankan teachers are paid low salaries. At Sri Lanka’s salary scales with depreciating rupee, it is not possible to recruit foreign teachers.

Kumar said that the ministry wants to teach children foreign languages at school level so that they may study it at university and then go on to become foreign language teachers.

State Minister of Higher Education Suren Ragavan, has said that Sri Lanka plans to recruit foreign volunteers to teach English. (Colombo/Mar08/2024)
