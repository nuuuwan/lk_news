Former Minister of Sports and estranged Government MP Roshan Ranasinghe

Former Minister of Sports and estranged Government MP Roshan Ranasinghe yesterday maintained that the Parliament elected in 2020 is the most corrupt to date.

Ranasinghe, who has served in three parliaments, said, “These sentiments may discomfort some individuals, but they need to be articulated. Among the three parliaments I have been part of, the one elected in 2020 stands out as the most corrupt.”

Speaking at a discussion organised by the Piripun Sri Lanka organisation in Colombo on the Strategic National Plan for the Development of the Country, former Minister Roshan Ranasinghe highlighted flaws in the current system.

He pointed out that the current public administration system is weaker compared to that of the 1970s. Ranasinghe emphasised the necessity of strengthening public administration, stating, “We cannot progress without enhancing the effectiveness of our public administration.”

Addressing the gathering, National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa also expressed his apprehensions about the current system.

He likened the situation to a house on fire being robbed, emphasising that those who have profited from the corrupt political system fail to recognise its flaws or the potential future risks.

Weerawansa cautioned against external entities waiting to exploit the crisis and urged all parties to take responsibility for Sri Lanka’s well-being.

Meanwhile, Freedom People’s Congress member MP Charitha Herath highlighted the challenge of translating strategic plans into action. He emphasised that while strategic plans may be formulated, there is a serious issue in implementing them, with the country facing difficulties in putting ideas into action amid the ongoing crisis.

Addressing the gathering, Mawbima Janata Party leader Dilith Jayaweera remarked that the current juncture presents an opportune moment to chart a new path for the country. He stressed the importance of formulating an economy capable of withstanding regional competition to propel Sri Lanka forward. Jayaweera emphasised the necessity of a change in the political narrative as a national imperative at this critical juncture.
