‘A priest like no other’

It was about 40 years ago that I first visited the Gangaramaya Temple and met ‘Podi Hamuduruwo’. By then my wife, Shanti, had donated to the Temple a large Swarovski Lotus to be used to display the relics. The priest said that this was the first time that the temple – despite its long existence- received a valuable crystal item but soon thereafter the temple began to receive gifts of a similar magnitude which he described as an ‘auspices phenomenon’.

Over the years we became close friends and exchanged many ideas about the country and religion. Almost on every such occasion he shared his thoughts on what he could do for the country and I said that I would be happy to assist in such ventures to the extent possible. We constructed four rooms at the Kataragama Pilgrims rest and contributed monthly funds to feed the pilgrims who stayed there free of charge. We also had the rare and good fortune to undertake the annual Katina pinkama.

Podi Hamuduruwo had many unique and rare qualities. Even when he was busy talking to VIPs, he would make it a point to ensure that visitors to the temple unknown to him were given an opportunity to be blessed with the Relic Chamber kept on their heads and pirith thread tied to their hands. School children who came just before examinations were given pens blessed by the monks.

He was outspoken when circumstances demanded that he should fight injustice. He feared no politician. I recall him telling me that when Vijaya Kumaratunga was jailed and kept in a cell without any windows to get any sunlight, he requested President J R Jayewardene that Vijaya must be shifted immediately to another cell before he became blind and his request had been granted within minutes. He was a trouble shooter and some leading businessmen and politicians sought his intervention to amicably settle disputes with those in power. I am personally aware that many from different walks of life who requested a favour ever left the temple without relief or assistance.

Podi Hamuduruwo had a knack for organizing mass scale events- not only the annual Perahera but even smaller but worthwhile events like donating funds to construct toilets in 1,000 rural temples all over the country. The technical vocational college was upgraded and thousands of children benefitted by attending diploma level classes. He arranged for three promising priests of the temple to study in India to obtain Ph.Ds and I was told by him to take care of them as I was then based in New Delhi. We invited them home, along with other Sri Lankans, for alms givings and assisted them financially to buy books and as the priests often recall were even gifted with Parker pens to be used to write their examinations.

Sri Lanka is blessed to have thousands of priests but he stands tall among them for the reason that day in and day out his main concern was what he can do for Buddhism and the country. He never ran out of good ideas and executed them expeditiously to perfection. His reputation was known well beyond the shores of this island and I recall once a priest in Ho Chi Minh City asking me why we use the term ‘Podi’ when he was quite tall!

I guess as Buddha has preached old or bad karmic forces spare no one. We went to Singapore twice to see him when he had a massive stroke and was hospitalized there. We took with us the Feng Shui Medicinal Buddha statue and handed it over to him for speedy recovery. He held it with both hands and tears started dropping from his eyes. Though his condition improved marginally he never recovered fully; but as he departed his face had a glowing and serene look.
