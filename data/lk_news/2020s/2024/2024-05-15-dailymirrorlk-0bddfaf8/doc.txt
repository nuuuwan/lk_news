Court allows Duminda to present facts in case against Wijedasa’s appointment

The Colombo District Court today granted permission to Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Parliamentarian Duminda Dissanayake to present facts regarding an injunction order challenging the appointment of Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe PC as the SLFP Chairman.

The decision on whether the court will issue an enjoining order will be delivered tomorrow (16).

President's Counsel Romesh de Silva appearing for Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe raised objections challenging the maintainability of the plaint since the Kaduwela District Court has already issued an order preventing all factions from disrupting Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe functioning as the party Chairman.

President's Counsel Chandaka Jayasundere, representing Duminda Dissanayake, argued that the order issued by the Kaduwela District Court would not have any effect on this particular case.

Accordingly, Colombo District Court Judge Sandun Vithana announced that the order regarding the enjoining order will be delivered tomorrow morning.

The plaintiff Dissanayake is seeking an enjoining order preventing Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe PC and Attorney-at-Law Keerthi Udawatta from functioning as SLFP Chairman and party Acting General Secretary respectively.

The plaintiff is further seeking a declaration that all decisions taken during an executive committee meeting held on May 12 this year are not valid in law.
