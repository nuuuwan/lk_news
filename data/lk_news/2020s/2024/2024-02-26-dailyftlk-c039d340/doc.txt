SriLankan Airlines clarifies delays

SriLankan Airlines yesterday clarified that the delays experienced by its passengers at the check-in counters in Bandaranaike International Airport during the early hours of Sunday, were caused by temporary, unplanned operational conditions at the airport and not due to any type of trade union action.

“The check-in counter operations have been stabilised and returned to normal as of now. SriLankan Airlines would like to apologise to any passengers inconvenienced by these operational delays, while the airline continues to monitor the situation and take steps to avoid a recurrence,” the carrier said in a statement.

In a related development, the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation said SriLankan Airlines scheduled to fly from Katunayake to European, Asian and Middle Eastern countries on 24.02.2024 and 25.02.2024 have been delayed for more than 8 hours. The Ministry said it will hold a media conference on the same today.
