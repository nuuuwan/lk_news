Mujibur reveals 80 Govt. Ministers and MPs preparing to leave SL on 21 September

Says SLPP MPs who initially supported President Ranil Wickremesinghe are now facing a difficult situation

Describes Wickremesinghe as having a dual personality which has led SLPP members to distance themselves from his campaign events

Alleges Wickremesinghe has been forced to cancel 22 campaign rallies due to a lack of attendance by key speakers

Claims UNP members have abandoned Wickremesinghe and are now supporting Sajith Premadasa

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Mujibur Rahman has revealed that at least 80 Government Ministers and Parliamentarians have secured visas to leave Sri Lanka on 21 September, the day of the upcoming Presidential election.

Speaking at a press conference yesterday, Rahman said Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MPs who initially supported President Ranil Wickremesinghe are now facing a difficult situation.

“They thought supporting him would ensure an election victory. However, they now see him as having a dual personality, like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,” Rahman remarked.

He added that many SLPP members are distancing themselves from Wickremesinghe’s campaign events as a result.

Rahman further claimed that Wickremesinghe has been compelled to cancel 22 rallies, with several key speakers no longer attending his events.

“They now see his true nature. At least 80 frontbenchers have acquired visas to leave the country on 21 September. They realise Ranil Wickremesinghe is not their protector. They feel they are being used to pave the way for Anura Kumara Dissanayake to win,” he said.

Rahman also mentioned that United National Party (UNP) members are no longer supporting Wickremesinghe. “They are all now aligned with Sajith Premadasa. The UNP’s legacy rests with the SJB, and all communities in Sri Lanka are rallying behind Sajith Premadasa,” he concluded.
