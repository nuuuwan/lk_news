Protesting health workers claim over-time

Colombo, Feb 19 (Daily Mirror) - The health sector workers who staged a protest at the National Hospital, Colombo (NHC) today demanding the removal of the National Hospital's Deputy Director, had reportedly signed for overtime payments.

When contacted, Deputy Director Dr. Rukshan Bellana claimed that more than 200 health workers attached to the NHC, Eye Hospital, Dental Institute Colombo, Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) and De Soysa Hospital for Women had come to the NHC and protested.

He also claimed that these health workers had signed four hours of overtime (OT) for the protest period up to today and said that they had taken the free meal provided at the government hospitals.

"Claiming OT for protesting hours and getting the free meal is illegal, and I request that higher authorities take necessary action against them," Dr. Bellana said.
