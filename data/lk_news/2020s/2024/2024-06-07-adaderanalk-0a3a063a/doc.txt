As the crescent moon for the month of Dhul Hijjah (Hajj) has been sighted, Muslims in Sri Lanka will celebrate the Hajj festival (Eid-Ul- Adha) on 17 June 2024, the Colombo Grand Mosque announced today.

The sighting of the moon marks the beginning of the Islamic month of Dhu Al-Hijjah, during which the Hajj pilgrimage is performed, and is followed by Eid-Ul- Adha.

Hajj, one of Islamâ€™s five pillars, is the pilgrimage to Makkah in Saudi Arabia that every Muslim must make at least once in their lifetime if they are able.
