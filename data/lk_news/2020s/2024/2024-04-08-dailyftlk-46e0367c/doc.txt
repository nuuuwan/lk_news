SJB accuses JVP of avoiding economic debate challenge

Says JVP is resorting to making various claims and statements to evade a face-off

Stresses that regardless of polls a party’s core economic policies must remain unchanged

Claims JVP is uncertain of its own economic policies and is thus evading a debate

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Deputy General Secretary Mujibur Rahman yesterday criticised the rival Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) for sidestepping the challenge posed by the SJB economic council to engage in a public debate on the economy between the two parties.

Instead, he said the NPP is resorting to making various claims and statements in an attempt to evade a face-off with the SJB.

Speaking at a press conference in Colombo, Rahman emphasised that regardless of the upcoming elections, a party’s core economic policies must remain unchanged.

“Instead of embracing the challenge presented by the SJB, the JVP is issuing various statements to evade it,” he remarked, suggesting that this reluctance may stem from the JVP’s uncertainty regarding its own economic policies.

“The JVP General Secretary asserts that the JVP’s economic policy aligns with the Compass’s (National People’s Party) policy. If that’s the case, why establish a separate entity like the NPP? It appears they are struggling to advance under the JVP banner. Hence, they’ve introduced the compass. They’re attempting to alter red into pink to gauge public acceptance,” he commented.

“When it comes to discussing the economy, the JVP tends to evade the subject,” he stated. “The JVP appears to be intentionally avoiding this topic, possibly because its policies and philosophy lack realism. They seem hesitant to openly share their stance with the public,” he added.

However, despite Rahman’s claim, SJB MPs Harsha de Silva and Nalin Bandara specifically issued the challenge for a public debate to the economic council of the NPP, which includes members Sunil Handunnetti, Prof. Anil Jayasinghe, and Seetha Bandara, rather than the JVP.

In response, Handunnetti accepted the challenge on behalf of the NPP and said however the party was keen to hold a debate between the leaders of both parties instead of between the economic councils. He requested the SJB to formally extend its invitation to the party in writing, which it has failed to do yet.

He claimed it was futile to engage in debates with SJB members, citing their previous involvement as policymakers under the United National Party (UNP) and their current affiliation with the SJB.
