Sri Lanka’s tuk tuk drivers to be registered, issued QR code

ECONOMYNEXT – A database containing details of tuk tuk (three-wheeler) drivers will be introduced and drivers will be issued a QR code, Sri Lanka’s Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment has said.

Manusha Nanayakkara met with drivers at the ministry where “It was discussed to prepare a data system containing the details of three-wheelers and to introduce a related QR code, and to prepare a system which can find trip for three-wheelers through the internet,” a statement by the government information department said.

However, most taxis operating in Sri Lanka find indirect ways to avoid paying for such already established systems, such as Uber and PickMe.

Also discussed at the meeting was the need for a ‘professional council for three-wheeler drivers’ to ensure professionalism and a social security system for the drivers. Until this is established, an interim sectoral steering committee would be appointed for the taxi drivers.

Sri Lanka has over a million registered three-wheelers, but research showed less than half of that number were operating as taxis.

In 2022, during Sri Lanka’s fuel crisis, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera estimated that according to registrations at provincial and divisional secretaries, there are only 350,000 commercial tuk tuk drivers in the country.

A proposal by the three-wheeler drivers regarding the development of their professional dignity was presented to the Nanayakkara. The minister said he will consider gazetting the proposals under the new Employment Act. (Colombo/Jan17/2024).
