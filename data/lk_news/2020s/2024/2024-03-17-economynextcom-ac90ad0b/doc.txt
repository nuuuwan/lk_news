Sri Lanka negotiating PPA for J/V solar power plant with India’s NTPS

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is negotiating a power purchase agreement with a joint venture solar power company with India’s National Thermal Power Corporation in Sampur, Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said.

“The Sampur project power purchase agreement we are hoping to sign this year,” Minister Wijesekera told reporters last week.

“The negotiations are ongoing in the modalities. It is not an India project per se, 51 percent of the company is with the CEB. We are looking forward to signing the power purchase agreement and starting construction immediately after that.”

However some infrastructure developments, including a transmission line has to be done in parallel, he said.

“So we are looking into different financial institutions. We have had discussions with AIIB, to finance part of it,” Minister Wijesekera said.

NTPS is expected to build a solar plant of around 135MW in Sampure in Trincomalee in two stages. A plan to build a 500MW coal plant was scuttled by anti-cola activists. (Colombo/Mar17/2024)
