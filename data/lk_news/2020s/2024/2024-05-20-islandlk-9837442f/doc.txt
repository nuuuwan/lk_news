As a responsible industry stakeholder, committed to excellence, we believe it is our duty to give back to the community. Initiatives such as this donation to the new Ambulatory Care facility of the NHSL is one way we are achieving this objective. Ultimately, we wish to realize a future where every Sri Lankan has access to the highest quality compassionate healthcare, helping to create a healthy and robust society.”
