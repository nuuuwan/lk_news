Possibility of floods on Kelani, Kalu Ganga if 100mm rain received today

May 26 (Daily Mirror) - The water levels of in the upper areas of the Kelani and Kalu Ganga have reached caution levels due to the higher rainfall in the catchment areas of these rivers, the Irrigation Department's Irrigation (Hydrology) Director Eng. S.P.C. Sugeeshwara Bandara said.

He said the water levels in these rivers have reached caution levels for the first time soon after the north-east monsoon started.

Specially those living along the upper areas of the Kelani and Kalu Ganga closer to the Ratnapura district are requested to be vigilent of sudden floods, he said.

There are possibilities of sudden floods in these areas if rains of 100mm continue, Bandara said.

However, due to heavy rains in the Sabaragamuwa and Western Provinces and the Galle and Matara districts in the Southern Province and certain areas in the North-Western Province, the water levels in these areas prevail at higher level, he added.
