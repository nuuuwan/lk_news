Night of signature Christmas tunes

The famous Billy Fernando, of 2FORTY2 fame, and his talented wife, Devashrie, will present ‘A Classic Christmas’ on 1st December, at the Bishop’s College Auditorium.

Together, they will deliver an enchanting repertoire of Christmas classics, merging languages and styles.

The evening will evoke the spirit of Christmas through music and an engaging theatrical vibe.

The music will be directed by Billy himself, with a lineup of versatile musicians, to create the envisioned sound for this show.

The evening’s entertainment will include such favourites as ‘Santa Baby,’ ‘Santa Claus Is Coming To Town,’ ‘Blue Christmas,’ ‘Long Time Ago In Bethlehem,’ and many more.

Yohani Senevirate, who now resides in London, and a close friend of the 2FORTY2 star, mentioned to us that Billy and Devashrie got married recently.

Yohani went on to say that she was there for the 2FORTY2 show, held in London recently, and “Wow! I enjoyed it thoroughly.”
