Indian Navy ship ‘Kalpeni’ visits Colombo

Indian Navy’s ship, INS Kalpeni, arrived in Colombo today (19), according to a statement issued by the High Commission of India.

The High Commission noted that the ship was warmly welcomed by the Sri Lanka Navy in accordance with naval traditions. The Commanding Officer, Commander Sunil Kulhari will call on Commander, Western Naval Area, Rear Admiral Chinthaka Kumarasinghe during the stay.

INS Kalpeni is a Car Nicobar class Waterjet FAC of the Indian Navy commissioned on 14 October 2010. The ship is named after Kalpeni Island in the Lakshadweep group of Islands. The ship is based at Kochi with the primary role of Coastal Surveillance and Defence.  The ship specialises in anti-smuggling, Vessel Boarding Search & Seizure as well as Search & Rescue operations.

The ship is on a port call from 19-21 October 2024, termed as Operational Turn Around. The ship has brought in essential technical support tools, which will be handed over to Sri Lanka Navy. In addition to taking in replenishment, the ship’s crew will visit places of importance in and around Colombo, the statement added.

It may be recalled INS Kabra, similar class of ship, visited Colombo in January 2024 and handed over spares to Sri Lanka Navy and Airforce. Visits by Indian Navy & Coast Guard ships and submarines aim to achieve bonhomie and interoperability between the two neighbouring navies.

The High Commission further stated that this visit further strengthens the bilateral cooperation and camaraderie between the two Navies in keeping with India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy and the Prime Minister’s vision of ‘SAGAR’ which stands for “Security and Growth for all in the Region”.
