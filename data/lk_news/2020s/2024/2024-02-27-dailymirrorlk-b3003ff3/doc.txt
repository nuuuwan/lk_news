Rats on board ground SriLankan flight

Colombo, Feb 27 (Daily Mirror) - Rats were found on board a SriLankan Airlines aircraft on Sunday, forcing the authorities to delay flight, SriLankan Airlines Chairman Ashok Pathirage said yesterday.

“We had to spray a chemical to an aircraft in which rats were found and ground it for one day as per the international standards,” Mr. Pathirage told a discussion which was held at Ports, Shipping and Aviation Ministry.

Two other aircraft had to be delayed due to technical defects,” he added.

Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation Nimal Siripala then questioned as to whether any investigation was done to determine as to how the animals managed to creep into the aircraft.

It was also revealed that the absence of 15 ground handling staff also caused the delay. Three members of staff have applied for leave on Sunday, while the remaining 12 have kept away from work casually. “Sack those who kept away from work without applying for leave,” the angry minister said.

Mr. Pathirage said there are only 20 aircraft in the Srilankan Airlines fleet while three aircraft have been grounded. “We are to purchase five A 330 Aircraft, but that has become an issue with the global demand for airlines and because of Sri Lanka’s economic situation,” he said.
