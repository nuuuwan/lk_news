Sri Lanka ISB restructure deal needs OCC nod: IMF

ECONOMYNEXT – The International Monetary Fund said it welcomed Sri Lanka’s deal with international sovereign bondholders but still required clearance from the official creditor committee of bilateral lenders.

“We welcome the announcement of an agreement in principle between Sri Lanka and international bondholders’ representatives, subject to confirmation on comparability of treatment by Sri Lanka’s Official Creditors Committee,” an IMF spokesperson said.

“This represents significant progress in Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring process.”

The revised restructure terms were arrived at after consultations with the IMF “to ensure that the agreed terms were fully compatible with the Debt Sustainability Analysis of the program, the Finance Ministry said at the time.

The revised proposal was made “following an iterative process with IMF staff at technical level” and also took into account feedback received from the OCC on the July deal, Sri Lanka said.

Following the agreement Sri Lanka’s government changed at Presidential elections. (Colombo/Sept24/2024)
