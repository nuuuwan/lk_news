Sri Lanka July 2024 remittances rise 10.3-pct to $566.8mn

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s remittances coming gained 10.3 percent to 566.8 million dollars in July 2024 compared to the same month last year, helped by more expatriates using the official banking channels.

“Remittances from Sri Lankan overseas workers reached USD 566.8 million in July 2024, bringing the total for the first seven months of the year to USD 3.71 billion,” State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe said on X (twitter).

“This represents a 10.3% increase compared to the same period last year, underscoring the vital role of our expatriate community in supporting and strengthening the economy.”

Worker remittances is one of the top foreign exchange revenue earners for the island nation which is still recovering from an unprecedented economic crisis.

Semasinghe thanked former Minister Manusha Nanayakkara for his “support and dedication to the welfare of our overseas workers, which has greatly contributed to this positive trend.”

The remittances have risen continuously after the central bank gave up a parallel exchange rate regime, which compelled most expatriates to switch informal Undiyal and Hawala money transfer methods. (Colombo/Aug12/2024)
