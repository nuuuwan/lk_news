Two more SLFP members switch to SJB

Two more Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) stalwarts crossed over to the main opposition party, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) yesterday following a series of similar crossovers since the beginning of 2024.

Accordingly, former SLFP provincial council members have now joined hands with the main opposition party. Thilakasiri is also the Homagama electorate organiser for the SLFP.

The duo met with SJB leader Sajith Premadasa and expressed their support to the party. They joined Premadasa at the 100th phase of the SJB’s ‘Sakwala’ Program, which involves donating digital screens and computers to State schools. This event took place at Boralesgamuwa Maha Vidyalaya.

The first crossover took place in January when SLFP MP Shan Wijayalal de Silva joined the SJB. He was appointed as its Ambalangoda Electoral Organiser.

A few days later former SLFP MP Dayasritha Tissera also joined the SJB. Tissera was appointed as SJB Chief Organiser for the Nattandiya electorate in the Puttalam district.
