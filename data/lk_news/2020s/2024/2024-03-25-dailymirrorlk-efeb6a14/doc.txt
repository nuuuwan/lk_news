Discarded Romanian railway carriages back for tourism

Colombo, March 25 (Daily Mirror) - With the expenditure of Rs. 5.5 million by the Sri Lanka Railways Department (SLRD), the Chief Mechanical Engineer's Sub Department Ratmalana has renovated several old discarded Romanian railway carriages as tourist railway carriages to attract local and foreign tourists.

While paying an inspection visit to the Chief Mechanical Engineer's Sub Department, Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardana said these old Romanian railway carriages have been modernized and the roof has been removed so that tourists can observe the environment and the railway track more easily.

Another compartment has been renovated completely using wood, so that tourists can observe the environment around the railway line with more comfortable seats.

It is remarkable that these old railway carriages, once unfit for service, have been refurbished by local railway engineers and technicians, adding significant value, the Minister said.

Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardena said that this institution has set a great example for the country by renovating these abandoned railway carriages in the difficult situation the country is facing today.

The Minister pointed out that this design, which was done using the engineering technology of the institute and its technicians, adds great national value.
