Emerald is no longer just about formals, says its CBO

Emerald Inte, Sri Lanka’s premier menswear brand, is redefining its legacy with its “Re-Imagine Emerald” rebranding campaign. This initiative unveils a modern new logo and repositions Emerald as a brand that delivers style for every man and every moment.

While Emerald has long been synonymous with impeccable formal wear, it’s time to reimagine the brand’s offerings. Emerald isn’t just about formals anymore—it’s about versatile menswear that adapts to the diverse needs of today’s men.

Emerald’s rebranding is not just about a new look; it’s about expanding our horizons,” said Ahmed Ikram, Chief Business Officer of Emerald International. “We want people to know that Emerald is no longer just about formals—it’s a brand that offers everything you need to create a complete wardrobe. From office-ready formals to relaxed casuals and head-turning evening attire, including Shirts, Polos, crewnecks, Denim, Utilitech Chinos, and Cotton Chinos, we have something for every man.”
