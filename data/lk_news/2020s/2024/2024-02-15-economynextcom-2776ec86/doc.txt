Sri Lanka makes identification mandatory for Aswesuma II amidst welfare fraud

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Welfare Benefits Board said the national identification card will be mandatory for those applying for the second phase of its Aswesuma program due to widespread welfare fraud.

“One of the changes we are making from the first phase is making identification compulsory,” Chairman of the Welfare Benefits Board, Jayantha Wijerathne, said at a press briefing Thursday (15).

“We could not prioritize this in the first phrase. Therefore, we had a lot of inconveniences and many people have claimed benefits multiple times.”

Welfare Benefits Board Member Kumar Dunusinghe said that in one instance, an individual had registered for benefits 109 times.

This time, the Board will collect details of the applicant’s family members including their ID numbers to prevent the same family applying for benefits multiple times.

“There have also been instances where people sell the application form,” Wijerathne said.

The registration for the Aswesuma Benefits Scheme began today (15) and will continue until March 2024. In this phase, payments will be made for up to 2.4 million people who were plunged into poverty as a result of an economic crisis. (Colombo/Feb15/2024)
