Defence Secretary warns Sri Lankan war heroes against smugglers

Colombo, May 7 (Daily Mirror) - Defence Secretary Kamal Gunaratne requested Sri Lanka's war heroes not to become victims of human smugglers who are recruiting people to serve in the armed forces on the Russian-Ukrain war front.

He revealed that Sri Lanka's war heroes are being lured by false promises to join the armed forces in the Russia-Ukrain conflict.

"These promises include offers of land in Saint Petersburg, Russian citizenship for their families and monthly salaries exceeding Rs.1 million. However, these promises remain unfulfilled, with no compensation provided for deceased war heroes and their families. Many Sri Lankan soldiers have already been sent to the conflict zone, resulting in casualties and injuries, whose extent remains unknown.

General Gunaratne clarified that these soldiers were not legally recruited but rather coerced into serving as mercenaries. He urged war heroes to avoid falling prey to these human smugglers.

Additionally, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), the Police Department and intelligence services have initiated a search operation to apprehend the human smugglers involved in recruiting Sri Lankan war heroes as mercenaries for the Russian-Ukrainian conflict.

Several smugglers have already been arrested and will be prosecuted accordingly.
