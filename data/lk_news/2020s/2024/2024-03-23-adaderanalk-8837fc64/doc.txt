Amid controversy, Maithripala clarifies basis of remarks on Easter attacks’ masterminds

Former President Maithripala Sirisena, who landed himself in hot water after claiming that he was aware of the ‘real perpetrators’ of the Easter Sunday bomb attacks, now says his remarks were based on some information he had received three weeks ago.

The ex-President stated this in response to the allegations leveled against him, following the controversial statement he made on Friday that he has knowledge of the true mastermind of the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks and that he was prepared to disclose the information to the judiciary if inquired from him or an order is issued regarding the matter.

“I made that statement yesterday based on information I received three weeks ago regarding the Easter attacks. I am prepared to testify confidentially if ordered by a court”, he said.

“I intend to provide a confidential statement. If I were to give an open testimony in court, I am aware that it could potentially jeopardize my life and even my family. Therefore, this is not merely a matter of political implications. I am making a very sincere statement”, he added.
