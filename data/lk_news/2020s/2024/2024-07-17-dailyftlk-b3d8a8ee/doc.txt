Dipped Products PLC (DPL), a global leader in the manufacturing of high-quality gloves and a subsidiary of Hayley’s PLC yesterday announced the opening of its dedicated sales and marketing office in Mumbai, India.

This strategic move is part of DPL’s ongoing global expansion strategy to enhance its presence in key markets.

Notably, the new Mumbai sales office is equipped with a state-of-the-art electrician glove testing facility, ensuring that each glove meets the highest industry standards for quality, durability and safety before reaching customers.

Having achieved a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for GDP of 7.5%, India stands as the world’s fourth largest economy and an emerging global economic powerhouse. Home to a fast-growing middle class, and a rapidly developing industrial base, that accounts for 17% of total GDP, the Indian market represents one of DPL’s most valuable growth new opportunities according to DPL Managing Director Pushpika Janadheera.

“The Indian market has consistently demonstrated resilient growth, and with the opening of our 7th marketing arm in Mumbai – joining our existing offices in Italy, Poland, France, the Middle East, Thailand, and Sri Lanka – we are now ideally positioned to serve this market. While previously we primarily served markets in North America and the Europe, since the COVID-pandemic, we have also started to secure valuable opportunities in India and many other regions, including the Middle-East, South America and Australia,” said Janadheera.

“In each of these markets we are delivering hand protection that provide maximum safety, and utility to customers, backed by an unwavering commitment to sustainable, ethical manufacturing in alignment with our ESG roadmap for 2030 – DPL Pulse, and the values, standards and targets laid out in the Hayleys Lifecode. From electric shock, chemical and cut protection of the highest standards to specialised gloves purpose-built for the EV and telecommunication industries, as well as gloves which incorporate recycled PET and other sustainable materials, we offer a wide range that helps protect against many hazards. We also aim to partner with India’s most sustainable modern retail and standalone supermarkets chains/e-commerce platforms to generate shared value for our valued customers and stakeholders,” Janadheera added.

DPL Pulse is built on the four key pillars of “Planet, People, Products and Partnerships” which ensure a holistic focus across the value chain. Aligned to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the roadmap sets out clearly defined targets under each pillar, including a 20% reduction in carbon footprint (Scope 1 and 2).

As a result of DPL’s proactive approach in adopting renewable energy sources, 93% of its energy needs are currently met by biomass and other renewable sources. Moving forward, DPL has committed to invest Rs. 1.6 billion in solar energy spanning all six manufacturing locations, with five based in Sri Lanka and one in Thailand.

Strengthening its competitive advantage in niche export markets, DPL aims to ensure that a minimum of 10% of its product portfolio is eco-rated and will increase the use of recycled raw materials in its manufacturing process by at least 30%. DPL also plans to increase the environmental screening of suppliers by 40%, in addition to doubling the beneficiaries of its CSR programs.
