Palitha of Pasdun Korale was a “Hitha Honda Chandiya”

Palitha Thewarapperuma was an unconventional politician. He was a man of action without any intellectual pretensions. He had a fierce temper and was provoked easily. He was also fearless. At the same time, he possessed a tendency to bully or intimidate people. He justified his conduct with the excuse that he was acting in the interests of the people. This was accepted by many people who felt his heart was in the right place in spite of his unbecoming conduct at times. Besides he was generally on the side of the under-privileged and vulnerable sections of society. His dedicated service to these people was genuine

In life, he was a controversial character who was mostly in the news for the wrong reasons. He was a Parliamentarian who brandished a knife against a fellow MP during a brawl in the House. He had a notorious reputation for getting things done in the way he wanted by engaging in pressure tactics often resorting to fisticuffs. He even attempted suicide once by hanging himself on a ceiling fan. Generally people outside his home district perceived him as a thug and bully who tried to browbeat others.

In death, this overall negative image of the man turned topsy-turvy. There was an outpouring of genuine grief and sorrow at his funeral proceedings. People from all walks of life in his home district mourned his untimely death. Large crowds paid their respects and attended his funeral. Political leaders and politicians of different hues marked their presence at the funeral house. Whatever his image in life, the man’s death demonstrated that he was indeed popular among the masses notwithstanding his “toughie” reputation.

I am of course referring to former Kalutara district Parliamentarian Palitha Thewarapperuma who died of accidental electrocution on 16 April 2024. As stated earlier, this United National Party (UNP) stalwart from Kalutara had a controversial negative image. Yet his funeral on 19 April and the rituals of mourning that preceded it, saw huge crowds in attendance. Palitha Thewarapperuma’a death was truly felt as a loss to the community and genuinely lamented.

Two of the action films in which my all-time favourite Sinhala film hero Gamini Fonseka acted in were “Chandiya” made in 1965 and “Hitha Honda Minihek” made in 1975. It appears that a large number of Palitha Thewarapperuma’s supporters and fans perceived him as a combination of the titles of these two Gamini Fonseka films. He is referred to as a “Hitha Honda Chandiya” or Good-hearted Strongman/thug. It seems that Palitha was essentially a good man who served the common people well. Much of the strong arm tactics he deployed too was in their interests. Hence Palitha is supposedly a Hitha Honda Chandiya. Other references are “Chandi Mahathaya” and “Chandi Pali”.

Palitha Thewarapperuma born on 3 May 1960 hailed from Yatadolawaththa, Matugama in the Kalutara district. He studied at Ananda Sastralaya, Matugama. Palitha’s grandfather had supported the UNP from its inception and had canvassed for people like C.W.W. Kannangara (father of free education) and D.D. Athulathudali (Lalith’s father) when they contested the Matugama electorate in 1947 and 1952. Though the family was regarded as die hard UNP loyalists of the “Kapuvath Kola” type, Palitha’s father had broken with this tradition in 1977 when he supported Anil Moonesinghe of the LSSP.

Palitha too followed in his father’s footsteps and associated himself with Anil Moonesinghe. He worked for Moonesinghe who contested the May 1983 by election in Matugama on behalf of the SLFP. Moonesinghe won and thereafter Palitha worked in Anil Moonesinghe’s office for a while.

Palitha however returned to his family’s UNP roots. He took to coconut cultivation and small-scale commerce for a living. Palitha began dabbling in politics as a UNP’er and became a Pradeshiya Sabha member in the nineties of the last century. Thewarapperuma was elected chairman of the Matugama Pradeshiya Sabha in 2002. Subsequently he was elected a member of the Western Provincial Council from Kalutara district in 2004 and 2009.

Contesting the April 2010 Parliamentary elections on the UNP ticket, Palitha Thewarapperuma was elected Kalutara district MP polling 51,153 preference votes. He re-entered Parliament in August 2015, garnering 118,128 preference votes. The UNP was the chief constituent of the 2015-2019 “Good Governance” Government headed by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Thewarapperuma’s happiness over the UNP victory was seriously affected by a personal tragedy. The eldest of his two sons, Sahan Thilanka died of sudden illness at the age of 23. The father never recovered from that blow. Even years after the death, Thewarapperuma would tell interviewers that he cannot forget his first-born and that everything reminds him of his lost son.

Thewarapperuma also received several deputy-ministerships during the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government period. He was first appointed Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs on 6 April 2016. After serving for two years in this capacity, Thewarapperuma was shuffled to the post of Deputy Minister of Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development on 2 May 2018.

Then came the “bombshell” of 26 October 2018 where President Sirisena sacked Premier Wickremesinghe and appointed a new Government with Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister. This idiotic move by Sirisena failed miserably. Wickremesinghe was back as Prime Minister on 21 December 2018. Thewarapperuma was re-appointed Deputy Minister of Social Empowerment in the new Government. He remained in that position until

21 November 2019 when the newly elected President Gotabaya Rajapaksa appointed a new Government with Mahinda Rajapaksa as premier.

It is noteworthy that Thewarapperuma remained steadfastly loyal to the UNP and party leader Wickremesinghe when President Sirisena replaced Ranil with Mahinda as PM. Despite many attempts to lure him into the short-lived Sirisena-Rajapaksa Government, Palitha did not budge. Later when most party MPs deserted the UNP to join Sajith Premadasa’s SJB, Thewarapperuma did not do so. He remained with the UNP and faced defeat in the August 2020 elections.

Tens of thousands of people came to mourn their beloved Chandi Mahattaya whom they regarded as a Hitha Honda Chandiya. These included very large numbers of Muslims and Tamils. Many MPs from near and far came to pay their respects. These included President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa

Palitha Thewarapperuma was an unconventional politician. He was a man of action without any intellectual pretensions. He had a fierce temper and was provoked easily. He was also fearless. At the same time, he possessed a tendency to bully or intimidate people. He justified his conduct with the excuse that he was acting in the interests of the people. This was accepted by many people who felt his heart was in the right place in spite of his unbecoming conduct at times. Besides he was generally on the side of the under-privileged and vulnerable sections of society. His dedicated service to these people was genuine.

There was a time when Palitha displayed chauvinist tendencies. He abused a Tamil youth from Bulathsinhala who had rubbed him the wrong way as a “Para Demala” and made him kneel on the road in public for hours. He was quite hostile to Tamils and Muslims at one time. However to his credit Thewarapperuma changed for the better as time progressed. He began enjoying amicable relations with the Tamils and Muslims in Kalutara.

This in turn brought the minority communities in the area closer to Palitha. He went out of his way to help them. It may be recalled that Thewarapperuma was of great assistance to the afflicted Muslims in Kalutara after the Bodu Bala Sena instigated anti-Muslim violence in Aluthgama and Beruwela. He was assaulted by Sinhala mobs for trying to protect Muslims and came to Parliament with visible signs of his injuries.

Likewise Palitha was very helpful to the Muslim people during the COVID-19 times. He ensured that they got adequate food and medicine.

Thewarapperuma also looked after the interests of Tamil estate workers in Matugama also. The Tamils and Muslims in Kalutara district voted in large numbers for him. Their regard for him was great. Tamils and Muslims together make 3.94% of Kalutara district population according to the 2012 census.

One of the most bizarre incidents involving Thewarapperuma was the incident concerning school admissions to 10 children. Palitha took 10 children and their parents to Meegahathenna Primary School and wanted them admitted. The Principal refused saying all new admissions had been completed. Thewarapperuma then conducted a hunger strike opposite the school with the children and families. The Principal did not relent.

On the following day Palitha returned to the school with the children, parents and supporters in tow and renewed his demand. The principal refused saying the ministry had instructed him not to admit. Palitha threatened to commit suicide but the principal took it lightly.

Palitha then rushed to a classroom in the school. He removed his shirt and unbuckled his belt. He then climbed a table, attached the shirt to the belt and put the belt tightly around his neck. The other end of the shirt was tied to the ceiling fan. Palitha then jumped off the table in a suicide bid. He suffocated and gasped for breath with flailing arms and legs. People pulled him down but Palitha collapsed and lost consciousness.

Thewarapperuma was rushed to Nagoda Hospital first but later taken to a private hospital in Colombo and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The Kalutara district MP who was then a deputy minister in the Sirisena Government sent a message to the President threatening to pull out of the Government if the children were not given school admission.

President Sirisena issued urgent instructions to education authorities who got the children admitted to another school in Matugama – St. Marys College. A triumphant Thewarapperuma went in procession with the children and their families to the school and waited until he saw the children attend classes.

On another occasion Thewarapperuma forced the reluctant principal of Kalutara Vidyalaya to admit a child to his school by embarking on a prolonged sit-in at the Principal’s office.

“Chandi Mahathaya” has been involved in several incidents of violence. Once he assaulted some members of the Agalawatte Pradeshiya Sabha and compelled them to kneel down. He was arrested and released on bail with his passport being impounded.

In another incident Thewarapperuma got into an argument with employees of a hotel in Galle and assaulted them. He then complained to the Galle Police and health department officials about sanitary conditions at the eating house. Several officials accompanied Palitha to the hotel and raised a ruckus. A powerful politician from Galle got to know about this and warned Thewarapperuma off.

Palitha’s conduct in Parliament was also deplorable at times. He was once involved in a Government-opposition MP fracas in the House. Palitha Thewarapperuma then a deputy minister engaged in fisticuffs with Prasanna Ranaweera MP. Both were suspended from Parliament for a week.

The October-December period in 2018 during which President Sirisena replaced Ranil Wickremesinghe with Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister saw law and order break down at times among MPs within Parliament. MPs were often involved in brawls. Thewarapperuma made news headlines when he brandished a knife and threatened rival MPs

Another interesting incident occurred at the Sabaragamuwa University. Thewarapperuma in his capacity as Deputy Culture Minister was scheduled to formally declare open a new Cultural Centre in the campus. But when his vehicle tried to enter varsity premises, Palitha found hundreds of undergrads blocking his entry by sitting on the road.

Thewarapperuma then clambered on top of his vehicle and sat there staring at the seated students who began hooting and jeering. The deputy minister sat on his vehicle for hours braving the scorching sun but the protesting students did not disperse. Finally Thewarapperuma gave up and retreated.

Most of these incidents concerning Palitha Thewarapperuma were given wide exposure in the media. The negative publicity depicted the man as a rustic thug without an iota of culture ingrained in him. Even though Palitha was notorious for his unorthodox behaviour, the people he represented in Parliament treated him with affection and respect. This was because Thewarapperuma worked sincerely for the betterment of the people. As stated earlier his was a voice for the voiceless and downtrodden people. His death therefore resulted in a genuine exhibition of sorrow by the people.

It is noteworthy that Thewarapperuma remained steadfastly loyal to the UNP and party leader Wickremesinghe when President Sirisena replaced Ranil with Mahinda as PM. Despite many attempts to lure him into the short-lived Sirisena-Rajapaksa Government, Palitha did not budge. Later when most party MPs deserted the UNP to join Sajith Premadasa’s SJB, Thewarapperuma did not do so. He remained with the UNP and faced defeat in the August 2020 elections

On that fateful day of 16 April, Thewarapperuma went to his 10 acre coconut grove to manure the trees. After unloading the manure bags from the lorry, Thewarapperuma stepped on a livewire that was concealed in the underbrush and suffered an electric shock. The unconscious ex-MP was taken to Nagoda Hospital but passed away. Subsequently the magistrate who visited the scene, recorded a verdict of accidental death by electrocution.

News of his demise shocked the people especially those of Pasdun Korale in the hinterland of Kalutara district. The current electoral divisions of Matugama, Agalawatte and Bulathsinhala comprise the Pasdun Korale. This Korale came into being when Parakramabahu the Great got the Kalu Ganga drained. Thewarapperuma was fond of referring to himself as “Pasdun Korale Palitha”.

Tens of thousands of people came to mourn their beloved Chandi Mahattaya whom they regarded as a Hitha Honda Chandiya. These included very large numbers of Muslims and Tamils. Many MPs from near and far came to pay their respects. These included President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa.

Palitha Thewarapperuma was laid to rest in the “Nisala Niwahana” (Abode of Tranquillity) that he himself had constructed. Having a premonition of impending death, Thewarapperuma had designed and built a tomb akin to a mausoleum on his property. The novel structure has a concrete crypt nine feet long and six feet wide. The outer area has two figures of lions at the entrance and four bare bodied warriors in the four corners. There is a large picture of a seated Palitha behind the crypt.

The body of Palitha Thewarapperuma was carried on a stretcher-like coffin also designed by him and brought to the grave/tomb. The earthly remains were gently lowered into the crypt. Thereafter the crypt was closed with a concrete slab that had been already made by Palitha and sealed. All this was done while some “Kavi” verses written by Palitha Thewarapperuma himself were recited. Thus ended the funeral of a colourful and controversial Sri Lankan politician regarded as a good-hearted strong man.
