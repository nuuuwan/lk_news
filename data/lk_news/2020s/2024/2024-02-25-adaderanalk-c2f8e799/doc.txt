CBSL requests President for opportunity to explain recent salary hike

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has requested the President, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, for an opportunity to apprise the Members of Parliament, through an appropriate Parliamentary Committee, of the process and rationale behind the recent salary hike for CBSL employees.

The written request was made by CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe.

Issuing a release in this regard, the CBSL noted that the latest revision of remuneration of the CBSL employees had been approved by the Governing Board under the triennial Collective Agreement entered into with the Trade Unions covering the period 2024- 2026.

Thus, the Governing Board, at a meeting held on 21 February, had requested CBSL Governor Dr. Weersinghe to make a written request to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, seeking an opportunity to apprise the Members of the Parliament of recent revision of remuneration of CBSL staff.

“CBSL will explain its position upon being offered the requested opportunity or on receipt of a request for information”, the statement read.
