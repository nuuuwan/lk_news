Egg traders allege unfair profits by producers

The All Ceylon Egg Traders Association (ACETA) has raised concerns about the unfair profit margins in egg production, alleging that producers are earning an excessive profit of Rs. 25 per egg.

ACETA president Anura Marasinghe stated that it currently costs only around Rs. 20 for the production a single egg.

He further explained that with the wholesale price of eggs provided from farms to traders ranging between Rs. 45 and Rs. 50, the market price of an egg has now exceeded Rs. 50.
