Sri Lanka president starts political office as polls near

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe has set up a political office, his media division said, with presidential elections expected in the fourth quarter of the year,

“The office, located on Sir Ernest de Silva Mawatha, will serve as the center for future political operations.”

Sri Lanka’s next presidential election is due to be held between September 17 and October 17 this year.

Wickremesinghe represents the United National Party which won one seat in the last general elections after a majority of its members broke away to form the Samagi Jana Balavegaya under Sajith Premadasa.

Wickremesinghe, who now heads a government led by the formerly rival SLPP, has said that the presidential election will be held before a parliamentary election.

But he hasn’t yet said definitively that he intends to contest the election, and has yet to officially announce his candidacy.

Parliamentary, provincial and local government elections will all follow the presidential election, according to Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena. (Colombo/Jun6/2024)
