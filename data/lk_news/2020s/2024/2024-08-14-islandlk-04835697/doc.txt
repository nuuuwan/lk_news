Sandun continuing his fruitful business ventures

Last year, an article titled “Sandun, Regional Expert with a New Mission in Sri Lanka” in the local media showcased his remarkable achievements and clear vision. A year later, Sandun has not only continued his journey of success but also followed his path to become an entrepreneur, a regional and global logistics leader. This follow-up article explores his past year’s progress, upcoming projects, and perspectives on the future of logistics.

Sandun’s journey began in the early 1990s in Sri Lanka. He worked with corporates such as John Keells Holdings and Aitken Spence PLC where he rose to become a General Manager in 2002, heading a joint venture in Bangladesh for five years, navigating significant challenges whilst gaining invaluable experience competing with major players.

He has established a comprehensive logistics operation in Sri Lanka and has diversified into Tourism and Property Management that will have a direct impact on the economy. Recognizing the importance of ESG initiatives, he intends to protect Sri Lanka’s natural ecosystems through sustainable and impactful projects.

Logistics industry is getting ever important with endless challenges. Sandun envisions India playing a crucial role on the global stage, impacting entire South Asia positively. Additionally, he sees growth opportunities in the Middle East, particularly with Saudi Arabia and certain GCC countries diversifying from oil dependency into other industries. He also identifies exceptional growth in certain countries in Africa and is bullish about being a part of it one day.

Sandun believes Sri Lankans have built a solid reputation worldwide in the field of international logistics, emerging as business leaders in the South Asian region. This reputation is underpinned by a unique set of skills including people management, leadership qualities, identifying cultural sensitivities, and political awareness.
