Mahela resigns as Sri Lanka consultant coach

Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) today announced that former captain Mahela Jayawardena, who served as the ‘Consultant Coach’ of the SLC, has tendered his resignation with immediate effect.

Jayawardena, during his tenure, helped implement significant changes to the structure of the national team ecosystem and the High-Performance Center, the SLC said.

“Sri Lanka Cricket takes this opportunity to wish Mahela all the best in his future endeavours and thank him for the services he rendered during his tenure,” the statement said.

Jayawardena had initially joined SLC as a Consultant Coach in September 2022 ahead of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in Australia. He was in charge of the overall cricketing element of the national teams and provided invaluable strategic support for the players and management teams at the High-Performance Center.

Accordingly, Jayawardena worked on coach and player development programs, the strengthening of domestic cricketing structures, and also focused on developing the Under 19, Development, and national teams.
