IMF staff mission team led by Peter Breuer, Katsiaryna Svirydzenka and Sarwat Jahan called on Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa at the Parliament complex on Wednesday.

The purpose of the meeting was to engage in a discussion concerning the ongoing progress of the agreement reached between the IMF and the Government.

The high-level gathering saw an extensive exchange of views on a wide array of economic, social, and political matters.

During their discussion it was pointed out that the Opposition is in agreement with the roadmap presented by the IMF to support the economic recovery process, whilst highlighting certain proposals require amendments.

The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) members present at the discussion emphasised that the prevailing economic situation could have been averted had the Government aptly responded to their earlier calls urging them to reach out to the global lender.

They further highlighted that the management of public finances should be done in a sustainable manner to save the country from bankruptcy.

Opposition MPs including Dr. Harsha de Silva, Eran Wickramaratne, Kabir Hashim, Niroshan Perera, Prof. G. L. Pieris, Dr. Nalaka Godahewa, Chandima Weerakkody, Velu Kumar and Harshana Rajakaruna also participated in the discussions.
