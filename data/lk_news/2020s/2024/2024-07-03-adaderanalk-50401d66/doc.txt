New Dutch government sworn in over 220 days after elections

The new Dutch government led by new Prime Minister Dick Schoof was officially sworn in on Tuesday at the Huis ten Bosch Palace in The Hague, more than 220 days after the general elections on November 22 last year.

Following the honorable discharge of the former government, 16 new ministers and 13 state secretaries were sworn in.

The new Dutch government consists of the far-right populist Party for Freedom (PVV), the center-right party New Social Contract (NSC), the rightist People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and the Farmer-Citizen Movement (BBB). These parties reached a coalition agreement on May 15.

“I am very much looking forward to getting to work as prime minister,” Schoof wrote on X, formerly Twitter, under a picture of him signing decrees alongside the king.

“For a safe and just Netherlands with social security for everyone. A grip on migration, dialogue, making choices and being clear about it. You can count on me,” he said.
