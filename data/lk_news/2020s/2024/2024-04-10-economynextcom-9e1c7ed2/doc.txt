Sri Lanka to recruit 2,500 teachers for English medium

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka plans to recruit 2,500 teachers to expand its English medium ordinary level classes, amidst a teacher shortage, Cabinet Spokesman Bandula Gunawardena said.

“There are 765 schools chosen to offer English medium at present,” Gunawardena told reporters on Tuesday. “We want to increase this to 1,000 schools.”

Sri Lanka has approved 4,441 English medium teachers already, and the state plans to increase the teachers to 6,500, Gunawardena said.

However, low salaries have proved to be a problem in the recruitment of teachers. These English-medium teachers will get the same salaries as other teachers in the state sector, the minister said.

“This is a problem. Because there is a big demand in the private sector for teachers in bio sciences, chemistry, physics, IT, accounts, English and foreign languages. And they are offered higher salaries than the state service.

“But there are instances where people leave better paying private sector for state jobs.” (Colombo/Apr10/2024)
