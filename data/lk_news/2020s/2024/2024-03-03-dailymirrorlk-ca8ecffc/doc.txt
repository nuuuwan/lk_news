Parents urged to cease pressure on primary school children

The pressure exerted by parents on their children during primary education from Grades 1to 5 should be stopped and the necessary environment will be prepared to reduce its competitiveness, Education Minister Susil Premajayantha said.

However, the Grade Five scholarship examination will be held in the future, he assured.

In order to evaluate students, measures are taken to evaluate their good skills by recognizing the skills displayed by children for activities outside the classroom, the Minister added.
