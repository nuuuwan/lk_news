Ex-Minister A.H.M. Fowzie given suspended sentence over misuse of ministry vehicle

The Colombo High Court has sentenced former Minister A. H. M. Fowzie for two years of rigorous imprisonment and suspended it for 10 years after he pleaded guilty over the charge of misusing a vehicle belonging to the Ministry of Disaster Management.

The court also imposed a fine of Rs.400,000 on the former Minister, when the case was taken up today (27), Ada Derana reporter said.

Former Minister Fowzie was charged over the possession and personal use of a luxury vehicle worth nearly Rs. 20 million received from the Netherlands to the Disaster Management Ministry, while serving as the Minister of Disaster Management in 2010.

Furthermore, he was found guilty of persuading the officials including the Ministry Secretary and spending nearly Rs 1 million from the Finance Ministryâ€™s funds for the maintenance of the vehicle.

However, Fowzie had pleaded guilty for the charges through his attorney, when the case was taken up for hearing today.

Later, the High Court Judge pointed out that such actions by a senior politician with 62 years of political experience cannot be taken for granted, but considering the fact that he pleaded guilty at the initial stage and that he is now an elderly person of 86 years of age, the former Minister will be given a lenient sentence.
