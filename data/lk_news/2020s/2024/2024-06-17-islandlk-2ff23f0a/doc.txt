RDB ranks first in providing most loans to women entrepreneurs under ADB’s We-Fi initiative

Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We-Fi) is a programme of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) which enables an empowering business environment for women entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka, conducted in collaboration with 13 banks.

The media was educated about this at a workshop related to We-Fi programme hosted by the ADB at the Courtyard by Marriott Colombo on 14 June 2024.

The data at the workshop showed that in expanding access to finance, the Regional Development Bank (RDB) tops the list of We-Fi grants distribution with 482 grants- a share of 31% of the total grants- thus distributing US$ 1.07 million among women entrepreneurs.

The Bank of Ceylon has distributed 327 grants – a share of 21.1% of the total grants – thus distributing US$ 1.23 million among women entrepreneurs. The People’s Bank was a distant third with 112 grants – a share of 7.2% of the total grants – thus distributing US$ 0.43 million among women-led MSMEs.

HNB, ComBank and NDB which are generally orientated towards financing established SMEs had notably taken advantage of ADB’s We-Fi by clinching the fourth, fifth and sixth place respectively in the loan distribution ranking.

Interestingly, the exceptional case here was the ComBank which reported the largest disbursement of US$ 1.31million among women entrepreneurs despite its fifth place in terms of the number of grants.
