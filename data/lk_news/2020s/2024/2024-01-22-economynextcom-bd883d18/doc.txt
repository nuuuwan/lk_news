Sri Lanka minor opposition party leader among five shot dead

ECONOMYNEXT — Leader of the ‘Ape Jana Bala’ (Our People’s Force) party Saman Perera was among five people shot dead in the southern town of Beliatta, media reports said citing police.

Police Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa had told the media that the five individuals, who had been travelling in a Land Rover Defender, had stopped for breakfast at a roadside eatery near the Beliatta interchange of the Southern Expressway when they were shot.

The Defender, which had come from Colombo, had exited the expressway from the interchange. Media reports citing SSP Thalduwa said an unidentified person who had arrived in a pickup truck just behind the Defender had opened fire on the driver of the Defender as he was getting off the vehicle, and subsequently shot the passengers.

One of the victims was leader of the Ape Jana Bala party, which was in the centre of a controversy following the 2020 parliamentary elections.

While the party failed to win a single seat at the August 2020 polls, it qualified for a seat on the National List as it managed to receive 67, 758 votes nationwide.

Perera, the party leader, wrote to the National Election Commission following the election that he was the nominee. However, the seat was later filled by Rathana Thero in December 2020, four months after the election.

In October 2021 the party expelled the monk, allegedly over his decision to vote in favour of the Colombo Port City Commission act despite the party’s decision to vote against it.

In October 2023, the Supreme Court ruled that the party’s decision to expel Rathana Thero was invalid. (Colombo/Jan22/2023)
