Russian Embassy issues statement on controversial night event in Unawatuna

In response to recent controversy surrounding a planned night event in Unawatuna, the Russian Embassy in Colombo has issued a statement condemning all forms of racial discrimination and nationalism.

It said the event in question had been organized with a “dress-code: white” theme by a group of entrepreneurs. According to unconfirmed data, however, the Embassy stated that the main promoter and the bar owners who had agreed to accommodate the party have been identified as Russian citizens.

Amidst confusion and concerns regarding entry conditions, however, the organizers had later issued apologies and clarified that their intentions were not to cause harm, and subsequently called off the event.

Issuing a statement, the Russian Embassy emphasized Russia’s firm stance against such injustices and expressed a commitment to combatting them.

Additionally, the embassy urged all Russian citizens visiting or residing in Sri Lanka to strictly adhere to the country’s laws and respect local customs.
