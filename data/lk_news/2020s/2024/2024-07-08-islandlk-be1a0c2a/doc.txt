Rights of Nature vis-à-vis Human Rights to Nature:

Since the early twenty-first century, governments and courts around the world have adopted a rapidly growing number of laws declaring that nature has rights. These laws take many forms, from local government bylaws to court decisions to national constitutions. They vary greatly in form, content, and legal effect.

Rights of Nature campaigns for aligning legal standards and principles with planetary boundaries and the law of Nature. Those campaigns include, among others, the Universal Declaration for the Rights of Mother Earth (2010), the Universal Declaration of Rights of Rivers, the Universal Declaration of Ocean Rights (UDOR), and the World Charter for Nature.

Several countries have recognised the Rights of Nature by establishing several constitutional, legislative, and judicial enactments that aim to provide legal protection for non-human entities and natural systems. By the end of March 2023, the Eco Jurisprudence Monitor documented 468 Rights of Nature (RoN) initiatives—which are efforts to adopt a RoN legal provision—across 29 countries, being more expressive in North America and Latin America, and less in Europe, Asia and Africa.

The first laws establishing legal structures that recognised the Rights of Nature were adopted by local municipalities in the United States in 2006. Tamaqua Borough, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, was the first community to enact the Rights of Nature. Since then, more than three dozen communities in the US have adopted such laws. In November 2010, the City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, became the first major municipality in the United States to recognize the Rights of Nature.

In September 2008, Ecuador became the first country in the world to recognise the Rights of Nature in its constitution. Ecuadorian constitutional provisions promulgated in 2008, recognise the right of nature to exist, persist, evolve, and regenerate. Bolivia has also established the Law of the Rights of Mother Earth in 2010.

It needs to be emphasised here that although people have been talking about “sustainable development” for decades, very little has been done to change the structure of the law to actually achieve that goal. Laws recognizing the Rights of Nature finally will codify the concept of sustainable development. They disallow activities that would interfere with the functioning of natural systems that support human and natural life.

It has become increasingly clear that fulfilling the human right to a healthy environment is unachievable without a fundamental change in the relationship between humankind and nature. Thus, implementing and fulfilling a true human right to a healthy environment is dependent on the health of the natural environment itself. The human right to a healthy environment can only be achieved by securing the highest protections for the natural environment – by recognising in law the right of the environment itself to be healthy and thrive. These are the ways to promote a holistic approach to sustainable development in harmony with nature.

The Rights of Nature should have their foundation in environmental laws, which are based on the idea that the natural world has inherent value and rights that should be recognised and protected. However, at present, their elements have no standing, and environmental laws are fragile in the context of dominant systems insofar as they somehow continue to carry the burden of neo-colonial practices and Western property relations.

While science in the late twentieth century shifted to a systems-based perspective, describing natural systems and human populations as fundamentally interconnected on a shared planet, environmental laws generally had not evolved with this shift with a similar momentum.

Many jurisdictions worldwide are now increasingly recognising and integrating the principles of earth jurisprudence into their domestic legal frameworks either through the changes in their respective constitutions, legislation, or judicial activism. The Rights of Nature are legally protected in Bolivia, New Zealand, Ecuador, India, and several American communities, ranging from Santa Monica to Pittsburgh. These new laws regarding the Rights of Nature are branching out to protect endangered species and animals. Many countries around the world, including Switzerland, Portugal, France, Columbia, and Brazil, have specified a set of obligations to the government regarding nature and its protection.

Courts in the United States, Costa Rica, and India have ruled on cases about endangered species, stopped activities that harm them, and ruled to save these populations, including the snail darter, papilla, northern spotted owl, Asian lion, and Asiatic buffalo. These judicial decisions all have the same goal— enforcing the idea that all of life has value, and should not be used as human property; humans as well as the state have a responsibility to avoid causing harm to these species.

There are several examples of landscapes that are being governed or have been protected through legal models based on the Rights of Nature, e.g. Galapagos Marine Reserve (Ecuador), Manglares Cayapas Mataje Ecological Reserve (Ecuador), Whanganui River (New Zealand), Atrato River (Colombia), Magpie River (Canada), Mar Menor ( Spain), among others. There is an increasing trend to scale up this impact globally and achieve its effective implementation, to reach a permanent transformation in our ecosystem and landscape governance for the benefit of Nature and communities.

New Zealand was one of the first countries in the world to create and pass laws acknowledging that nature is no longer subject to human ownership. The new ideology in New Zealand acknowledges the fact that people are part of nature; they are not separate from it or dominant over it. These laws emphasise nature as a rights holder, as well as the importance of human responsibilities to uphold these rights. Two pieces of legislation – The Urewera Act of 2014 and Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlements) Act of 2017 have granted legal personhood rights of Te Urewera National Park and the Whanganui River.

The Whanganui River will have its own legal identity with all the rights, duties, and liabilities of a legal person. The local Māori tribe wanted to treat the river as a living entity instead of treating it as property with others having ownership over it. Since the river has been granted legal recognition, if someone wants to harm the river, this would be the same as harming the particular local tribe.

Likewise, Te Urewera National Park owns itself and has legal standing, similar to the Whanganui River. Te Urewera is governed by a board of trustees whose mandate is to act on behalf of the National Park.

This was followed by court recognition of legal personhood for the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers in northern India. Rights of Nature legal provisions also now exist in Colombia, Mexico, and dozens of municipalities in the United States, and are being debated in a number of other nations.

In April 2018, the Colombian Supreme Court ruled that stronger efforts must be made against deforestation in the Amazon, and the country as a whole must be protected from the effects of climate change. In this ruling, the Colombian Amazon is granted personhood and thus is regarded as an entity with rights. This is the first such ruling in Latin America.

Sri Lanka is a biodiversity-rich country like New Zealand, Ecuador, Colombia, India, etc. and is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea for being located in a geostrategic position abundantly endowed with strategically important natural resources. While being at the center of the Indian Ocean Sea Lanes of Communication (SLOC) with extensive ocean and land-based mineral resources including premium grade graphite and rare earth elements, some political analysts are of the view that Sri Lanka suffers from a ‘Paradox of Plenty’ or perhaps, a geostrategic ‘Resource Curse’. This phenomenon often afflicts countries blessed with abundant natural resources, like Sri Lanka.

An imminent threat to our unique biodiversity is upon us, once more, especially during this critical period of desperate struggle to emerge from the unprecedented economic crisis, the country has undergone in recent times. Some political analysts argue that the ‘staged default’ in 2022 would enable the IMF to effectively take control of strategic geopolitical positioning by influencing Sri Lanka’s economic policy initiatives compromising its sovereignty. We will be seeing the outcome of this hard bargaining in the near future.

Sri Lanka seems to be under severe pressure to part with some of its greatest natural treasures both on land and in the sea around us under the plans being hatched during the painful process of ‘debt restructuring’ for moving towards ‘debt sustainability’. Under the prevailing law, these priceless landscapes and seascapes are perceived from a human perspective as an object of law – a natural resource or property having a commodifiable, and disposable value meant to benefit human beings.

In addition to the terrestrial landmass, the virtually unexplored and untapped Sri Lanka’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) spans around 519,000 sq. km. and is almost eight times larger than the country’s landmass. Furthermore, Sri Lanka has submitted a claim for an extended area of seabed amounting to 23 times its land mass (1.4 million sq. km.) with exclusive rights to water resources, biological wealth, and the sea bed with rich mineral resources, oil, gas, and fisheries.

It has been proposed to develop a Blue Economic strategy in existing sectors, including oil, gas wind, solar, and geothermal exploration, and in emerging sectors like deep seabed mining for minerals. The race for minerals on the seafloor, seen as the next frontier of exploration has already begun and been likened to a new ‘gold rush’. Countries like China, Russia, and India are looking to extract a range of minerals like zinc, cobalt, and copper available on the seabed in the Indo-Pacific Oceanic region. These minerals are needed for modern hi-tech industries like electronics, automobiles, and clean energy. However, seabed mining, on the other hand, can result in irreversible harm to marine ecosystems, disrupting fragile habitats and jeopardising marine biodiversity.

In order to ensure that oceans will not be ravaged for human benefit, Sri Lanka must think beyond an anthropocentric legal framework and uphold the essence of Earth jurisprudence at the earliest available opportunity to avoid any protracted legal imbroglios in the future. In the light of these looming threats to the remaining ‘natural resources’ in the Sri Lankan landscape and ocean-scape under the present property law, it is high time that we too transform from an anthropocentric to eco-centric jurisprudence as being done in other biodiverse countries.

So far, very little has been done to change the structure of law to actually achieve an eco-centric sustainable development, judging from the outcomes of Environmental Impact Assessments and subsequent legal proceedings on the sustainable use of our natural resources. Laws recognizing the Rights of Nature need to be brought in to codify the concept of sustainable development. The human right to a healthy environment can only be achieved by securing the highest protections for the natural environment – by recognizing in the law the right of the environment itself to be healthy and thrive sustainably i.e. an ecocentric paradigm shift in our legal system.

Given the considerable commercial value attached to these virtually uncharted marine natural resources, they would have been, in all probability, a vital element in the ongoing debt restructuring negotiations with diverse stakeholders as Sri Lanka stands to benefit significantly from an emerging blue economic strategy. Blue economy is defined as the sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, jobs, and social and financial inclusion, with a focus on the preservation and restoration of ocean ecosystems and the services they provide according to the existing international and national jurisdictions.

The MV X-Press Pearl disaster which caused unprecedented damage to the Sri Lankan oceans and all those who form a part of these oceans will adversely affect the ocean and marine lives for many years to come. It has been repeatedly emphasized that environmental disasters affect not only human beings but all other living and nonliving species who share the planet with them. Therefore, it is unequivocal that these nonhuman beings shall be empowered to protect themselves against anthropogenic environmental disasters.

An excellent discourse on how Earth Jurisprudence could be integrated into the contemporary legal framework in Sri Lanka to protect its oceans and ocean species has been published by Dr. Asanka Edirisinghe of General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (https://celp.cmb.ac.lk/team/mrs-asanka-edirisinghe/). She strongly underscores that the best method to empower oceans to fight against this level of pollution is the express recognition of Earth jurisprudence in the domestic legal framework. It respects oceans and ocean species as a salient and integral part of the wider Earth community, just like the man himself. Unfortunately, Earth jurisprudential principles are not comprehensively reflected in the contemporary legal framework aimed at the protection of oceans in Sri Lanka.

The environmental community should rally round Dr. Edirisinghe’s clarion call that the time has come when these crucial principles on Earth Jurisprudence must be integrated into the corpus of the contemporary law in Sri Lanka, following the examples set by the international community, to preserve oceans and all its members-the next frontier of exploitation – for the sake of all of the Earth community.
