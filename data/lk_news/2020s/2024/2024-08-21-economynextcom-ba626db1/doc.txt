Sri Lanka’s John Keells delists GDR from Luxembourg Stock Exchange

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka conglomerate John Keells Holdings Plc said it had completed the delisting of its Global Depositary Receipts Program from the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

“The process of termination and delisting of the GDR Program from the Luxembourg Stock Exchange has been completed,” the company said in a Colombo stock exchange filing.

John Keells announced on November 16, 2023 that it would terminate the captioned GDR Program, due to the relatively low number of GDR in issue and given “that they are not a significant contributor to facilitating trading in Company securities.”

Global depositary shares are issued in international markets to access investors in capital markets outside a company’s home country. They are traded and pay dividends in US dollars. (Colombo/Aug21/2024)
