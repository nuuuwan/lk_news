Janaka Ratnayake compares immunoglobulin scam to Hitler’s atrocities

Calls importation of substandard human immunoglobulin IV vials to Sri Lanka a ‘massacre’

Says since number of lives lost remains uncertain it must be treated similarly to atrocities committed by Hitler during WWII

Stresses politicians only display ‘symptoms’ of various ailments when they find themselves facing legal consequences

Presidential hopeful and former Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka Chairman Janaka Ratnayake yesterday declared the controversial scam involving the importation of substandard human immunoglobulin IV vials to Sri Lanka, a ‘massacre’.

Addressing the media, Ratnayake said the accusations against the former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella should be considered as both a fraud and a massacre.

Ratnayake noted that the Minister had facilitated the importation of the sub-standard human immunoglobulin vials without adhering to any proper procedures, subsequently administering them to unsuspecting patients in the country.

“We are uncertain about the number of lives lost. Hence, we must treat this issue similarly to a tragedy comparable to the atrocities committed by Hitler during World War II. Hitler, too, employed lethal injections to cause harm and fatalities,” Ratnayaka expressed.

“Politicians often show no remorse for involvement in fraud and corruption; symptoms only manifest when they find themselves facing legal consequences,” remarked Ratnayaka.

The signing of a public petition commenced yesterday in front of the Fort Railway Station, urging the Government to dismiss Keheliya Rambukwella from his current position as Environment Minister. The petition advocates for the removal of the implicated Minister from the Cabinet and the revocation of all ministerial privileges based on ethical principles. Several civic organisations spearheaded the petition campaign.
