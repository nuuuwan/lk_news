Sarath Fonseka slams Sajith Premadasa over alliance with Daya Ratnayake

Colombo, Jan 31 (Daily Mirror) - In the wake of Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leader Sajith Premadasa accepting the support of former Army Commander (Retired) General Daya Ratnayake, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka expressed his strong displeasure over the move.

Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka made these remarks during his participation in the protest organized by the SJB in Colombo yesterday.

Sarath Fonseka disclosed Ratnayake's significant involvement in his imprisonment back in 2010 under the administration of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Expressing his concerns, Fonseka emphasized that Ratnayake's allegiance to the SJB, particularly given his past affiliations, raises questions about the party's direction and principles.

He went on to suggest that by embracing Ratnayake, the SJB risks aligning itself with the former President, implying a compromise of its political stance.

Retired General Ratnayake, known for his prominent roles during the tenure of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, recently aligned himself with the SJB.
