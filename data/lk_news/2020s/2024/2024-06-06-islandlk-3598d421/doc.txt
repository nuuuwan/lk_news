Egg white…this week, too

Thank you for all the lovely comments that came my way regarding my egg white face masks, highlighted last week.

I also had a few queries, from readers, wanting to know whether oily skin, too, can be give the egg white treatment.

Yes, of course. In fact, this egg white face mask, with lemon juice, helps with skin toning by balancing the skin’s natural oils.

Why not try this out, as well – Egg White Face Mask for Mature Skin.

You will need 01 egg white, 01 teaspoon of castor oil, and 01 teaspoon of fresh aloe vera juice.

Apply this mixture to your face and wash after 20 minutes and pat dry your skin with a towel.

Apply the mask evenly to your face, apart from the eye area.

Follow up with a moisturizer to lock in hydration and prevent further dryness or itching.

(Apply this mask once a week or as needed to alleviate itching and irritation, providing a calming sensation for your skin)
