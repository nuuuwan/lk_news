Court denies request and grants bail considering his condition to allow him to seek treatment elsewhere

Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and two others, who were remanded over the alleged import of substandard human immunoglobulin vials, were granted bail by the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court yesterday. The suspects were released on a cash bail of Rs. 100,000 and two sureties of Rs. 5 million each. Additionally, the Magistrate imposed a travel ban on them and ordered Rambukwella to surrender his passport to the court.

Deputy Solicitor General Lakmini Girihagama, representing the Attorney General, requested that the accused be transferred to Colombo National Hospital or the National Institute of Mental Health for treatment under judicial supervision if the Prison Hospital could not provide adequate care. However, the Magistrate declined this request, granting bail instead due to Rambukwella’s medical condition. The Minister’s bail comes just 10 days before the crucial Presidential Election.

Rambukwella was arrested on 2 February by the Police Criminal Investigations Department. In October 2023, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) disclosed that forged documents had been used for Customs clearance to procure a batch of human immunoglobulin vials that later failed quality tests.

Before Rambukwella’s arrest, seven others were detained in connection with the alleged drug procurement scam. The fifth accused was subsequently released on bail. Those arrested include the former Health Secretary, former Additional Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministry’s Medical Supplies Division (MSD), and three other MSD officials, as well as the owner of the company alleged to have supplied the substandard vials.

Former Medical Supplies Division Deputy Director Dr. Thusitha Sudarshana, was released on bail on 6 May. Additionally, on 25 July, the Court of Appeal ordered the release on bail of former Medical Supplies Division Director Dr. Kapila Wickramanayake.

Currently, 12 suspects have been arrested in the case, with all but one released on bail. The first accused, Sudath Janaka Fernando, owner of the company that supplied the substandard drugs, is receiving treatment while under remand custody.
