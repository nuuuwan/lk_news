O/L exam subjects to be reduced to 7: Minister

The current number of subjects for the GCE Ordinary Level (O/L) examination will be reduced to seven subjects, Education Minister Susil Premajayantha said.

Addressing the media he said the remaining three subjects will be taken to evaluate the industry and environmental knowledge that can be provided to the students locally.

In such a way no child fails in the O/L and in the Advanced Level (A/L) examinations, he said.

He also said steps have also been taken to prepare the necessary background to get professional training in the subject areas that show the childrens preferences and skills.

Out of the 3,37,000 students who sat for the A/L this year, arrangements have been made to provide training in English, IT and guidance to 50,000 students.

This training programme will be held in 300 centres across the country from March 5, the minister added.
