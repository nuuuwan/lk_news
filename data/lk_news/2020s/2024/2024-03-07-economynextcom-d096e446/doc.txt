Sri Lanka needs stray dog solution before animal rights law: Min

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka needs a solution to its stray dog population urgently, before any animal rights bills are introduced, the State Minister of Defence said in Parliament.

“No one is paying attention to the problem of stray dogs. According to data we have, there are 6.2 million strays in the country,” Premitha Bandara Tennakoon said in Parliament on Thursday during an adjournment debate on ‘Damage caused to crops by wild animals’.

Tennakoon said this was a problem to the tourism industry, especially around Sigiriya.

The government plans to bring in animal welfare laws. “Before we bring in any law to prevent harming animals we have to find a solution to this problem,” Tennakoon said without specifying.

Sri Lanka’s street dog population has sky-rocketed as most dog-owning families disregard sterilization and end up dumping puppies on to the streets.

Prior to the No Kill policy enacted in 2006 by then President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the law permitted street dogs to be rounded up and gassed to combat rabies. (Colombo/Mar7/2024)
