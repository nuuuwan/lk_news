Gotabaya’s book is an attempt to paint image of innocence: National Unity Alliance

Colombo, March 10 (Daily Mirror)- The book released by Gotabaya Rajapaksa on an alleged Conspiracy to Oust him is the latest attempt by the “president who ran away” to paint an image of innocence,National Unity Alliance said.

A statement issued by the National Unity Alliance said  the seventh executive president was ousted by the people of Sri Lanka.

"The people highlighted his lack of equitable governance, his penchant for unchallenged power and his serious lack of accountability, responsibility and willingness to be portrayed as a racist apart from turning a blind eye towards corruption and the erosion of the rule of law.

He appeared to have completely forgotten the ideals of democratic ideals so cherished by all Sri Lanka. Gotabaya was ousted not just by the people - divine intervention came into play when he without rhyme or reason gave his name to the cremation of Muslims who perished due to Covid 19," the statement added.

"Instead of listening to real experts he decided that he was the expert in various critical issues where he was clearly out of his depth. Challenges like the fertiliser ban, he failed in every aspect of governance. Gotabaya Rajapaksa was a dictator in every sense of the word. The Almighty stepped in to save the people of Sri Lanka from a calamitous situation. Thank God Almighty. Events have proven that scoundrels try and find a way-out using patriotism. That after all - along with sovereignty - is the last refuge of any scoundrel, it said.
