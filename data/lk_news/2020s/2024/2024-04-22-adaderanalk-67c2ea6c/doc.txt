‘Fox Hill’ crash: Organisers evade responsibility, blame shifted to spectators

The organisers of the ‘Fox Hill Super Cross 2024’ motorsport racing event claim that they had assured the safety of the spectators at the event and that yesterday’s tragic accident was caused by the carelessness of the spectators themselves.

Speaking during a press conference held today (22), regarding the horror crash which resulted the death of 07 individuals and left 23 others injured during a racing event, the organisers of the event said that safe areas which are elevated from the tracks had been established for the spectators.

In response to a question raised by a journalist regarding their guarantee to the spectators of the event, an organizer said: “Fox Hill has a huge area for normal spectators around the pine tree corner. We have a grand stand and also the normal ticket and high-priced ticket viewing area.”

“All those are in a very safe and elevated areas and the Paddock Hills is there. So, the general public are well-protected. They are on an elevated area from the tracks.  For spectator safety-wise we have done the best we could and it’s safe”, he added.

Meanwhile, it was reported that during the 18th car race, the spectators who were at the location of the accident had encroached near the racing track beyond the limit for the spectators, eagerly anticipating to see an overturned car shortly before the tragic accident in question.

However, the Sri Lanka Army has initiated a separate internal investigation regarding the incident, while Diyatalawa Police is also conducting further investigations.
