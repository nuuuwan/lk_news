Major UK retailer Tesco set to introduce two fashion brands owned by Hela across its stores

The brand licensing division of Hela Apparel Holdings PLC, Focus Brands, has announced a strategic partnership with Tesco to introduce its Peter Werth and Fenchurch fashion brands to the retailer’s stores across the UK.

The collaboration further enhances the Hela Group’s long-standing relationship with one of the UK’s largest retailers and will provide consumers with the opportunity to purchase two of its owned fashion brands in Tesco for the first time, with an initial rollout across 100 UK stores later this year.

Hela’s manufacturing division has been a strategic supplier to Tesco for over a decade and received the supermarket’s Empowerment Award in 2023 for its innovative supply chain solutions.
