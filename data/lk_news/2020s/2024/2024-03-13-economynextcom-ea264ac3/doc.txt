Russian, Indian visitors to Sri Lanka remain high in March

ECONOMYNEXT – Visitors to Sri Lanka exceeded 500,000 this week, the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) Chairman Priyantha Fernando said.

“As of now, we have exceeded 500,000 arrivals for the year and 70,000 in March,” Fernando told EconomyNext on Wednesday.

The top five sources were Russia, India, Germany, United Kingdom and China.

There were 9,783 Russian tourists and 9,735 Indian tourists as of March 10.

The high visitor numbers from Russia were seen as the Department of Immigration said it was cancelling extended visas of Russians and Ukrainians following a criticism of a party on racist lines where only ‘white’ people were allowed.

There have been criticism that Russians were running businesses, but it is not known to what extent they were helping boost an eco-system of services or promotions that were helping bring visitors. (Colombo/Mar13/2024)
