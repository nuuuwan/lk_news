Sri Lanka’s copyright laws need to be updated for artificial intelligence: Lawyers

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Intellectual Property Act needs revisions to recognize creations by artificial intelligence, legal professionals point out.

“Our Intellectual Property Act established in 2003 recognizes only a human as an author,” lawyer and academic in intellectual property, Sidath Gajanayaka said at a panel discussion on ‘Integrating AI into Human Lives: Legal Challenges in the Age of AI’ on Thursday (8).

Section 5 of the Intellectual Property Act describes an author as ‘the physical person who has created the work’ paving the way for questions regarding the use of artificial intelligence in creative works.

Artificial intelligence programs, such as ChatGPT, have been able to write articles and research pieces independently.

“We must look at how much of a human intervention is there to write an article,” Gajanayaka said. “Who is recognized as the author is a dilemma. Ideally, it is a person who gave the prompt.”

Gajanayaka thinks that giving joint authorship to the person issuing the prompt and the machine may be a possibility.(Colombo/Feb9/20024)
