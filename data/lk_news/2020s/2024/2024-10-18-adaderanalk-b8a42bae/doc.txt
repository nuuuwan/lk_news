2024 General Election: Candidates advised to appoint financial managers

The People’s Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) points out that it is appropriate for the candidates contesting the upcoming General Election to appoint a separate individual to manage and maintain their financial records.

Its Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi, stated that if not candidates may encounter challenges similar to those experienced in the last presidential election when submitting accurate income and expenditure reports.

Meanwhile, the Executive Director of Institute for Democratic Reforms and Electoral Studies (IRES), Manjula Gajanayake further stressed the consequences for candidates who fail to provide proper expense reports.

“If in any way a candidate is unable to provide his expense reports, or if false information is entered, candidate may lose his political rights for 3 years through a judicial process,” he added.

Gajanayake further said that it could also lead to disqualification of the candidate’s position through a petition.
