Selling pressure in share market following court ruling on presidential poll

The stock market kicked off on a positive note yesterday but later witnessed significant selling pressure due to the petition filed in the Supreme Court seeking to prevent the calling of a presidential poll being dismissed by the apex court.

The court determination negatively affected the marketâ€™s trading activities and compelled the market to go further down, especially in both indices. The All Share Price Index went down by 105.5 points while S and P SL20 declined by 24.2 points. Turnover stood at Rs 657 million with two crossings. The crossings were reported in Hemas Holdings, which crossed 1.5 million shares to the tune of Rs 122.3 million and its shares traded at Rs 81.50 and Sampath Bank 600,000 shares crossed for Rs 46.8 million; its shares traded at Rs 78.

In the retail market top seven companies that mainly contributed to the turnover were; Sampath Bank Rs 66.7 million (856,000 shares traded), VallibelOne Rs 42 million (833,000 shares traded), LOLC Finance Rs 24.9 million (4.3 million shares traded), Dipped Products Rs 19.8 million (555,000 shares traded), Hayleys Rs 19 million (191,000 shares traded), Commercial Bank Rs 16.5 million (160,000 shares traded) and Access Engineering Rs 15.9 million (685,000 shares traded). During the day 32.7 million share volumes changed hands in 8352 transactions.

Yesterday the rupee opened relatively flat at Rs 304.50/65 to the US dollar, while bond yields were broadly steady and stocks opened 0.15 percent up, dealers said.

The rupee closed at Rs 304.45/75 to the greenback on Friday. In the secondary market, yields were steady, dealers said. A bond maturing on 15.12.2026 was quoted stable at 10.75/85 percent.
