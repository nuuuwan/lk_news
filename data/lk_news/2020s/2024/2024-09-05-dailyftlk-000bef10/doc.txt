Brave crew of MT Global Beauty rescues Sri Lankan fishermen in daring operation

The courageous crew of the vessel MT Global Beauty performed an astounding rescue operation off the coast of Sri Lanka on 24 August, saving the lives of two fishermen discovered adrift in the open sea.

In addition to saving the fishermen’s lives, this audacious rescue served as a shining example and a reminder of the crew’s unwavering dedication to maritime safety and the spirit of solidarity among sailors.

The MT Global Beauty Master Capt. Gurpinder Singh and his dedicated crew have received praise for their swift response and exemplary bravery.

The MT Global Beauty, owned and operated by Glory International FZ-LLC, UAE and managed by an Indian investor Capt. Jugwinder Singh Brar (Juggi Brar), responded promptly to the distress call last Saturday at around 3 p.m. Sri Lanka time, ensuring the immediate safety of the two local fishermen.

The owners of the vessel recognised the extraordinary feat, saying: “The actions of Capt. Gurpinder Singh and his crew are a shining example of the highest traditions of seafaring, where the safety and well-being of those in distress are given utmost priority.”

“This act of kindness highlights the importance of cooperation and empathy on the high seas,” Glory International FZ-LLC Managing Director Capt. Jugwinder Singh Brar said after the rescue mission, emphasising the crew’s dedication to assisting those in need regardless of nationality, ethnicity, religious affiliation, or circumstance.

The MT Global Beauty has a longstanding relationship with Sri Lanka, first arriving in Colombo in July 2023. The vessel’s mother company has been a key supplier of Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO) and High Sulphur Fuel Oil (HSFO) to Sri Lanka for over five years.

During Sri Lanka’s recent financial crisis, the company helped by supplying vital fuel to the ports of Trincomalee and Colombo during the country’s acute fuel shortage. Displaying remarkable understanding and generosity, the organisation provided these supplies on an open credit basis – meaning they did not require any payment in advance.

“Amid the financial crisis, we stood by your nation when others turned away,” Capt. Brar said, highlighting their continued support of Sri Lanka during challenging times.

“The rescue operation on 24 August is a further testament to the unwavering commitment of the MT Global Beauty and its crew to supporting and protecting those in need, regardless of the circumstances. This extraordinary act of bravery and compassion underscores the importance of maritime cooperation and the shared values that unite seafarers around the globe,” Capt. Brar added.

“Despite being kind, helpful, and cooperative, it is regrettable to realise that the local authorities of the country are unduly delaying our operations,” Capt. Brar further added.
