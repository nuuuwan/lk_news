Weerasena Gamage sworn in as Member of Parliament

Weerasena Gamage of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) was sworn in as a Member of Parliament on Wednesday (24).

He took oaths before Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena soon after the parliamentary proceedings kicked off.

Earlier this month, the Election Commission had named Weerasena to fill the parliamentary seat that fell vacant following the demise of SLPP’s Anuradhapura District MP H. Nandasena.

Nandasena passed away at the age of 69 on 05 April due to a sudden illness.

Accordingly, Weerasena was next in line on the SLPP list for the Anuradhapura District after securing a total of 38,242 votes upon contesting the 2020 Parliamentary Elections. He managed to place 9th in the preferential votes list.

Following Nandasena’s demise, the Acting Secretary General of Parliament informed the Election Commission, in writing, that a seat in the Ninth Parliament had become vacant. This notification was made in terms of Section 64(1) of the Parliamentary Elections Act, No. 1 of 1981.
