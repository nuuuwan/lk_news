’SJB will have to decide whether it wants me or not’:Hirunika

Colombo, June 2 (Daily Mirror) Former MP Hirunika Premachandra said today that the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) will have to decide whether it wants her or not if it gets into a deal to grant a pardon to Duminda Silva.

"I trust that SJB leader Sajith Premadasa will not agree to grant a Presidential pardon to Duminda Silva. However, others around him may convince him to get into a deal with the relevant people. The party will have to decide if it wants me or others in such an eventuality," Ms. Premachandra told the media.

"I was able to reverse the pardon granted to Duminda Silva by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa as he had granted it without following the procedure," she recalled.
