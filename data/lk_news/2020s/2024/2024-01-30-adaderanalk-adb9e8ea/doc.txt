Former MP Mujibur Rahman hospitalised during SJB protest

Former Parliamentarian Mujibur Rahman was reportedly rushed to the Colombo National Hospital after falling ill during the protest march staged by the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) this afternoon (30 Jan.).

In a post on X (formerly Twitter), MP de Silva stated that Rahman had suffered “breathing difficulties caused by strong tear gas attack”.
