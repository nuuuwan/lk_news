The Fort Magistrateâ€™s Court has issued detention orders on the 11 suspects apprehended by the Sri Lanka Navy in two trawlers while in the possession of 65 kilograms of heroin off the Southern coast.

Accordingly, the court granted permission for the suspects to be detained for 07 days by the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) for further interrogation.

The Sri Lanka Navy seized a local multi-day fishing trawler carrying over 65kg of heroin, and another multi-day fishing trawler suspected of assisting it, during a special operation carried out about 100 nautical miles off the Dondra Head, in southern waters on Saturday (20). The operation also led to the apprehension of 11 suspects in connection to the smuggling racket.

The special operation was mounted by the Sri Lanka Navy and Police Narcotics Bureau, together with intelligence services, which led to the recovery of 03 sacks stuffed with heroin weighing more than 65kg and 076g, intending to be smuggled into the country within the apprehended trawler.

Meanwhile, the street value of the seized heroin is believed to be more than Rs. 1,626 million.

The apprehended suspects, who are from 28 to 52 years of age, have been identified as residents of Matara, Gandara and Dondra areas.
