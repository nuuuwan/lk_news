President Ranil Wickremesinghe has announced the acceleration of the national ‘Urumaya’ freehold deeds program, with a directive to complete it by June, ensuring legal ownership of land for all citizens.

He underscored his vision for the Northern Province’s economic transformation highlighting a concerted effort to address post-war challenges comprehensively, to establish the region as a vibrant economic hub in collaboration with local communities, State agencies and international partners.

The President asserted land ownership as a fundamental right for every citizen, irrespective of their background, during his address at the ‘Urumaya’ Freehold Deeds program held in Ottagapulam, Jaffna yesterday.

Highlighting the program’s progress, 408 land deeds were distributed to the people of Jaffna, a symbolic step toward achieving the initiative’s broader goal of granting free land rights to two million individuals countrywide.

Following the end of conflict, a significant portion of land was requisitioned by the military. To date, the Government has released around 63,000 acres of both State-owned and privately-owned land. Furthermore, around 2,600 acres of land previously held by the navy have been returned to the use of civilians. Similarly, 2,600 acres of land, encompassing both Government and private holdings, formerly under the control of the Air Force, have been returned.

The event also witnessed the release of lands formerly utilised by the Jaffna Security Force Headquarters, with 234 acres allocated for agricultural purposes in Valikamam North.

Wickremesinghe emphasised the historical context of land ownership, tracing back to the monarchy era and addressing the colonial-era policies that led to Government ownership of vast land parcels.

He reiterated the Government’s commitment to restoring land rights to individuals, ensuring equitable access to this fundamental resource.

In addition to land distribution, the President inaugurated an agriculture modernisation program in Kopai, Jaffna, aimed at enhancing income opportunities through agricultural development.

“A new program similar to initiatives in other parts of the North is being launched in Jaffna. We are addressing post-war challenges and have initiated the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). However, our efforts are not confined to this. We are committed to providing comprehensive solutions to the issues affecting the people and enhancing their sources of income. Consequently, we are spearheading the establishment of a new economy in this province,” he added.

The initiative reflects broader efforts to revitalise the economy in the post-conflict Northern Province, leveraging renewable energy resources, promoting tourism, and establishing investment zones.

“We have devised plans to bolster agriculture from Vavuniya to Jaffna and harness the extensive solar and wind energy resources in the province. We aim to collaborate with India in this endeavour. Furthermore, we seek to stimulate growth in the tourism and fishing industries. Additionally, land has been designated for investment zones. Over the next 5 to 10 years, we are committed to implementing these initiatives to foster a robust economy in the Northern region. I extend an invitation to everyone to collectively contribute to the transformation of Northern Sri Lanka into a significant economic hub,” he said.

The event witnessed the participation of religious leaders, Government officials, and dignitaries, including Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda, State Ministers Suren Raghavan and Kader Masthan, and Members of Parliament Angajan Ramanathan and Dharmalingam Siddarthan, among others.
