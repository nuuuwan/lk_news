Sri Lanka delegation in China discuss investment opportunities, export of water

ECONOMYNEXT – A Sri Lankan delegation in China has met with Chinese businessmen to discuss ‘environmentally friendly investment programs’ in Sri Lanka.

Minister of State for Sports and Youth Affairs Rohana Dissanayake visited China recently for a Sri Lanka-China trade investment program, the Department of Government Information said in a statement.

Possibilities discussed were “the importation of electric cars, electric motorcycles and three-wheelers, light lorries based on the business environment for the purpose of government employees, or investments in starting factories for production in Sri Lanka,” the statement read.

The introduction of modern machinery and farming equipment was also discussed, as cutting down production cost and increasing harvests was a problem for Sri Lankan farmers.

Chinese businessmen expressed interest in investing in the installation of solar panels and wind power, and the export of bottled drinking water, king coconut, spices, tea and coffee, according to the statement.

Dissanayake is said to have met the Chinese and Russian Chamber of Commerce representatives during the visit: “The Chairman of the Chinese and Russian Chamber of Commerce said that he is ready to provide all necessary support for the trilateral market and invited the minister to participate in the trade fair held in Russia next month.” (Colombo/Jan29/2024)
