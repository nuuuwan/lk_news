Bus driver dies after falling ill at the wheel, causing crash

A 39-year-old bus driver attached to the Nawalapitiya SLTB Bus Depot has reportedly passed away due to a sudden illness while driving a bus towards Nawalapitiya, thereby causing the bus to veer off the road and crash.

A bus which was operating on the route from Nuwara Eliya to Nawa-lapitiya via Dimbula Pathana had reportedly encountered a technical fault during its journey last evening (15).

As a result of this, the passengers of the bus had been transferred to another SLTB bus. However, while the bus which had broken down was being driven back to Nawalapitiya after being repaired, the driver had suddenly fallen ill causing the vehicle to veer off the road.

The conductor of the bus had immediately contacted the Lindula Police regarding the incident and police officers had arrived at the scene and rushed the driver to the Lindula Hospital.

However, he had been pronounced dead on admission to the hospital.
