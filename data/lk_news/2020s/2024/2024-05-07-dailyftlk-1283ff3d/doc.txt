Opines this as a first step towards gradual improvement in airport and immigration operations as sophisticated systems are costly

Public Security Minister Tiran Alles on Monday announced that a delegation comprising five representatives from Singapore’s Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) is scheduled to visit Sri Lanka on 27 May to conduct a comprehensive study of the operations at Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) and its immigration system.

Speaking to journalists he revealed that he had made a request to the Government of Singapore six months ago, aiming to boost Sri Lanka’s airport and immigration operational efficiency.

“The visiting team is expected to spend a week in the country, examining the existing systems and procedures,” he said.

Acknowledging Singapore’s reputation for operating one of the world’s most efficient and passenger-friendly airports, Minister Alles said the potential benefits of adopting best practices and insights from Singapore’s model.

“Although we may not be able to implement such sophisticated systems overnight as it costs millions of dollars, it can be a first step to gradually improve our airport and immigration operations,” he explained.

The Minister also noted the Government’s openness to adjusting the VFS Global system, if necessary, to address any operational challenges or streamline processes.
