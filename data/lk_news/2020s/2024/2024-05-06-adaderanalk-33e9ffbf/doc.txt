Sri Lanka to retain existing visa fee; Immigration Dept. to handle issuing visas

It was decided at the Cabinet meeting held today (06) to maintain the existing US $50 fee for a 30-day visa for foreigners visiting Sri Lanka, the President’s Media Division reported.

Furthermore, it was confirmed that the free visa service currently offered to citizens of seven countries, namely India, China, Russia, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, will continue while the Government also emphasizes that the Department of Immigration and Emigration assumes full responsibility for issuing relevant visas upon entry into the country for foreigners.

Amidst the notable progress in the country’s tourism sector, numerous stakeholders within the industry have recently urged President Ranil Wickremesinghe to maintain the maximum visa fee for foreigners at US $50, the statement said.

They have also highlighted that this decision stands as significant support for the future growth of the tourism industry.

Consequently, President Ranil Wickremesinghe reached this decision after presenting the matter during today’s Cabinet meeting, the PMD said.
