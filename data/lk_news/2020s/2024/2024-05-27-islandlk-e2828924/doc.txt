SL’s debt restructuring issues disrupt Kandy city’s JICA-funded sanitation project

Despite almost three years passing, a billion rupee sanitation project intended to be implemented within Kandy city limits is yet to reach completion as the Japan International Cooperating Agency (JICA)—the executing bilateral aid agency—is yet to release the final Rs. 1 billion required to complete the project’s final stage due to matters connected to Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring process.

“The reason JICA has given for not releasing the final Rs. 1 billion to complete the last leg of the project is Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring. With the Rs. 21 billion we received in three packages to complete the three stages of surveying, planning and building infrastructure to establish the wastewater management system, at least 4,000 households, commercial properties (state and private) and institutions (state and private) are utilizing the facilities. The balance monies, upon receipt, will enable the connecting of the remaining 6,000 wastewater connections, a senior engineer said.

Kandy Municipal Engineer D. M. D. S. Seneviratne told The Island Financial Review that although Rs. 22 billion has been spent on the project, the work has stopped midway. ‘While Rs. 21 billion has been utilized for the sanitation project, it has not been implemented at the final level, he said.

When contacted JICA representative Takashi Kondo told The Island Financial Review that all JICA-funded projects, and not only the Kandy project, were stopped following Sri Lanka’s defaulting on its public debt and the negative image consequently created.

However, Kondo expressed confidence that they are ready to undertake all the technical responsibilities.

The Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ) Executive Director Dilena Pathragoda told The Island Financial Review that as a civic-minded organization, they would do their best for the betterment of the people of Kandy. ‘We would request officials of the Japanese embassy and JICA to consider providing Rs. 1 billion, he added.

‘Building the necessary infrastructure facilities to collect wastewater generated from kitchens, bathrooms and toilets across 733 hectares and providing connections to 12,200 private residences, state institutions, and commercial property units in a densely congested city with complex topography is no easy task, he explained.

Speaking to journalists about the challenges faced by the Municipal Council, Kandy MMC’s Chief Health and Medical Officer Dr. Pasan Jayasinghe said, “Kandy city municipal limits cater to the water and sanitation needs of tax-paying residents and business owners, who number approximately 125,000. In addition, we have 375, 000 daily visitors who access the city for tourism, administrative needs, schooling, work and medical requirements, to name a few.

‘The facility built with international agency funds provides us with the capacity to accommodate the sanitation needs of up to 300,000 people. We currently exceed capacity, especially during torrential rains or when there is overcrowding in the city; for instance, during holidays, he said.

Jayasinghe reiterated that even if communities or businesses complained about pollution caused by improper wastewater disposal, given the limited staff, which included five Public Health Inspectors (PHIs) and himself, there were mounting challenges in attending to all complaints.

‘Ideally, one PHI should provide their services to 10,000 persons in the field. However, although I am the Chief Health and Medical Officer, I have to take over some of the field visits. Each of us has to oversee double the capacity of people. We then have to ensure that visitors to the city are provided with hygienic sanitation facilities and that eateries are selling hygienically prepared food. We have serious capacity issues when executing field duties in a city that serves the sanitation needs of 500,000 people, Jayasinghe added.
