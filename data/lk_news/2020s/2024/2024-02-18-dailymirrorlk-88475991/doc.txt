Health trade unions want Dr. Bellana removed

Colombo, Feb 17 (Daily Mirror) -  The collective of trade unions representing the health sector have urged the Health Ministry to remove Dr. Rukshan Bellana as the Deputy Director of the National Hospital, Colombo.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, president of the Federation of Health Professionals, Ravi Kumudesh said Dr. Bellana had vehemently criticized the junior staffers for their involvement in the recent strike organized by health trade unions, humiliating the health workers.

“He (Dr. Bellana) is not appropriate to hold the position as he has put down the health workers and disgraced their rules, raising tensions to boiling point,” he said.

“Hence, we will continue to push the authorities in the form of continuous protests, until the removal of Dr. Bellana” he added.

The situation escalated on Friday (Feb. 16) when Dr. Bellana was forcibly confined to his office by the protesting junior staff at the National Hospital in Colombo
