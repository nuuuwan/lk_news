Mathews has not retired to be ‘invited’ T20 squad - Wanindu

Sri Lanka’s T20 captain Wanindu Hasaranga stresses that he is not prepared to respond to questions regarding any rumours circulating on social media.

Joining a press conference held in Colombo last evening (Jan. 15), Hasaranga emphasized that his first target as a captain and as a team is to triumph at the upcoming T20 World Cup which is just five months away.

“We still have a small number like 08 matches before the T20 World Cup”, he added.

Meanwhile, in response to a question raised by a journalist regarding whether he invited former captain Angelo Mathews to join the T20 squad, Hasaranga emphasized that Mathews is not a retired player and that therefore, there is no need to invite him to the team as he is already in it.

“Angelo Mathews is not a retired player. We could see the performance of a well-experienced player like Mathews…the way he batted until the end of a match so easily. He has not retired to be invited [into the team]”, he claimed.
