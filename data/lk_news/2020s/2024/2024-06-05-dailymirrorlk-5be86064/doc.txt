Step-motherly treatment for Sri Lankan team in US: Sajith tells Parliament

Parliament, June 5 (Daily Mirror)- The Sri Lankan cricket team touring the USA for the World Cup T20 series has faced step-motherly treatment by the International Cricket Council (ICC), Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said today.

He told Parliament that the Sri Lankan team has had to face serious issues with regard to logistics and scheduling of the matches.

He said according to ICC regulations, the team must be located in a hotel within a maximum of 45 minutes distance from the stadium where the match is to be played and that the Sri Lankan team had been located in a hotel with a distance of one and a half hours.

The Opposition Leader said the team has missed practice matches due to these issues and said that only the Sri Lankan team has faced these issues.

"Why this step-motherly treatment only for our team? We cannot expect victory unless they are provide with the necessary facilities. This will affect their outcome," he said.

Premadasa urged the Sports Minister to look into the matter.

Leader of the House Susil Premajayantha said the matter would be directed to the Ministry of Sports and that an answer will be provided tomorrow.
