Dr. Fernandopulle presents two private member bills to push for more women representation in Parliament

Two private member bills have been presented to parliament with the aim of increasing women’s representation in the legislative body.

The two bills, reportedly submitted by parliamentarian Dr Sudarshini Fernandopulle as private member proposals, aim to address the issue of female representation in parliament. One bill seeks to amend the Parliamentary Elections Act, advocating for a minimum of 30% female representation in every recognized political party.

Additionally, another proposal submitted to Parliament as a draft bill aims to amend the Constitution as the 22nd Amendment. This proposal suggests that not less than 50% of women members be included in the national list nominated to represent the Parliament of a political party or an independent group.

Fernandopulle told journalists that despite her requests to political parties to take steps to enhance women’s representation, she opted to introduce the necessary legislation herself due to the absence of a positive response.
