Shortcomings observed in Online Safety Act; open for amendments: Wijeyadasa

Parliament, Feb. 08 (Daily Mirror)- The government has observed that there are some shortcomings in the recently enacted Online Safety Act and the government is open to bring in amendments to the Act, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said today.

Responding to questions by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa and SJB MP Harsha de Silva, Minister Rajapakshe told Parliament that it was pointless calling the Act as erronous and requested the Opposition to propose amendments to the Act.

"There are shortcomings in this Act. We also have observed some shortcomings. We are open to make amednments. You propose the required amendments. We will discuss them. Power is vested with Parliament. We should discuss it in Parliament and make necessary amendments without calling the Act erronous and it should be set on fire," the Minister said.

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said that it was praiseworthy that the government has admitted that the Online Safety Act is errounous and called for a party leaders' meeting to rectify the shortcomings.

Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardane said he had no objections to discussions over the Act.
