COYLE pioneers Green Entrepreneurship and mangrove restoration in Sri Lanka

The Chamber of Young Lankan Entrepreneurs (COYLE) hosted “The Big Lunch,” along with iLEAD International Academy and Centre for International Forestry Research and World Agroforestry (CIFOR-ICRAF); a groundbreaking event aimed at bringing together stakeholders for the promotion of green entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka. This gathering marked a significant step towards positioning Sri Lanka as a leader in environmental conservation and sustainable economic growth. The event was attended by the members of the Business Chambers, government officials from the Ministry of Environment, representatives of various UN agencies, International and National NGOs/ Civil Society Organizations, Academic and Research Institutions, independent Environmentalists and youth.

The focus of ‘The Big Lunch’ was to generate action ideas to protect and enhance Sri Lanka’s position by fostering a stronger approach to nature conservation, after being selected as one of the seven UN Flagship programs for mangrove restoration. The initiative on Green Entrepreneurship for Mangroves employs a tripartite approach, uniting local communities, businesses, and research institutions to coordinate mangrove restoration efforts effectively.

Ruwan Wijewardene, Senior Advisor to the President on Climate Change, speaking on the occasion as the Chief Guest, highlighted the need to create an environment conducive to open and constructive dialogue among all stakeholders. He expressed his confidence to say that this program would show to the world that economic growth and environmental conservation can coexist harmoniously. By supporting the development of entrepreneurial ventures that prioritizes environmental sustainability, COYLE is paving the way for a greener future.

COYLE members will play a crucial role in this initiative through the establishment of a new Entrepreneur Development Centre, which will provide support and resources to budding entrepreneurs dedicated to green business practices. Ravi Pratap Singh, a key advocate for green entrepreneurship and mangrove restoration in Sri Lanka, introduced the project at the event. He underscored the importance of collaborative efforts between the businesses, research institutions and institutions working for youth mobilization at the community level. While summarizing the action ideas that emerged from the Big Lunch, Dr. Rupesh Bhomia, Senior Scientist of CIFOR-ICRAF assured their continuing support to this project through the global technical expertise of ICRAF on the subject.

Chairman of COYLE, Mr. Thushira Raddella, encapsulated the spirit of the event with his remarks: “We aim to support those who are ready to develop entrepreneurial ventures via supporting the environment, especially conserving the mangroves. Through this, we can show the world that economic growth and environmental conservation can both go hand in hand. At COYLE, we believe that not only should we grow our existing entrepreneurs, but also we must promote new avenues of entrepreneurship and innovations.”

Restoring and protecting mangroves is crucial, as reflected in the UN Sustainable Development Goal SDG-14, which focuses on sustainably managing our oceans and coasts and recognizes mangroves’ immense value to local communities. Mr. Raddella added, “The importance of restoring and protecting mangroves is reflected most clearly in SDG 14.
