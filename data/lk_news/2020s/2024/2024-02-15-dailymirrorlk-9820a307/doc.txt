Better to abolish executive presidency; I have already enjoyed it: Mahinda

Colombo, Feb 15 (Daily Mirror) - Former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa expressed the opinion that it will be preferable to abolish the Executive Presidency and said that he had enjoyed having held the position.

Answering a question raised by a journalist about the political situation in the country, he said the country's political situation is good and that it is better to abolish the Executive Presidency.

"It should be abolished because the whole country is requesting to abolish it.

"Attempting to postpone the Presidential election might be a trap for the opposition. We know President Ranil Wickremesinghe well," he said.

"Whatever the election, our candidate will be victorious. Our candidate will come to the stage at the correct time. Wait for that," he said.

While commenting on the official visit of National People's Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake to India, he said that he is glad that the NPP has finally realized the importance of forging bilateral relations with countries like India.
