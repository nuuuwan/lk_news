Final decision on 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Exam expected today

The final decision regarding this yearâ€™s Grade 05 Scholarship Examination, of which several questions were allegedly leaked, is scheduled to be announced today (14).

Accordingly, the Commissioner General of Examinations will hold a special press conference this morning to make an announcement on the matter.

However, reports suggest that the scholarship examination will not be re-conducted.

It is stated that this decision was made following investigations, which revealed that only three questions had been leaked.

Meanwhile, the evaluation of answer sheets, which had been temporarily suspended, is expected to commence immediately.

Several committees were appointed to investigate the scholarship examination, and their final conclusion was that only three questions had been leaked prior to the exam.

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) had also launched a separate investigation into the question paper leak.

However, a group of parents, holding press conferences and staging protests on several occasions, had claimed that the entire question paper had been leaked.

The parents raised the issue with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and as a result, the evaluation of the answer sheets for the scholarship examination was suspended until the investigation was completed.
