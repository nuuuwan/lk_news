Adverse weather reduces water pressure in several areas in Colombo

Colombo, June 3 (Daily Mirror) - Due to adverse weather conditions, the water pressure will decrease during peak hours due to the disconnection of the main water supply line near the Thummodara bridge, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) said.

They said the main water line from the Kalatuwawa water purification plant has been disconnected and the pressure of the water supply will be low between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and 9 p.m.

Accordingly, the Galagedara, Padukka, Godagama, Homagama, Pannipitiya, Rukmalgama, Pelenwatta, Mattegoda, Maharagama, Borelesgamuwa and Pepiliyana areas will be affected by the low-pressure water supply.
