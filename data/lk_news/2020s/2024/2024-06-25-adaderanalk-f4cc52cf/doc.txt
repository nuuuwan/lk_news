NPP will back bill to decriminalize same-sex relationships - Harini Amarasuriya

National People’s Power (NPP) Parliamentarian Dr. Harini Amarasuriya states that their party will support the private member’s bill tabled by SLPP MP Premnath C. Dolawaththa to decriminalize same-sex relationships under the penal code.

Joining the ‘Derana 360’ programme, Dr. Amarasuriya explained their party’s stance regarding the LGBTQ+ community.

“We have been advocating for this community for a while. They are also a part of this society. Gender identities are diverse, including those of the same-sex community. From the beginning, we are of the stance that individuals should not be discriminated based on their gender”, she said.

“Specifically, these same-sex relationships have been criminalized in our penal code. This is not a law which was originated in our country; it was introduced during the Victorian era by the British. Therefore, we believe it should be amended,” Dr. Amarasuriya expressed.

“MP Premnath C. Dolawaththa, a government representative, has tabled a private member’s bill in the Parliament to amend the penal code…”

Commenting further, Dr. Harini Amarasuriya said: “Our party believes that decisions regarding the relationships of two adults should be made by the individuals involved, not dictated by law. However, a law should remain in place to protect children and minimize potential harm.”

“…Only the sexual relationships with animals are a crime…So, the NPP will back this during its third reading,” she assured.
