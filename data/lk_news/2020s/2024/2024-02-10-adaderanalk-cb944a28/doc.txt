Organized by the India Foundation in collaboration with India’s Ministry of External Affairs and the Australian Government, along with support from the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Singapore, and Perth-US Asia Centre, the conference seeks to chart a roadmap for the region’s future.

Sri Lanka previously hosted the second edition of the IOC in 2017, under the patronage of Wickremesinghe, who was the then-Prime Minister.

Wickremesinghe’s attendance underscores Sri Lanka’s commitment to regional diplomacy and its active engagement in addressing common challenges for the collective benefit of Indian Ocean nations.
