15 Sri Lankan fishermen detained in Myanmar prisons repatriated

Fifteen Sri Lankan fishermen, who were detained in Myanmar prisons, have been released and repatriated to Sri Lanka. They arrived at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake this morning (11), Ada Derana reporter said.

The fishermen in question had been arrested by Myanmar Coast Guard personnel, while adrift at seas off Myanmar allegedly due to technical issues with their fishing vessels.

Upon arrival at the BIA, all 15 individuals were arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department’s (CID) Human Trafficking, Smuggling, and Maritime Crimes Division for allegedly not departing from a recognized airport or port to a foreign country.

However, they have been granted bail after being produced before Negombo Magistrate’s Court today.

The repatriated fishermen, aged between 18 and 50, hail from Katuneriya, Marawila, Uswetakeiyawa, and Kurunegala areas, according to Ada Derana reporter.
