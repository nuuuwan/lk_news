Cabinet nod to gazette and table revised  Online Safety Bill for Parliament approval

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved publishing the draft Bill on amended Online Safety Act No. 9 of 2024 in the Government gazette notification and present the same in Parliament for approval.

“The draft Bill prepared by the Legal Draftsman received clearance from the Attorney General,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

He said the move aims to address the concerns raised by experts and ensure that the legislation effectively secures online methods while considering expert input.

Following the Supreme Court’s decision on the draft Bill concerning the security of online methods and its subsequent passage in Parliament, the Online Safety Act No. 9 of 2024 is now in operation.

Despite the Bill’s enactment, experts in the field raised concerns and proposed amendments to certain sections of the Bill. However, these amendments could not be incorporated during the committee stage of the legislative process.

To address these concerns, the Cabinet on 12 February 2024, approved preparing a draft Bill to amend the Online Safety Act No. 9 of 2024, incorporating the suggested amendments.
