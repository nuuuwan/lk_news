The suspect, who has been identified as a 34-year-old resident of Katupotha, was arrested by the Organized Crime Prevention Unit of the Police STF.

At the time of his arrest, the suspect was in possession of 8 grams of ‘Ice’ drugs, 5 pieces of army uniform clothing and 6 rounds of 9mm ammunition, police said.
