Taxi driver sentenced to 10 years RI for raping underage girl

A taxi driver was sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court for raping an underage girl nearly a decade ago.

The 35-year-old man had been accused of sexually assaulting the girl who was living in a rented house near his residence and was preparing to sit for the G.C.E. Ordinary Level (O/L) examination.

Delivering the verdict today, High Court Judge Aditya Patabendige also ordered the convict to pay a fine of Rs. 10,000 and ordered him to pay Rs. 50,000 in compensation to the victim.

The High Court Judge further ruled that if the compensation is not paid, it will be recovered as an additional fine and if the convict fails to pay that fine too, he will be sentenced to an additional two years of rigorous imprisonment.
