The Ceylon Chamber’s SLIBC leads Business Promotion Mission to Indonesia

The Sri Lanka-Indonesia Business Council (SLIBC) of The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce successfully conducted a Business Promotion Mission to Indonesia from 6 October to 11 October 2024.

The missions’ primary aim was to strengthen trade, investment, and business ties between Sri Lanka and Indonesia, while exploring opportunities for collaboration in key industries. The delegation comprised 14 Sri Lankan business professionals representing diverse sectors, including food & beverage, logistics, pharmaceuticals, apparel, travel, IT, and recreation industries. The mission was led by SLIBC President Vish Govindasamy and Vice President D. S. Wickramasingha.

The delegation participated in various business fora, expos, and meetings with key stakeholders in Indonesia’s trade and business sectors. A focal point of the visit was the Indonesia-South and Central Asia (INASCA) Business Forum 2024, organised by Indonesia’s Foreign Affairs Ministry, under the theme “Unlocking Potentials and Fostering Economic Partnership”. The forum provided a platform to discuss emerging trade opportunities and partnerships between Indonesia and the South and Central Asian region, with a special focus on food security, health, and technology. The SLIBC in collaboration with the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Jakarta, operated a booth at the INASCA Business Forum, which attracted significant interest from the business community.

SLIBC President Vish Govindasamy, participated in a high-level panel discussion on “Food Security and Health”, alongside notable speakers including Eurasian Group Companies CEO Mukashev Baltabek, Indonesian Palm Oil Association Chairman Eddy Martono, and PT Bio Farma Director – Business Development Yuliana Indriati. This panel emphasised the importance of regional cooperation in ensuring sustainable food security and addressing health challenges.

A business networking session hosted by the Association of Sri Lankans Living in Indonesia (ASLI), in collaboration with the Sri Lankan Embassy in Jakarta, provided an excellent opportunity for delegates to engage with Sri Lankan entrepreneurs based in Indonesia.

The delegation also attended the 39th Trade Expo Indonesia, organised by the Indonesia Trade Ministry. The Trade Expo is one of Indonesia’s largest and most important platforms showcasing the country’s industrial capabilities, emerging business opportunities, and its role as a regional economic hub. The Expo provided Sri Lankan delegates with a firsthand look at the breadth of Indonesia’s market potential and the opportunities for collaboration across multiple sectors.

The delegation also visited MM2100 Industrial Town in Cikarang, Indonesia, where they gained valuable insights into Indonesia’s industrial developments. The delegates participated in an interactive session with industry leaders, which provided practical knowledge about real-time industrial operations in the region. The delegation also met with the Chairperson and board members of the Indonesia Employers’ Association (APINDO), engaging in productive discussions aimed at enhancing trade and business relations between the two countries.

The mission was coordinated and facilitated by the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Jakarta, with additional support from the Indonesian Foreign Affairs Ministry and the Indonesian Embassy in Sri Lanka. SriLankan Airlines served as the official airline partner for the mission, providing logistical support.
