Cabinet approves upgrade of radiation therapy equipment across hospitals

The Cabinet of Ministers on Tuesday approved upgrading linear accelerators at Kandy National Hospital, Karapitiya National Hospital and Batticaloa Teaching Hospital and to supply advanced radiation therapy equipment to hospitals in Rathnapura, Badulla, Hambanthota, Anuradhapura and Kurunegala.

This initiative is part of the medium-term budget framework for 2024-2026.

The upgrade will significantly enhance the cancer treatment capabilities at these hospitals, ensuring that patients receive the most advanced care available.

An agreement was made in 2013 between the Electa Company in the UK and the Health Ministry to supply 14 linear accelerators for cancer care services in two phases.

The first phase was implemented, and the second phase is now set to proceed.

Due to the exclusion of several standardised components for modern cancer treatments in the original agreement, Sri Lankan oncologists recommended procuring advanced machines.

Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathiranaâ€™s proposal to this effect was approved by the Cabinet.
