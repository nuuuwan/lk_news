New parking system to be implemented within Colombo city limits

The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) says that steps have been taken to introduce a new parking management system within the city limits of Colombo.

Accordingly, the CMC Deputy Director (Traffic and Road Design) Eng. Manjula Kularathna, stated that it is planned to employ one contractor for one designated zone.

He said that instead of the current system, where a contractor and an administrator are assigned to each road, the new parking management system will focus on assigning one contractor for each designated zone.

Furthermore, this new system is expected to be implemented within three months and it aims to improve convenience for drivers who use parking spaces within a specific zone.

Kularathna further stated that under the current system, a parking ticket cannot be reused within the same zone for short-term parking whereas the new system is expected to enhance the convenience of the drivers by allowing them to park the vehicles in two or three places within an hour in the respective zone using the same parking ticket.

He also stated that advanced technologies are expected to be used in the future to enhance vehicle parking services.
