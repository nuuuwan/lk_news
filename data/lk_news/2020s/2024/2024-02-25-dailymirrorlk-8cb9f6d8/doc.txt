T.M. Dilshan gains Australian citizenship

Australia, Feb 25 (Daily Mirror) - Former Sri Lankan cricketer Tillakaratne Dilshan has obtained Australian citizenship following a citizenship ceremony, Australian MP Jason Wood said.

"Dilshan is regarded as the best Sri Lankan player in run-chases in ODI history. He also holds the record for being the top run scorer in the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup with 500 runs and scored a century against England in the semi-final. Additionally, he was part of the Sri Lankan team that won the 2014 ICC World Twenty20," the MP posted on social media.

As a new Aussie and local resident, the MP said that he hopes Dilshan will join a local team and continue to share his talents with the community.

"It was great to hear that his daughter Resandi is following in her fatherâ€™s footsteps," he added.
