IGP Tennakoon appears before Supreme Court

Police Chief Deshabandu Tennakoon arrived at the Supreme Court complex this morning (05), complying with the summons issued to him yesterday.

The Inspector General of Police (IGP) was summoned by the country’s apex court to inquire into the particulars mentioned in the fundamental rights (FR) petitions filed by five Officers-in-Charge (OICs) with respect to the transfers they were given following the ‘Aragalaya’ movement.

The legal counsels representing the petitioners presented facts before a three-member judge bench presided over by Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya yesterday, after which the police chief was ordered to make an appearance before the courts today.
