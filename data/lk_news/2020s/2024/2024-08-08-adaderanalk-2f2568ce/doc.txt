Five including Vass Gunawardena and son sentenced to 4 years RI

Former DIG Vass Gunawardena, his son Ravindu Gunawardena and three other police officers, who were convicted of several charges including the abduction and unlawful detention of Nipuna Ramanayake, a student of an IT Institute in Malabe in 2009, have been sentenced to 04 years of rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court.

Meanwhile, three other defendants in the case including Vass Gunawardenaâ€™s wife Shyamali Priyadharshani Perera have been acquitted and released from the case.

The verdict in the case was delivered today (08) by Colombo High Court Judge Amal Ranaraja, following the conclusion of a lengthy trial.

Ramanayake, a 21-year-old student of the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT) at Malabe was allegedly abducted and brutally assaulted on August 09, 2009 by the son and wife of then SSP Vaas Gunawardena along with several other policemen.

It is alleged that the student was abducted at gunpoint and assaulted for several hours, over a personal feud, by Ravindu and a group of police officers.

The accused had been out on bail following their arrest, except the former DIG and his son Ravindu Gunawardena who have been sentenced to death over the murder of businessman Mohammed Siyam.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court, earlier today (08), confirmed the death sentences imposed on former DIG Vass Gunawardena, his son Ravindu, and four others, who were found guilty of abducting and murdering businessman Mohammed Siyam in 2013.

The Supreme Court delivered this verdict while dismissing the appeal petitions filed by Vass Gunawardena and the other defendants seeking their acquittal.

Accordingly, the verdict upholds the death sentences of the accused, which also include a Sub-Inspector (SI) and three Police Constables (PCs).
