Sri Lanka, India leaders discuss energy connectivity, fishermen’s issue

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s President Anura Dissanayake and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed energy connectivity including picking up pace on the Sampur project, during Dissanayake’s first foreign State visit since assuming office.

Modi and Dissanayake addressed a joint press conference in New Delhi and outlined their vision for strengthening bilateral ties.

“In our economic cooperation, we have laid emphasis on investment-led growth and connectivity,” Modi, who spoke in Hindi, was quoted as saying in Indian media.

“We have decided that physical, digital, and energy connectivity will be important pillars of our partnership.

“Work will be done for establishing electricity grid connectivity and a multi-product petroleum pipeline.

Bilateral trade will be boosted by signing the stalled ETCA agreement, he said.

Dissanayake thanked India for aid provided and reassured India of Sri Lanka’s commitment to safeguard Indian interests, “We will not allow our land to be used in any way that is detrimental to India.”

He also broached the contentious issue of Indian fishermen using bottom trawlers and encroaching on Sri Lankan waters.

“We want to find a durable and sustainable solution to the fishermen’s issue that has become a plague for both our countries. There are bottom trawling systems being adopted by the fishermen in that area and that needs to be put an end to because that will spell doom to this industry.” (Colombo/Dec16/2024)
