Shanto to lead Bangladesh’s squad for T20 World Cup

(ICC) - Najmul Hossain Shanto, who was appointed as Bangladesh captain in all formats earlier this year, is poised to lead his team in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024.

On the back of a solid 4-1 win over Zimbabwe in the recently-concluded T20I home series, Bangladesh announced their 15-member squad for next month's marquee event.

The squad also features experienced all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, who returned to T20I cricket after a gap of nearly a year. Shakib was named in the squad for Bangladesh's final two T20Is against Zimbabwe and impressed with a four-wicket haul in the fourth game.

There were no major surprises in Bangladesh’s 15-player squad for the T20 World Cup, with young quick Tanzim Hasan Sakib earning selection after two appearances against Zimbabwe.

Selectors also included left-arm quick Shoriful Islam, after the 22-year-old was rested for the final two matches with Zimbabwe. Afif Hossain Dhrubo and Hasan Mahmud will travel to the tournament as reserves.

Bangladesh are drawn in Group D alongside South Africa, Sri Lanka, Netherlands and Nepal for next month's event, with their first contest coming against Sri Lanka in Dallas on June 7.
