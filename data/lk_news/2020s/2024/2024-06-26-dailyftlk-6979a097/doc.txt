SF refutes Govt. crossover rumours and support for Ranil

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Chairperson MP Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka has said he will not support President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s Presidential candidacy.

Taking to ‘X’, Fonseka refuted rumours he will support the presidential candidacy of Ranil Wickremesinghe calling the reports “completely untrue and baseless”.

He also denied media reports, claiming he would join the Government shortly. A recent news report claimed Fonseka, along with opposition MPs Patali Champika Ranawaka and Dr. Rajitha Senaratne are poised to align themselves with President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

“I want to place it on record that this news is inaccurate. I will not be joining the Government,” he said. Fonseka urged all Sri Lankans to avoid propagating rumours.

He also said that he is prepared to face any challenge on behalf of the motherland, emphasising that it is time for Sri Lanka to move in the right political direction.

Rumours about Fonseka’s potential crossover to the Government are circulating as he faces possible disciplinary action by the SJB for criticising the party leadership. The SJB working committee is scheduled to meet this week to decide on the measures to be taken against Fonseka.

Meanwhile, MP Patali Champika Ranawaka also took to social media to deny cross-over rumours. “The relevant claims are baseless, and we have not taken any steps to accept ministerial positions,” he said. “As the United Republic Front, we will continue to maintain our commitment to solving the problems of the people without pursuing personal gains,” the MP added.
