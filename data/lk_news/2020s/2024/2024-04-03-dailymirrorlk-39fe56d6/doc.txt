Colombo, April 3 (Daily Mirror) - Research conducted by the government has revealed that more than 60 percent of the voters in Sri Lanka are still undecided on whom they should vote for, UNP Assistant Leader Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said yesterday.

Former Minister Kariyawasam told a press briefing that rumours of certain political parties expected to get a high percentage of votes is false.

At the same time he said that incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe will spring a surprise similar to one the country had during the 2015 Presidential election. "There are many things happening behind the scenes. Therefore don't come to conclusions seeing from the outside," he said in this regard.

"Many individuals and parties have pledged their support to President Wickremesinghe and they will make a move when the election is drawing near, " he also said.

Also he announced that the UNP will hold a May Day procession in front of Tower Hall this year.
