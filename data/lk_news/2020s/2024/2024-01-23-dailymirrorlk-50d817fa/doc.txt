Trade unionist representing CEB to be summoned before Parliament

Parliament, Jan. 23 (Daily Mirror)- Trade unionist representing employees of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) Ranjan Jayalal is to be summoned before Parliament shortly for making a false claim.

Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera proposed that trade unionist Ranjan Jayalal be summoned before Parliament for passing false information.

"Ranjan Jayalal had passed false information that Parliament and the President's office have not paid their electricity bills for months. Both institutions have paid their electricity bills to date. Therefore Jayalal should be dealt with by summoning him before Parliament," Minister Wijesekera said.
