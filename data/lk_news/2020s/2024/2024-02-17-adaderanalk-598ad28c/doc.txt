Chief Prelates raise concerns with President on state assets privatisation

The Chief Prelates of the three Buddhist Chapters have raised deep concerns about a potential risk of emerging social insecurity due to the privatisation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs).

They communicated this in a letter addressed to President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Saturday (Feb.17).

The letter states that the ongoing process of privatisation of SOEs has sparked concerns among the members of the public with regard to transparency and potential threats to public welfare and national security.

The Chief Prelates underscored that itâ€™s imperative for the government to address these issues and foster trust and stability in the country.
