Minister sounds warning to egg producers over prices

Minister of Trade Nalin Fernando has stated that it is possible to reduce the retail price of an egg to Rs. 40.

He warned that if egg producers fail to reduce prices for the festive season, the government will once again resort to importing eggs from India.

The minister further stated that the egg prices have suddenly dropped by Rs. 6 and that he will thoroughly look into this by obtaining reports from the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA).

He expressed concerns stating that if an egg cannot be sold for at least Rs. 40, they would have to import eggs from India. He pointed out that during the festival season in December, cake manufacturers will also be purchasing a large quantity of eggs.

Therefore, he emphasized that if the egg prices are not reduced by then, the government will have to import eggs or ensure customer protection by providing eggs at the correct price.
