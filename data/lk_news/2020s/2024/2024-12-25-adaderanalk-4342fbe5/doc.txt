Gazette issued on monthly payments to ‘Aswesuma’ beneficiaries in 2025

A Gazette notification has been issued announcing the monthly amounts to be paid to ‘Aswesuma’ welfare beneficiaries in 2025.

The previous ‘Aswesuma’ welfare benefit payment scheme, which was first issued on May 17, 2024, has now been rescinded.

However, payments under the previous scheme will continue until December 31, 2024, for beneficiaries whose payments have been delayed due to various reasons.

Additionally, applicants who are yet to be selected for the scheme will be entitled to payments once their eligibility is confirmed.

This includes those who have already submitted appeals, with investigations still underway to determine their qualifications for the welfare benefits.
