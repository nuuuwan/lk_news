In response, the diaspora has expressed their readiness to assist the Sri Lankan government in boosting economic development across various sectors, such as climate change and tourism.

Additionally, President’s Chief-of-Staff Sagala Ratnayaka has detailed plans for establishing the Office of Overseas Sri Lankans. He emphasized that this initiative would provide an avenue for the diaspora to engage constructively with the Government.

Ratnayaka also underscored the ongoing IMF program, emphasizing the importance of the diagnostics report released last year. He appealed for the continued backing of the Sri Lankan diaspora in carrying forward the reform program.

In attendance at the meeting was Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry who provided further insight into initiatives aimed at facilitating programs in Sri Lanka that are backed by Sri Lankan expatriates.

In response to various inquiries, the President has affirmed the government’s dedication to executing longstanding policies.

He also explained the efforts to revamp Sri Lanka’s education system, which includes plans for introducing private universities.

The Head of State on Thursday morning (Feb.08) embarked on a visit to Australia at the invitation of India Foundation and the Government of Australia to attend the 7th Indian Ocean Conference (IOC) in Perth.

The President’s Media Division (PMD) said Wickremesinghe will play a pivotal role in shaping discussions at the conference, slated as a vital forum for dialogue and cooperation within the Indian Ocean Region.

The event, themed “Towards a Stable and Sustainable Indian Ocean,” aims to foster cooperation among 40 participating nations. President Wickremesinghe’s participation reflects Sri Lanka’s proactive stance towards regional stability and development.

Accompanying the President is Foreign Minister Ali Sabry, who will address the plenary session titled “Our Blue Future: How can the Indian Ocean region work with island states to safeguard the health of our shared ocean resources”. Sabry’s participation highlights Sri Lanka’s focus on safeguarding shared ocean resources.

Organized by the India Foundation in collaboration with India’s Ministry of External Affairs and the Australian Government, along with support from the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Singapore, and Perth-US Asia Centre, the conference seeks to chart a roadmap for the region’s future.

Sri Lanka previously hosted the second edition of the IOC in 2017, under the patronage of Wickremesinghe, who was the then-Prime Minister.

Wickremesinghe’s attendance underscores Sri Lanka’s commitment to regional diplomacy and its active engagement in addressing common challenges for the collective benefit of Indian Ocean nations, the PMD added.

On the sidelines of the IOC, Wickremesinghe also called on Australia’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Penny Wong and the Premier of Western Australia, Roger Cook earlier today.
