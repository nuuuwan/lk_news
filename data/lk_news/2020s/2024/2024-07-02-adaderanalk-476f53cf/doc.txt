SC rules several clauses of Economic Transformation Bill are unconstitutional

The Supreme Court has determined that several clauses of the Economic Transformation Bill are inconsistent with the countryâ€™s Constitution.

Consequently, these clauses require a special majority in parliament and, in some cases, approval by a referendum to be passed.

However, if the contentious clauses are amended, they can be passed with a simple majority, the Speaker of Parliament announced today while delivering Supreme Court determination on the bill.
