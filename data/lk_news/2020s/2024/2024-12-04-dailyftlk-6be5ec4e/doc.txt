Cabinet approves new bill to recall and reopen nominations for LG polls

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved drafting a special bill enabling the recall of nominations submitted for the postponed 2023 Local Government Election.

The new legislation will also provide for fresh nominations, ensuring the rights of voters and the inclusion of youth candidates.

Addressing the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa stated this move safeguards the rights of all voters, while securing opportunities for youth participation in the election.

The proposal builds on a previous decision made at the Cabinet meeting on 2 September to instruct the Legal Draftsman to formulate the Local Government Election (Special Provisions) bill.

The bill aims to nullify the nominations called for the election initially scheduled for 2023 and create provisions for new nominations. A consensus to proceed with this approach was reached at a party leaders’ meeting chaired by the Speaker of Parliament on 25 November.

Dr. Jayatissa said the meeting underscored the importance of resetting the nomination process to ensure fair representation, particularly for youth candidates, in the upcoming elections.

He added that the legislation is necessary to uphold voters’ rights and to foster youth engagement in governance. “This initiative ensures the integrity of the electoral process and the opportunity for broader representation,” he added.
