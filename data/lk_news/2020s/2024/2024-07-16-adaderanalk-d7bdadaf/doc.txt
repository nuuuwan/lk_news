Prices of multiple food items reduced

The All-Ceylon Restaurant Owners’ Association says that a decision has been taken to reduce the prices of multiple food items effective from midnight today (16) as a result of the reduction in electricity tariffs.

President of the association Harshana Rukshan stated that accordingly the price of a normal rice parcel will go down by Rs. 25.

Meanwhile, prices of ‘Fried Rice’ and ‘Kottu’ will also be reduced by Rs. 25, while the prices of ‘Parathas’, ‘Egg Rotis’ and short eats will be reduced by Rs. 10.

Accordingly, he requested the restaurant owners to make necessary arrangements to provide this relief to all the customers across the island.
