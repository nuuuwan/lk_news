Sri Lanka gives on-arrival visa at airport, VFS Global e-visa site shut on court order

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has shut a electronic visa application site run by consortium involving companies called VFS Global, IVS and GBS, after a court order suspended the the contract awarded without competitive tender.

“We have been notified of certain interim orders issued by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka today pertaining to the agreement under which this platform is operated,” a statement on front page of the website said.

“In view of these orders, the website is suspended effective 2 August at 17:00 hours Sri Lanka Standard Time.”

The Department of Immigration continued to issue on arrival visas physically to tourists from eligible countries, airport officials said.

Court also ordered the status quo that prevailed before April 18, when the site was operated by Mobitel, a domestic company.

There was no immediate information on when the old site would be restored. Department sources said a decision is likely to be taken next week.

Mobitel was charging one dollar for the service while VFS Global was charging different prices ranging from 10 dollars to 18.5 dollars and more depending on the category of visa. (Colombo/Aug03/2024)
