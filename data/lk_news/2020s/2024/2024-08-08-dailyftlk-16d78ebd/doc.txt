Ceylon Chamber launches BCCS Awards 2024

The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce has announced the launch of the Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability (BCCS) Awards 2024 at a seminar to brief prospective applicants on the awards process for the year 2024.

Held this year for the 21st consecutive year, the BCCS Awards, which champion corporate sustainability in an increasingly environmentally vulnerable world, are one of the most anticipated events in the corporate calendar.

The briefing webinar was led by a veteran in the field of sustainability and Panel of Evaluators Chairman Rathika de Silva. Stressing the urgency of mainstreaming ESG practices in core business processes and corporate strategies, de Silva called upon companies to continue to raise the bar in incorporating ESG practices into their operations.

He was joined by Ravi De Silva, Prof. Sashika Manoratne, Daniel Dissanayaka, and Imalka Iddamalgoda.

The panel took participants through the application process, highlighting key areas in terms of presentation and submission with regard to the broad areas the awards consider, including environment, customer relations, community relations, employee relations and governance, financial performance, and economic contribution.

Azam Bakeer Markar briefed participants on the ‘Best Projects Sustainability Awards’ application. These awards highlight the efforts of the private and public sectors to develop and implement projects that promote one or more aspects of sustainability, and which demonstrate a contribution to the well-being of the people or the planet.

Applications for the BCCS Awards are now open, with the application forms, brochures, and other relevant documents accessible at www.chamber.lk.
