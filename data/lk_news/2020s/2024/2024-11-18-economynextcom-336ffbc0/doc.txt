Sri Lanka President says will not mis-use power, will expand freedoms

ECONOMYNEXT – A government of the National People’s Power will not misuse its two thirds mandate to harm Sri Lanka’s citizenry, but will work towards expanding their freedoms and equality, President Anura Dissanayake said after appointing 21 cabinet ministers.

The NPP candidates were elected to parliament from the North, South, East and West he said.

In the past, politics were done setting the South against the North, and North against the South, and promoting hate and distrust, he said.

“This election shows the divisive politics are no longer applicable,” President Dissanayake said.

It was very true that “power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely,” he said.

It had been shown in several occasions in Sri Lanka he said.

The NPP would be mindful of the responsibility it had in not misusing the mandate it had been given, he said.

In the past different people had been treated differently, based on geography, ethnicity or religion, he said.

It was the intention of the NPP to give opportunities for everyone to share in economic benefits.

It was the responsibility of the newly appointed ministers to ensure good governance and equal treatment of people, he said. (Colombo/Nov18/2014)
