SJB to bring no-confidence motion against Speaker?

A no-confidence motion will have to be brought against Speaker of the Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, since he has ignored nine recommendations given by the Supreme Court while enacting the Online Safety Act, says the Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa.

Addressing an event held in Galle today (Feb. 03), Premadasa said that they have no faith in the Speaker anymore.

“The Speaker has granted approval for the Online Safety Act in an unlawful manner. We carried out an analysis regarding the matter. The recommendations of the Supreme Court have been neglected on 09 instances”, he said.

“We have no confidence on the Speaker anymore. We will have to consider whether [the parliament] has confidence on the Speaker or not, in the future”, he added.

Meanwhile, the Opposition Leader warned that disciplinary action will be sought, regardless of their ranks, against the members of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) who criticizes the party while being part of it.
