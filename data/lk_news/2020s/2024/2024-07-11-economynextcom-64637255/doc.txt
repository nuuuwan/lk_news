Sri Lanka presidential election ‘most probably’ on October 5 or 12: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s presidential poll will be held this year on October 5 or 12, its Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabry said in parliament on Thursday.

“Do not doubt that the presidential election will be held between September 17 and October 17 this year. Most probably it will be held on either Saturday, October 5 or Saturday, October 12,” Sabry said.

“The president is not afraid to go before the people because he has accomplished something, he has a report card.

Based on that report card the people will decide. This government and the president have no intention to stay on a day extra.”

Parties afraid of an election and those who want to destabilise the country were spreading false information about the postponing of elections, Sabry said.
