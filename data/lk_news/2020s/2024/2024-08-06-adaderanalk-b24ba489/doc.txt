Govt. to integrate public sector IT systems to enhance efficiency

Cabinet approval has been granted for the integration of public sector information technology systems to enhance the efficiency and the quality of the public service.

Issuing a statement, the Department of Government Information (DGI) said that it has been recognised that it is necessary to integrate information technology systems existing in the public institutions including corporations and Statutory Boards to perform the functions effectively and optimistically through the verification of information and minimization of duplication of data with the objective of enhancement of efficiency and quality of the public service.

Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved the proposal furnished by President Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies to address four key issues which include the integration of information technology systems and data management across all government institutions.

- Making compulsory the use of a passport number for the identification of a foreigner

- Making compulsory the use of the business registration number and the national identity card numbers of the owners/members of the board of directors and the passport number of the foreign member.

- Standardization of data enabling the transfer of relevant data formally with other government institutions.
