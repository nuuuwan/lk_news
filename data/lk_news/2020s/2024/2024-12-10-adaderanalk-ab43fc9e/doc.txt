The United Nations Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka, Marc-André Franche, has expressed hope that the commitment expressed by the new government to protect human rights will be substantial and not merely a spectacle.

The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) marked International Human Rights Day with a ceremony at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) today, under the theme, “Our Rights, Our Future, Right Now.”
