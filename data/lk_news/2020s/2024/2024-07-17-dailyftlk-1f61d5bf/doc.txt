Govt. to launch second phase of agriculture modernisation program

Cabinet nod to utilise Rs. 750 m from 2024 Budget and provide Rs. 10 m for each of 75 selected Divisional Secretariat Divisions

In a significant step towards transforming the agricultural sector, the Government has decided the implementation of the second phase of the Agriculture Modernisation Program.

The second phase will involve the selection of three Divisional Secretariats in each district to implement modern agricultural projects.

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the proposal presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to utilise Rs. 750 million from the 2024 Budget for this phase.

“This Budget allocation will provide Rs. 10 million for each of the 75 selected Divisional Secretariat Divisions,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

The move follows the Cabinet decision taken on 4 March 2024, following the successful launch of the program’s first phase.

Gunawardena said the initiative aims to promote sustainable and smart agricultural practices, enhance productivity and ensure food security in Sri Lanka.

“By focusing on modernisation, the Government intends to equip farmers with advanced technology, improved farming techniques and better infrastructure. This approach is expected to boost crop yields, reduce post-harvest losses, and increase the profitability of farming activities,” he added.

The second phase will build on the foundation laid by the initial phase, which focused on introducing innovative agricultural methods and providing training to farmers.

The Agriculture Modernisation Program is part of a broader strategy to revitalise the rural economy, create employment opportunities and improve the standard of living for those engaged in agriculture.
