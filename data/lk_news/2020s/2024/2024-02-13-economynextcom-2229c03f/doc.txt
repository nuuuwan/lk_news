Sri Lanka to begin pilot project with Microsoft to teach AI in schools

ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka’s cabinet of ministers has approved a proposal to introduce courses on artificial intelligence (AI) to the school curriculum, with a pilot project with support from Microsoft set to begin from grade 8 upwards.

A statement from the Government Information Department said on Tuesday February 13 that President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity of Minister of Technology and Minister of Education Susil Premajayantha have proposed that the project is carried out in schools where “the necessary basic human resources are available”.

Among the proposals is to revise the international syllabus currently implemented by Microsoft based on the recommendations of the National Institute of Educational and commence the proposed pilot projects from grade 8 in schools where the necessary basic human resources are available.

Digitisation of schools selected for the pilot project under the facilities provided by Microsoft and providing training to 100 Information and Communication Technology (ICT)  teachers as trainers by Microsoft are also proposed.

According to the statement, the project had originally proposed last year based on  recommendations made by a task force appointed for the formation of a national strategy on AI.

National Institute of Education Director General Sunil Jayantha Nawarathna told EconomyNext at the time that such subjects should be taught to students from grades 6 to 13 “depending on their level”. Plans were also underway in May 2023 to encourage students to large language model (LLM) tools such as ChatGPT and Google Bard to enhance their knowledge with respect to other subjects by 2024.

Other ambitions plans included using AI to teach subjects like Science and Information Technology (IT).

Minister Premajayantha said in November that digitisation of Sri Lanka’s education system will be completed in 2024.

“All schools will be digitized from Grade 1 onwards starting from the reopening of schools in March or April.”

For this, both teachers and principals will have to be trained starting now, Premajayantha said at the time. (Colombo/Feb13/2024)
