Additionally, 85 online vendor partners will offer discounts to ComBank credit and debit card holders during the promotion period, while another 14 participating merchant partners will offer easy payment plans of upto 60 months on white goods purchased during the promotion period.

The Bank said the participating merchant partners represent a wide spectrum of products and services from leading local and international brands, as well as varying price points, to ensure that the promotion caters to the largest possible customer base.

Concurrent with the ‘Avurudu’ card promotion, Commercial Bank has launched a separate promotion exclusively for the Bank’s debit card holders, offering them a chance to win gifts worth Rs. 6 million.
