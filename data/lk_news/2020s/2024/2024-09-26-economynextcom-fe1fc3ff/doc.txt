Sri Lanka missions in Lebanon and Israel on alert: MFA

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s missions in Beirut, Lebanon and Tel Aviv, Israel are on alert to ensure the safety of its citizens in affected areas, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.

“Given the volatile situation in Lebanon and Israel, Sri Lanka Missions in Beirut and Tel Aviv are on alert and working towards ensuring the safety of Sri Lankans in the affected areas.”

No Sri Lankans have been affected by the situation so far, the ministry said in its statement.

Israel has intensified its attacks on Lebanon, even as it continues to pulverize the Palestine territory of Gaza, with foreign media reporting the latest attacks in Lebanon killed 72.

Sri Lanka’s former Minister of Foreign Affairs said last month, when the ministry cautioned Sri Lankans against visiting Lebanon, that around 6,000 Sri Lankans currently reside there.
