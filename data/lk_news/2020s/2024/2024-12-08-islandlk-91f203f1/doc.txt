Dr. P. A. Kiriwandeniya reviews progress of ‘Sanasa Forward’ in Hambantota

Dr. P. A. Kiriwandeniya, Founder of Sanasa and Chancellor of Wayamba University of Sri Lanka, recently evaluated the progress of the “Sanasa Forward” initiative in Hambantota. This programme, launched 18 months ago, aims to empower 5,000 villages across the country through production-based economic activities over the next five years.

In Hambantota, projects under Tangalle and Pahajjawa Sanasa societies, including water bottling, farming, vehicle repair, and bakery ventures, showcased promising results. Funded and guided by Sanasa’s loans and expertise, these initiatives highlight the programme’s success in fostering local economic growth.

During his visit, Dr. Kiriwandeniya engaged with community members and Sanasa staff to discuss further improvements. Similar reviews are planned countrywide, with Sanasa General Society and Sanasa Life and General Insurance supporting the programme’s expansion.
