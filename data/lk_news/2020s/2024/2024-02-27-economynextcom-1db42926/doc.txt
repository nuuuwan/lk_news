Sri Lanka aiming for US$200mn ADB water sector loans: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is working with the Asian Development Bank to get 200 million US dollars of loans, linked to water sector reforms, Minister of Water Supply, Jeevan Thondaman said.

The funds will come as a policy based loan in subprogram 1 and another 100 million dollars under sub program II, he said.

“Seventy five percent of our reforms are complete and we are sure we would be able to carry it forward,” Minister Thondaman told reporters in Colombo.

Sri Lanka’s National Water Supply and Drainage Board has unremunerated water (losses) which authorities have been trying to cut for many years.

The NSWDB had also borrowed dollar loans in the past. (Colombo/Feb27/2024)
