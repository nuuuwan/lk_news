Global reputation expert to speak on vital topic for corporate and political leaders

In a world that has lurched from VUCA to RUPT, how can businesses navigate the complexities of managing Reputation, Risk and Regulation?

The answers that leaders need – to rethink, reframe and lead through the turbulence they are experiencing, may be forthcoming at a timely talk in Colombo by Ashwani Singla, a globally-renowned reputation management specialist.

Titled ‘Negotiating the Complex landscape of Reputation, Risk & Regulation in a RUPTured World,’ the thought leadership event is presented by the Public Relations Association of Sri Lanka (PRASL) as its first event for 2024, and takes place at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel, the event’s Hospitality Partner, at 6 pm on Tuesday, 30th January.

The speaker Ashwani Singla, is the Founding Managing Partner of Astrum, India’s first specialist reputation management advisory, which offers science-based reputation management solutions for C-Suite and Political leaders. He is the Co-founder and former Chief Executive of Burson-Marsteller India, and was a member of the global giant’s Asia-Pacific Board. He also served as Asia MD of Penn Schoen and Berland (PSB), where he used voter insights to guide the Campaign Committee of the BJP as its campaign strategist and delivered a historic victory in 2014, in addition to maintaining a clean sweep of several state elections over the last decade.

In his presentation, Singla will answer daunting questions such as: How do we sustain and protect reputation in a naked world, where everything is visible, when the space for dialogue is shrinking, when machines become more powerful than the average Jane or Joe, and when governments cannot keep up with innovation and disruptions? How, as the conscience-keepers of organisations, do PR professionals and Corporate Communications specialists help companies sustain and protect their reputations and license to operate?

These questions are particularly of interest to businesses in Sri Lanka as the country begins a year that is projected to be extra challenging with national elections, arduous economic reforms and low growth on the cards.

Tickets for the event are priced at Rs 7,500 for members of PRASL and their invitees and at Rs 9,000 for non-members.

The Public Relations Association of Sri Lanka was formally launched in 2023 to address a long-felt need to give voice to the industry, infuse high standards, and develop the skills of professional practitioners. The Association’s objectives include gaining recognition for PR practice and enhancing its influence, fostering high professional standards and ethical practices as a valued PR industry, and bringing together and representing public relations practitioners. PRASL also aims to provide thought leadership events and networking opportunities for members to exchange ideas and professional experiences, all while keeping the interests of its members and the wider society in mind.
