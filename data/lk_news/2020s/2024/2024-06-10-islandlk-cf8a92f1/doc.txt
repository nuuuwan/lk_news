Despite its low credit risk, trade finance involves significant operational risks, necessitating highly skilled and continuously trained personnel. The Trade Finance Association of Bankers (TFAB), celebrating its 26th anniversary, addresses this need by enhancing the expertise of trade finance professionals.

TFAB’s dedication to professional development is evident through its annual seminars, evening lectures, and interactive programs. These initiatives ensure that bankers, importers, exporters, lawyers, and business leaders stay updated on global practices and regulatory developments, fostering a spirit of goodwill and collaboration within the industry.
