Durdans Hospital reaffirms once again its position as a leader in healthcare by securing the Joint Commission International, USA (JCI) re-accreditation for the third time.

While symbolising Durdans Hospital’s unwavering commitment to excellence in patient care and safety, this achievement also highlights Sri Lanka’s appeal as a destination for medical tourism. With Sri Lanka experiencing a tourism boom and enjoying a robust, affordable, and reliable healthcare sector led by institutions like Durdans Hospital, the country is gaining a growing reputation for medical tourism.

The JCI re-accreditation process involved a comprehensive evaluation by expert surveyors who measured over 1,200 elements of the hospital’s processes and operations, covering areas such as patient care, safety protocols, hospital operations, and governance.

Accordingly, Durdans Hospital was honoured with re-accreditation thanks to its implementation of advanced patient safety protocols, continuous quality improvement initiatives, comprehensive staff training programs, and a commitment to patient-centred care. These efforts ensure that every aspect of patient care at Durdans is aligned with international best practices, contributing to superior clinical outcomes, patient safety, and operational efficiency.

Durdans Hospital Chief Operating Officer Mahanil Perera commented: “Our ability to receive JCI re-accreditation is a result of the smart work and dedication of our entire team. It highlights our ongoing commitment to excellence in healthcare and our unwavering focus on patient safety and quality care. We are honoured to be recognised once again by the Gold Seal in healthcare from the JCI, USA. It also gives Sri Lanka recognition on the global map as a medical tourist destination, giving high suitability for foreign nationals to visit the country for medical treatment purposes.”

Quality Assurance Senior Manager Nishadi Vithanage added: “We are dedicated to meeting and exceeding all quality standards, which is reflected in this achievement. Our focus remains on delivering world-class healthcare services and continuously improving our protocols to meet the evolving needs of our patients.”

With a focus on delivering personalised and compassionate care, Durdans Hospital is well-prepared to cater to the needs of its patients – both local and foreign. The hospital’s advanced medical facilities, highly professional staff, and adherence to rigorous quality standards make it an attractive option for those seeking reliable and affordable medical care.

Having received JCI re-accreditation, Durdans Hospital is poised to position Sri Lanka as a prime destination for medical tourism, supporting the national economy and attracting new foreign currency revenue streams.
