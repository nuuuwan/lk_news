‘We haven’t corrected our recurring mistakes yet’ – Wanindu

As Sri Lanka bids farewell to the 2024 T20 World Cup, Captain Wanindu Hasaranga emphasized the importance of accountability in the face of defeat.

Speaking to the media following their final match in the tournament, Hasaranga stated that although it is easy to blame the pitch or other factors after losing matches, players should adapt them as professional cricketers.

“At first I should say that we are really sorry for our performance. As a team, we know the capabilities of our team, but unfortunately, we did not perform well in the first two matches. Though we won this match, it is too late to change the outcome now”, he expressed.

The Sri Lankan skipper further said: “We talked about our mistakes from both the last World Cup and this tournament, but we haven’t corrected the mistakes yet.”

“After losing matches, we can blame the pitch and many other factors. I think it is not a good thing to do as professional cricketers. The opposing team plays on the same pitch, so we should not use it as an excuse. We should adapt”.

“As the captain, I, along with the team, accept full responsibility for this defeat”, he added.
