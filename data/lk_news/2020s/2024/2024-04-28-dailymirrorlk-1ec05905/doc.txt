Sri Lanka go on top of Group A of Women’s T20 World Cup Qualifier

The second matchday of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup Qualifier 2024 witnessed the Netherlands, Uganda and Zimbabwe record important first wins while Sri Lanka made it two wins in two.

Sri Lanka produced an utterly dominant performance against Scotland to move to the top of Group A in the Global Qualifier.

Asked to bat first by the Islanders, UAE had no answers to the Sri Lankan spinners, who accounted for nine of the 10 wickets that fell. Inoshi Priyadharshani made a crucial breakthrough in the very first over, dismissing Darcey Carter for a duck to set the tone for Sri Lanka's dominance.

Despite losing an early wicket, Kathryn Bryce emerged was undeterred and launched an attack during the Powerplay, striking two boundaries off Udeshika Prabodhani in an over. She dished out the same treat to Sugandika Kumari but the left-arm spinner had the last laugh by getting rid of the opposition skipper two balls later.

Achini Kulasuriya struck in her first over and the last over of the Powerplay to leave Scotland reeling at 32/3.

Kavisha Dilhari was soon introduced into the attack and picked up four of the remaining five wickets. For Scotland, a solid knock of 24 from Lorna Jack took them to a respectable total as they were bowled out for 94.

Scotland's target of 95 proved insufficient as they were dismantled right in the Powerplay by Sri Lanka's captain Chamari Athapaththu.

The left-hander unleashed a barrage of aggressive strokes from the outset, racing to 41 runs off just 23 balls within the first six overs, ruthlessly dismantling the Scottish bowling attack with seven boundaries and a six.

She needed only eight more balls to get to her half-century – the 10th of her T20I career – as Athapaththu (59* off 35 balls) kept the foot firmly on the accelerator with a massive boost to their net run rate in sight.

Meanwhile, Vishmi Gunaratne played a supportive role with a composed unbeaten knock of 23 runs off 25 balls, as Sri Lanka cruised to victory with all 10 wickets intact and 59 balls to spare.
