Unique blend of versatility, professionalism and passion

I’m 24 years in old and I have an elder sister. I started modelling at the age of 16, after my O/Ls. I also completed my High National Diploma for business management, while doing higher studies in fashion designing, and textile, as my ambition is to be a fashion designer. I’m also a social media influencer. I’m a very positive-minded person, working hard to achieve my goals. I enjoy spending time with myself, and with people I love. Oh, and I love the beach.

Actually, this happened unexpectedly. Believe me, I never thought of becoming a model because I always wanted to be a fashion designer. After my O/Ls, my sister wanted me to do modelling, and then I joined the Brian Kerkoven Academy in 2016 and that’s how my modelling journey began. Brian has been a great inspiration to me, recognizing my potential and providing me with the opportunity to showcase my talents and abilities, and making me a part of the BK Model Management.

I would say my unique blend of versatility, professionalism, and passion. I can adapt to different styles and bring a dynamic presence to every shoot. My commitment to staying fit, and updated on fashion trends, ensures I deliver my best…always.

As a model, I prefer to model high fashion and couture clothing. The intricate designs and unique styles allow me to showcase a wide range of expressions and poses, making each photo shoot an exciting and creative experience. Additionally, wearing high-end, beautifully crafted garments provides a sense of elegance and sophistication that I enjoy portraying.

05. What do you think is the most important aspect of modeling?

I would say confidence, as confidence would allow you to literally own the runway, captivate the camera, and convey the essence of the brand you represent. Confidence not only makes you feel comfortable, on the runway, but it also enables you to take on diverse roles and challenges, making you versatile and a compelling figure in the fashion industry .

06. If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?

Believe me, I have nothing to change about myself. I’m quite satisfied with myself. Yet, if I could change one thing about myself, it would be my anger. Yes, it would be ideal if I could get rid of my anger. Other than that, there is nothing else. I’m pretty delighted with myself.

I studied at St. Anne’s Convent, in Wattala. I was a netball player and did swimming, as well, during my school days.

Not possible to pick just one, but I would say right on top of the list would be my modelling career, and one of my biggest, happiest moments was when I got selected for Colombo Fashion Week.

Let’s say living a life filled with love and purpose. It means having supportive relationships, pursuing fulfilling goals, and maintaining a healthy balance life. To me, perfect happiness also includes inner peace, good health and the freedom to explore new experiences. One must remember that life is unpredictable and we don’t know what could happen to us…the very next moment.

Where I’m concerned, an ideal guy is someone who is matured, understanding, kind, supportive and respectful, and share similar interest. It’s important that he is honest, caring and makes me feel appreciated and loved.

My parents, of course. My amma and appachchi have always been my biggest supporters, showering me with unconditional love and guidance. Their hard work, resilience, and dedication to our family inspire me every day. They’ve taught me the values of kindness, integrity, and perseverance, and I strive to embody these qualities in my own life.

13. If you were marooned on a desert island, who would you like as your companion?

If such a scene comes up, I would like to be with my loved ones and my school mates because I am confident, with their help, we would be able to work our way to freedom.

Oh, I’ve had plenty of embarrassing moments, and I’ll share one with you. I went for a meeting, held at a public place, and everyone was silent. I then picked up my phone to check my notification. Suddenly, my Instagram opened, and it played a video with music. Obviously, everyone looked at me and I was so embarrassed.

My ideal vacation is a trip down south and spend my time on the beach as I’m a beach lover.

It depends on my mood, but I like techno and RnB. Music always puts me in a good mood, and I also pay attention to the lyrics of the song.

I used to listen to YFM and SUN FM but I’m not a radio fan anymore

I don’t have a favourite TV station but love watching romantic movies, comedies, cartoons.

I’ve fulfilled my biggest dream of becoming a supermodel in Sri Lanka and I now need to maintain that position. I also want to complete my studies and make sure that all my dreams, and plans, become a reality in the near future.
