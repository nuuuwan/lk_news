Three railway employees, suspended over alleged assault, reinstated

The three railway employees, who were suspended from service for allegedly assaulting two foreign nationals, have been reinstated pending disciplinary action.

A contentious situation had ensued at the Nawalapitiya railway station on Tuesday (March 05) after two foreigners were found to have been travelling in the first-class compartment of the Badulla-bound ‘Podi Menike’ express train without tickets.

Subsequently, the Railway Department suspended the services of two Station Masters (Class 2) and a Railway Guard for allegedly assaulting the two tourists.

The suspension imposed on the three employees has thus been lifted after a preliminary inquiry.

However, the suspension of the security officer attached to the Nawalapitiya railway station continues to be in place, the Railway Department added.
