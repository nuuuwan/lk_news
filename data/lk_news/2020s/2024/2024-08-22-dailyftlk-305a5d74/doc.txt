President cannot avoid defeat by recruiting MPs from other parties: Mujibur

Claims numerous conspiracies are ongoing against SJB leader Sajith Premadasa to ensure his defeatSays Thalatha Athukorala’s resignation speech hints at who she plans to align with going forward

Opines Athukorala’s decision to resign from MP post was incorrect

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Mujibur Rahuman stated yesterday that President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s defeat in the upcoming Presidential election cannot be avoided by recruiting MPs from other parties.

Addressing a press conference in Colombo, he also noted that numerous conspiracies are ongoing against SJB leader Sajith Premadasa to ensure his defeat at the elections.

Commenting on SJB MP Thalatha Athukorala’s sudden decision to step down from her Parliamentary post, Marikkar noted that she mentioned in her resignation speech her intention to continue in politics. “It hints at who she plans to align with moving forward,” he said.

Mujibur noted that Athukorala had previously worked well with Premadasa and supported the efforts to form the SJB. “There was no wrongdoing towards her by the party. I believe she made an incorrect decision,” he said.

He also stated that Wickremesinghe’s defeat in the upcoming 21 September election cannot be prevented by recruiting MPs from other parties. He explained that allocations for SJB MPs who did not support Wickremesinghe’s Presidential bid have been reduced, and provisions were made to encourage MPs to back the President. “Those who do not support the President have had their allocations cut,” he added. Mujibur stated that while Ranil Wickremesinghe can tolerate Anura Kumara Dissanayake winning, he cannot accept Sajith Premadasa’s victory. He accused Wickremesinghe of harbouring a strong animosity towards Premadasa and suggested that numerous conspiracies are being orchestrated to prevent Premadasa from winning.
