Opposition claims Sri Lanka has signed only two out of three debt agreements

ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka has signed only two out of three bilateral debt agreements, chief opposition whip Laksham Kiriella claimed.

Speaking to reporters outside parliament on Monday July 01, he said there would be no point debating the agreement since it was incomplete. He was responding to questions on why a debate scheduled for Tuesday July 02 on the debt deal was postponed.

“They said the agreements signed by the government would not be presented tomorrow. We noted that though the government said they had signed those agreements, they actually hadn’t. There are three agreements. Two of them have been signed. The third hasn’t been signed yet.

“There is no point having a debate without the third agreement, beacause it is the third agreement that reveals the whole picture,” said Kiriella.

Parliament’s business committee met on Monday where it was decided that President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s address to parliament on debt restructuring will be held as scheduled, though the debate would be postponed.

Deputy Speaker Ajith Rajapaksha told reporters that only the president’s speech would be held on Tuesday.

The debate following the president’s speech was originally scheduled to be held on July 02 and 03.
