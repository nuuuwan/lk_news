Three cops arrested for bribery to halt action against selling sexual stimulants

In a startling turn of events, three police officers from the Sapugaskanda Police, including a sergeant and two constables, were arrested today on suspicion of accepting a bribe amounting to Rs. 150,000 to stop proceeding with legal action against the sale of aphrodisiacs (a food, drink, or other thing that stimulates sexual desire) by an Ayurvedic medicine dealer.

The saga began when the medicine dealer filed a complaint with the Sapugaskanda Police, claiming that the officers had conducted a raid on his shop. During the raid, they seized a bottle they purportedly identified as containing an aphrodisiac. However, instead of pursuing legal action, the officers allegedly demanded a hefty sum of Rs. 150,000 from the dealer to refrain from escalating the matter.

According to the complaint, the payment was made via the dealer's ATM card as a means to silence the officers. The suspects, originating from Monaragala, Morapitiya, and Walasmulla areas, found themselves in hot water as investigations ensued.

The OIC Crime Investigation Unit of the Kelaniya division, under the directives of SSP Kelaniya Division, spearheaded the investigation that led to the arrest of the three officers.

Aphrodisiacs, substances purported to enhance sexual desire or performance, have long been a subject of intrigue and controversy. While some view them as harmless aids, others raise concerns about their efficacy and potential side effects. This case sheds light on the murky intersection of law enforcement and the sale of such products, emphasizing the need for transparency and accountability within the police force. The suspects were slated to appear before the Mahara Magistrate for further legal proceedings.
