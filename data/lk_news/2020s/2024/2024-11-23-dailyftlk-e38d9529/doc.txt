Dr. P. A. Kiriwandeniya observes the progress of ‘Sanasa Forward’ (Sanasa Idiriya) projects in Hambantota

Sanasa Founder and the Chancellor of Wayamba University of Sri Lanka Vishwa Prasadini, Dr. P. A. Kiriwandeniya recently observed the projects launched in Hambantota under ‘Sanasa Forward’ program. This program seeks to uplift communities across Sri Lanka through production-based economic concepts over the next five years. Launched one and half years ago, the Sanasa Forward initiative is being rolled out nationwide to empower 5,000 villages under 1,250 selected Sanasa societies.

As part of this program, various projects such as water bottling, farming, vehicle repair, and bakery operations have been successfully launched in villages associated with the Tangalle and Pahajjawa Sanasa societies. These initiatives are funded and guided by loans and expertise provided by Sanasa, and were specially reviewed by Dr. Kiriwandeniya. He joined this observation tour, discussing improvements with local residents and the Sanasa staff. Looking ahead, he plans to observe the progress of similar projects under Sanasa Forward throughout the island. Sanasa General Society, and Sanasa Life and General Insurance companies are also scheduled to take part in the visits.
