Govt. amps up funding for Nanu Oya Railway Station modernisation

The Government has decided to provide additional funding for the Nanu Oya Railway Station modernisation project, which aims to enhance the station’s facilities to boost tourism and improve passenger experiences.

The move follows a previous Cabinet decision made on 3 April 2023. Initially, the project was set to be implemented with a budget of Rs. 74.63 million, funded by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) and the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTDA).

However, the contract value has now increased to Rs. 101.81 million due to rising costs and expanded project scope.

The proposal for the increased funding was presented by the Tourism and Land Minister Harin Fernando on Monday allowing the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB) to complete the modernisation activities.

The additional amount required will be sourced from the SLTDA and the SLTPB based on recommendations from the Department of Railway.

“The modernisation of the Nanu Oya Railway Station is expected to significantly enhance its infrastructure, making it more accommodating for tourists and locals alike,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing.
