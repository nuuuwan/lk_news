Ravi K.’s National List appointment sparks tensions within NDF

UNP calls emergency meeting and moves to take disciplinary action against Ravi Karunanayake

Alleges Karunanayake’s appointment as National List MP has bypassed UNP’s decision-making process

National Unity Alliance appeals to EC to withhold Gazette announcement of Karunanayake’s appointment

NUA describes nomination as unlawful and lacking consensus among alliance members

United National Party (UNP) members gathered for an emergency meeting yesterday evening at the Sirikotha to address the controversial nomination of former MP Ravi Karunanayake to the National List of the New Democratic Front (NDF).

The move, reportedly made without the party’s approval, has sparked internal dissent and calls for disciplinary action.

The NDF has secured two National List seats. Initially, it was reported the NDF had planned to allocate one seat to the UNP and the other to the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), which had aligned with former President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The nomination of Karunanayake, allegedly orchestrated by the NDF Secretary and communicated directly to the Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL), bypassed the UNP’s decision-making process.

The UNP had initially planned to meet today to finalise its nominations for the National List.

However, following the media’s exposure of Karunanayake’s nomination, senior UNP members urged Wickremesinghe to address the issue immediately. The emergency meeting was convened to deliberate on potential disciplinary measures against Karunanayake and chart the party’s next steps.

UNP Working Committee Member Dinouk Colombage has confirmed that the party has not yet decided who it will nominate to the National List. He emphasised that the final decision was to be made during the alliance meeting scheduled for today.

Meanwhile, the National Unity Alliance (NUA), a constituent member of the NDF, has appealed to the ECSL to withhold the Gazette announcement of Karunanayake’s appointment.  In a letter to the Commission, the NUA described the nomination as unlawful and lacking consensus among alliance members. The party has vowed to initiate legal action to challenge the move.
