Drought risk looms large

Amidst growing concerns over an anticipated drought, the Defence Ministry has announced plans to mitigate potential damages, according to an official statement released yesterday.

Forecasts from the Meteorological Department indicate that while there may be sporadic rainfall expected towards the end of March and into April, it is projected to be of diminished volume, exacerbating the looming drought conditions. In response, the Disaster Management Centre has proactively devised strategies to confront the impending crisis.

State Minister of Defence Premitha Bandara Tennakoon, underscored the grave consequences of the dry spell, highlighting the heightened risks of wildlife poaching and forest fires. Tennakoon issued a stern plea to citizens, urging them to abstain from engaging in such harmful activities.

He called upon the authorities concerned including the Forest Conservation Department, Wildlife Department, and Police to enforce stringent penalties against individuals found culpable of starting forest fires.

Identifying regions such as the North Central, North West, Western, Sabaragamuwa, and Southern provinces as particularly susceptible to heat stress, Thennakoon stressed the importance of preparedness. Disaster relief service centres stand ready to identify and address areas facing potential shortages of drinking water in dry regions.

The Defence Ministry remains steadfast in its commitment to preemptively tackle the impacts of the impending drought, emphasizing the imperative of responsible environmental stewardship during this critical juncture. Citizens are urged to cooperate with authorities to ensure the preservation of vital natural resources amidst the challenging conditions.
