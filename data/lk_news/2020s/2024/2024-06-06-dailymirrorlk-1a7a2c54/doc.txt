Lack of modern equipment prevented accurate forecast of inclement weather

Lack of proper equipment prevented accurate forecast of the recent inclement weather conditions, geologist Professor Athula Senaratne said yesterday.

“It would have been possible to issue prior warning of 400mm rains which some parts of the nation experienced during the past few days if the necessary equipment was available,” Professor Senaratne told journalists in Kandy.

He also said Sri Lanka does not have proper equipment to measure rainfall.
