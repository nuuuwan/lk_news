University non-academic staff members’ strike continues

The trade union action launched by the non-academic staff members of state universities has entered the second consecutive day. Accordingly, the strike will be continued until 4.30 p.m. today.

Non-academic staffers of all 17 state universities launched the token strike at noon yesterday (March 12) in protest of the authorities’ failure to rectify their salary increments as promised at the January 22 meeting.

“If the authorities do not provide us with a solution, we will resort to an indefinite strike starting next week,” the co-secretary of the Inter University Trade Union Federation, K. L. D. G. Richmond said commenting on the matter.
