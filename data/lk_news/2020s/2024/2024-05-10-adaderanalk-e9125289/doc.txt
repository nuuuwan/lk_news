Sri Lanka Cricket increases player fees across all formats

Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) announced that it has increased player fees for all categories of Sri Lanka’s international players with immediate effect.

Issuing a statement, SLC stated that accordingly, 41 players will be offered new contracts under six categories, namely, A1, A2, B2, C1, C2, and ’A’ Team.

Under the latest raise, match fees for the Test format have been increased by 100 percent, while payments will be made on merit basis, the SLC said.

There will be different payment structures for a Test match ‘won’, ‘drawn’ or ‘lost’, it added.

In the meantime, match fees for both ODI and T20I have been raised by 25 percent.

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Cricket has also decided to recognize the players who become top-ranked in the ICC Player Rankings.

Accordingly, a player will be financially rewarded with a one-time payment if they become the ‘Best Batsman, Best Bowler, or Best All-Rounder’ based on ICC rankings, covering all formats.

In the meantime, if a player attains a ranking between 10th and 2nd place in the ICC rankings in the aforesaid categories, such players will also be recognized with a one-time payment, according to SLC.

Additionally, daily allowances and per diems for all contracted players have been enhanced to provide better support during national team’s inbound and outbound engagements.

Furthermore, SLC stated that this decision was taken by Sri Lanka Cricket’s Executive Committee, headed by President of the SLC Shammi Silva in order to reflect the SLC’s commitment to supporting and valuing the national players equally across all formats.
