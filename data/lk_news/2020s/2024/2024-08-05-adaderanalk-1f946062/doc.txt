EC refutes reports claiming voters can cast votes at any polling station

The Election Commission emphasizes that false information is circulating alleging that the voters registered in the voter’s list will be facilitated to cast their vote at any polling station in the island.

Issuing a statement, the election regulatory body refuted these reports and said that the voters must vote at the polling station assigned to their registered constituency only, as per election regulations.

Additionally, postal voters retain the option to cast their vote in the presence of their Certifying Officer, providing a measure of convenience for those unable to visit their designated polling station, the statement added.

In preparation for the upcoming election, the Commission will send official ballot notices to registered voters. These notices will include the voter’s name, the address of the polling station where they are eligible to vote, and detailed voting instructions, the commission said.

The Election Commission emphasizes that no one is allowed to vote in a polling station other than the polling station mentioned in the ballot notice.

However, on July 26, the election commission had published an extraordinary gazette notification stating that a person who is reasonably fearful that he will not be able to go to and cast the vote at the given polling station, may request to be facilitated to vote at another polling station.

The gazette notification highlighted that the provisions of Section 119B of the Presidential Elections Act, No. 15 of 1981, as amended by the Presidential Elections (Amendment) Act, No. 16 of 1988, have provided in this regard.
