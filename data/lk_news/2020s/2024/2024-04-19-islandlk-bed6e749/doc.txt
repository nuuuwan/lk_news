Bath Spa University unveils new London campus

This month an international recruitment team from Bath Spa visited India and Sri Lanka to promote Bath Spa University London (BSUL) and the newly launched Postgraduate Master Courses which are offered at the London Site.

The Bath Spa University team visited India and Sri Lanka between the 21st and 27th February, covering three cities in India (Delhi, Chandigarh, and Hyderabad) and Colombo in Sri Lanka. The visit underscores Bath Spa University’s commitment to fostering educational collaborations with associates and providing Indian students with access to high-quality education in the UK.

Bath Spa University is a public University in Bath, England, in the United Kingdom. Currently the University has almost 10,000 students studying between five campuses in total, including the newly launched London site (BSUL).

The courses offered at BSUL are the MBA Leadership and MA Business and Management. The MA Business and Management degree provides you with a broad introduction to the fundamental principles of business and management in a rapidly changing, increasingly globalized world. The MBA degree in Leadership develops your talent and potential as a creative, innovative, and enterprising leader as well as your theoretical understanding and professional expertise in strategic management and leadership.

“Bath Spa’s flexible timetables allow the student to fit full-time study around other commitments by studying two full days a week or three-four evenings a week. The teaching is interactive, practical, and engaging and students will benefit from the deep knowledge and industry experience of the academic staff. Our students are diverse with a mix of backgrounds, ages, and life experiences, giving you a dynamic peer-to-peer learning experience, a Bath Spa press release said.
