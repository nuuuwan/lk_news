Public Security Minster Tiran Alles has vowed to eradicate all organised crime syndicates and drug trafficking rackets in the country by the end of June this year.

Speaking at an event in Negombo, Minister Alles emphasised that the ongoing country-wide anti-drug operation ‘Yukthiya’ will not be brought to a halt, regardless of any external pressures calling for the end of the special operation.

Meanwhile, Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon, who was also present at the event, revealed that the price of drugs being sold in Sri Lanka has hiked up exponentially, adding that prompt efforts are underway to confiscate all properties belonging to drug traffickers.
