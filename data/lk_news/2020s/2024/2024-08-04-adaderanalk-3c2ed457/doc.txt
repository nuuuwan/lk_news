Murder-suicide suspected as 4 including 2 cops killed in separate shootings

Four individuals including two police officers attached to the same police station in the Moneragala area as well as a mother and her daughter have reportedly been killed in separate shooting incidents this morning (04), which are believed to be interconnected.

The shooting incidents have reportedly taken place in the Moneragala, Namal Oya and Inginiyagala areas.

The deceased police officers were attached to the Karandugala Police Station in Moneragala, the Police Media Division said.

Initially it was reported that a 33-year-old policeman has been shot dead at his residence in the Namal Oya area of Ampara early this morning (Aug 04).

Police said that an unidentified assailant who arrived at the deceased police constableâ€™s house at around 02.45 a.m. today had shot at him and fled the scene.

Furthermore, police revealed that a 54-year-old woman and her 17-year-old daughter had also been shot dead at the Nelliadda area in Inginiyagala.

In a separate incident, another policeman attached to the same police station as the deceased officer had taken his own life by shooting himself to death using his service firearm inside the Karandugala Police Station today.

However, police suspect that the 42-year-old police constable who had committed suicide inside the police station had carried out both the previous shootings, which killed the 33-year-old cop and the two females, before taking his own life.
