Paid Rs. 3,000 re-connection fee two months ago: MP contradicts Kanchana

Parliament, March 7 (Daily Mirror)- Contradicting the Power and Energy Minister's claim that the electricity re-connection fee was reduced to Rs. 800 this year, newly appointed Anuradhapura District MP M.C. Muthukumarana said he paid Rs. 3,000 as reconnection fee two months ago.

MP Muthukumarana told this in Parliament after Minister Kanchana Wijesekara said that the reconnection fee which was Rs. 3,000 earlier was reduced to Rs. 1,300 last year and that it was further reduced to Rs. 800 from this year.

"Minister, the reconnection fee you stated is wrong. I also paid Rs. 3,000 two months ago. I request you to look into this matter," MP MuthukumaranaÂ  said.

Responding to an oral question raised by Parliamentarian W.H.M. Dharmasena, the Minister said the electricity re-connection fee was reduced from Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 1,300 last year and that it was further reduced to Rs. 800 this year.
