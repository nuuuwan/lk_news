MMBL-Pathfinder Group JVâ€™s forex earnings to top $ 425 m

The MMBL-Pathfinder Group joint-venture portfolio of investments are expected to yield nearly $ 425 million in foreign exchange to Sri Lanka in 2024, a significant increase from the $ 250 million it earned in 2023.

In a statement the MMBL-Pathfinder Group said its joint-venture investment portfolio consists of partnerships and strategic alliances with a wide network of globally reputed companies. These operate in niche markets dealing in financial and remittance services, export logistics, petroleum support services, pioneering ventures in tourism and leisure, and technology and innovation-related activities.

Sri Lanka will face new and unforeseen challenges as the international economic environment becomes increasingly complicated and global supply chains fall under continuous stress, especially with emerging geopolitical tensions, multiple wars, and social conflicts. Against this backdrop, MMBL-Pathfinder is committed to a proactive investment strategy that will focus on identifying new sectors that will bring in the maximum possible foreign exchange to the country. MMBL-Pathfinder will continue to support the Pathfinder Foundation, which has emerged as a highly regarded regional strategic studies centre.
