Iranian President invited for official visit to Sri Lanka

Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has been invited for an official visit to Sri Lanka.

Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said on Tuesday during a visit to Sri Lanka that he had received the invitation for President Raisi’s visit to the capital Colombo.

“This visit will be a priority for Iran despite Ayatollah Raisi’s busy schedule,” said the minister.

Amir-Abdollahian arrived in Colombo late on Monday for talks with senior officials of the Sri Lankan government amid Iran’s efforts to boost its ties with the Indian Ocean island nation.
