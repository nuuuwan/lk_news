Three arrested over ‘poisoning’ of two suspects in police custody

The Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) has arrested three suspects for allegedly aiding and abetting the incident of a visitor poisoning two suspects who were detained in a cell at the Aduruppuveediya police station recently.

The apprehensions have been carried out in the Kotahena and Orugodawatta areas this afternoon (15). Police said that the arrested individuals were identified to be aged 22, 24 and 26 and are the residents of Kotahena, Orugodawatta and Colombo 13 areas.

Preliminary police investigations have revealed that the crime has been carried out based on the directive of a notorious criminal who is currently hiding overseas. The Colombo Crimes Division is conducting further investigations regarding the incident.

Two suspects who were held in a cell at the Aduruppuveediya police station had fallen seriously ill after consuming a packet of milk handed to them by a visitor. The suspects in question had been arrested by the police over a recent shooting incident that took place in Jinthupitiya.

Two assailants on a motorcycle had opened fire in Jinthupitiya on January 25, leaving a youth injured. The gunman had escaped the crime scene while bystanders had captured his accomplice. The fleeing gunman was later apprehended in Dambadeniya and was brought to the Aduruppuveediya police station for interrogation. Later, another suspect was also taken into custody for aiding and abetting the shooting.

The apprehended gunman and the third suspect were reportedly held in the same cell at the Aduruppuveediya police station. The girlfriend of the gunman had visited them at the police station on February 07, followed by another visitor, who had given them two buns and a packet of milk.

However, police had recovered CCTV footage where the suspected visitor was seen going into a shop before arriving at the police station. Police revealed that the suspected person is a drug-addict.

Against this backdrop, three police officers – the Acting OIC of Aduruppuveediya police station, a Reserve Officer and the security police officer who was on duty at the police station’s gate at the time, were interdicted in connection with the incident.
