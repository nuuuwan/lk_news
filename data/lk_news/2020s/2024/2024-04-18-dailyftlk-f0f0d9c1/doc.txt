The Company provided tea bagging services to the industry and was the first tea packing factory in Sri Lanka to obtain FSSC certification. He established the tea school, Australian Tea Masters - Ceylon Ltd., under the guidance of Australian Tea Masters (Melbourne). This school for tea tasting, has earned the reputation of being the finest institution for one to begin their career in tea, while assisting many entrepreneurs to get into tea exports.
