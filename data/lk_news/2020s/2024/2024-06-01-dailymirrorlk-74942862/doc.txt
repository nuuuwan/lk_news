Increased tobacco use among schoolchildren: Expert

Health experts have raised concerns about the rising use of tobacco products among schoolchildren in Sri Lanka.

Speaking on World No-Tobacco Day which fell yesterday (31), Dr. Shakya Nanayakkara, Chairman of the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board, highlighted that tobacco products are becoming increasingly common in schools.

Dr. Nanayakkara emphasized that children who become addicted to these products are likely to progress to smoking cigarettes.

He also noted the growing popularity of e-cigarettes globally, cautioning that individuals who develop a nicotine habit through e-cigarettes are at a high risk of transitioning to smoking traditional cigarettes.

Further, he warned that the ingestion of nicotine can lead to adverse effects such as dizziness, vomiting, and general physical discomfort.

As such, Dr. Nanayakkara urged parents and teachers to educate children about the dangers of nicotine and the reasons for its use.
