Tourists’ concerns will be addressed: Sri Lanka state minister

ECONOMYNEXT – The ministry is working to address the many issues faced by tourists in Sri Lanka, State Minister for Tourism Diana Gamage has said.

“Challenges, such as reported ticket price increases at high tourist attractions, are being addressed,” Gamage said at a press briefing at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Friday (12).

The Ministry, unaware of these price hikes, is investigating the matter at the ministry level and denies responsibility for alleged arbitrary actions by some government agencies, Gamage was quoted as saying in a statement by the president’s media division.

“Projects are also in the pipeline to enhance tourist convenience in cultural sites, waterfalls, Ella, Bandarawela, and other tourist areas across the country.”

The state minister said there was a resurgence in the tourism industry, and the ministry was committed to developing the sector further.

“Measures are underway for further tourism development and attracting more tourists to the country this year,” Gamage said, adding that they were in discussions on how to address issues affecting tourists promptly. “Efforts are underway to develop a relief program for tourists facing challenges.”

Gamage predicted that the revitalization of the tourism industry in Sri Lanka will attract 2 million tourists in 2024, generating estimated revenue of US$6 billion. (Colombo/Jan12/2024)
