Knuckles project to establish Soil Spectroscopic Laboratory with international support

The Ministry of Irrigation, funded by the Green Climate Fund and supported by the International Centre for Research and Agroforestry, is implementing the Knuckles project to enhance climate adaptation for subsistence farmers and agro-plantation communities in the Knuckles mountain region.

A key component of the project is the establishment of a Soil Spectroscopic Laboratory within the Department of Export Agriculture. The initiative aims to support farmers in vulnerable river basins, watersheds, and lower valleys by providing advanced soil analysis capabilities.

The International Centre for Research and Agroforestry has agreed to supply the necessary equipment for the laboratory.

In light of this, the Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved a proposal by the Agriculture and Plantation Industries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera to formalise an agreement between the Department of Export Agriculture and the International Centre for Research and Agroforestry for the procurement of these essential tools.

This development is expected to significantly enhance the regionâ€™s agricultural resilience and productivity by enabling precise soil health monitoring and management.
