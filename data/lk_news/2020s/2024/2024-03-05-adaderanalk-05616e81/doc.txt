Planned railway strike temporarily called off

The employees of Sri Lanka Railways have temporarily called off the indefinite strike that was planned to be launched from midnight today (March 05), says the Locomotive Operating Engineersâ€™ Association.

The trade unions of locomotive operating engineers, railway guards, and railway supervisory managers were supposed to join this strike action to urge the government to reverse the Cabinet paper proposing to reduce their salaries.

However, the trade union action was suspended following a discussion held with the authorities this evening.
