US expresses concerns over Human Rights violations during Sri Lanka’s ’Yukthiya’ operation

Colombo, Jan. 10 (Daily Mirror)- The United States has echoed the concerns raised by the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) regarding alleged human rights abuses during the recent 'Yukthiya' Operation conducted by the Sri Lanka Police and the Ministry of Public Security.

US Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Julie J. Chung, emphasized the importance of combating drug trafficking while stressing that law enforcement operations must adhere to the principles of the rule of law and due process.

"Striking this balance is vital for justice and maintaining public trust," she said.

Earlier, the HRCSL expressed deep unease and initiated an immediate inquiry into reports of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment during search operations associated with the 'Yukthiya' Operation.

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka has also expressed serious concerns about the operation, emphasizing the contradiction between reports of widespread injustice and the operation's title, 'Yukthiya,'.
