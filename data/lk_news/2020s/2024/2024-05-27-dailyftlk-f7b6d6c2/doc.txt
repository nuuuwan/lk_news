Customs Department to commence auctions online this week: State Minister

State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya announced that preliminary work to modernise the Customs Department auction process will commence via online this week.

“The initiative aims to allow all interested parties to participate in customs auctions remotely, thereby reducing undue influence and ensuring transparency,” he added.

Siyambalapitiya highlighted that this reform will enable individuals and businesses to bid on auctioned goods from the comfort of their homes. This move is intended to mitigate the influence of various constitutive groups that have previously affected the clearance of goods by customs.

In response to several reported instances of such undue influence, he emphasised the necessity of this overhaul to safeguard the integrity of the auction process. By facilitating remote participation, the Government aims to create a fair and competitive environment for all bidders.

“This week, the Customs Department will initiate the auction process to select service providers capable of implementing this new auction system,” he added.

The State Minister assured that these changes are part of the broader efforts to enhance efficiency and transparency within the Customs Department. “The reform is expected to address longstanding concerns about the fairness and reliability of customs auctions, ultimately fostering greater trust and confidence among stakeholders,” he said.

As the Customs Department prepares to roll out this new system, the auction process will be closely watched by industry participants and observers alike, anticipating a significant improvement in the Customs auction framework.
