SriLankan drops pepper & salt from economy class dish, makes on demand after survey

ECONOMYNEXT – State-owned SriLankan Airlines has dropped pepper and salt packs from its food dishes served for economy class passengers since late last year and made it on demand, witnesses and officials say.

However, the airline has been continuing the supply of the both products to the business class, they say.

Known as the “king” of spices, the island nation’s black pepper has higher piperine content which gives it a superior quality and pungency, compared to the spice produced in other countries.

Earlier, SriLankan Airlines served pepper and salt in small packs branded with the carrier’s logo. However, the airline has decided to drop the salt and pepper from its dishes given only to economy class passengers.

“According to an internal survey, we found that the majority of the passengers travelling on economy class do not use the pepper and salt,” a SriLankan Airlines’ source told EconomyNext when asked for the reason to drop one of the top most export spice.

“As a result we were compelled to throw the unused packets as a waste,” the source said.

“On the other hand, the food dishes that are served in the economy class especially Sri Lankan food contain salt and pepper. So any passenger travelling on economy class is provided salt and pepper if they ask for it. If not, we do not serve them.”

“For passengers travelling on business class, the pepper and salt are served.” (Colombo/June 10/2024)
