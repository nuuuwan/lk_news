Bread, bun sales down: Bakery industry in crisis

Colombo, Feb 28 (Daily Mirror) - Sales of cakes breads and buns in the local market have dropped by around 50% due to the high manufacturing costs, the All Ceylon Bakery Owners' Association (ACBOA) said.

They said the costs of magarin and butter have increased to Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 3,000 per kilo respectively.

"We have still not received the stocks of eggs imported from India and henve we have to buy locally produced eggs at Rs. 60 each. That deals a hard blow to the bakery industry," the association chairman said.

Therefore, the Bakery Owners' Association requests the government to provide concessions while bringing down the prices of the ingredients that the bakery manufactures need before the upcoming Sinhala and Hindu New Year.
