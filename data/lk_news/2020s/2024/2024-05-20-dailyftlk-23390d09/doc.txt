Marking 15 years since the end of Sri Lanka’s three-decade-long conflict, US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung said the United States will remain a steadfast partner to the Sri Lankan people, including those who continue seeking justice, equal rights, and access to opportunities.

Taking to X (formerly Twitter) Chung said her country stands in solidarity with all Sri Lankans, reflecting on the resilience and hope for a united future.

“We reaffirm our commitment to support Sri Lanka’s journey toward a prosperous and inclusive future that embraces its diversity for sustainable peace and progress,” she added.  During a visit to the North over the weekend, Chung also met with the families of the disappeared, former combatants of the terror outfit Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), and persons previously detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).

In a tweet, Chung noted that many Sri Lankan citizens still face ongoing intimidation, though she did not specify by whom. She advocated for the right of all those who lost loved ones to commemorate them.

“All families have the right to memorialise loved ones. Their stories are poignant reminders of the need for a peaceful, durable political solution,” she said.
