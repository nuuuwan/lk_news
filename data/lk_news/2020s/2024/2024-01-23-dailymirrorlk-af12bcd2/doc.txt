Sri Lankan Tamil leaders seek Indian intervention in implementation of 13A

Jan 23 - A group of Sri Lankan Tamil legislators has sought India’s intervention to ensure that Colombo fully implements the New Delhi-mooted 13th Amendment, which provides for the devolution of power to the minority community, a source in Colombo said on Tuesday, 23 January.

The group led by the veteran politician R Sampanthan met India’s new High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Santosh Jha, on Monday, 22 January, said that the source is from the Tamil National Alliance, which represents Sri Lanka’s Tamil minority.

The two-hour-long talks were centred on the 13A, which created the provincial councils system for the island nation’s nine provinces.

The Tamil parties pointed out the need for India’s intervention in the current Sri Lankan political context for the meaningful devolution of power, the source said.

They also highlighted the issue of the Tamil political prisoners and the Tamil land grabbing by the state.
