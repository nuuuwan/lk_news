President Ranil to address the nation

President Ranil Wickremesinghe will address the nation at 8.00 p.m. on Wednesday (26 June), the Government Information Department announced.

It is reported that the President, in his address, is expected to brief the public about the current economic situation in the country and provide an update on the progress made with regard to the restructuring of foreign debt.

Speculation is rife that the President is likely to announce Sri Lanka’s emergence out of bankruptcy during his special statement.

Meanwhile, the national secretary of the United National Party (UNP), Ravi Karunanayake, yesterday (23) indicated that the President’s announcement will provide significant relief to the people of country.
