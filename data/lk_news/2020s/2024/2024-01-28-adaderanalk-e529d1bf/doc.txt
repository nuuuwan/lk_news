President’s Fund announces enhanced scholarship allowance

The President’s Fund has announced the extension and enhancement of the scholarship program for the year 2021/2022, the President’s Media Division (PMD).

This initiative aims to identify and support financially challenged students across all provinces of Sri Lanka, ensuring they have the means to pursue their education without hindrance.

In response to special requests from students, the President has decided to increase the existing monthly allowance of Rs. 5,000.00 to Rs. 6,000.00, effective from February 2024.

This adjustment seeks to provide additional support to scholarship awardees, ensuring their financial well-being and uninterrupted learning until they sit for the G.C.E A/L examination. So far, 10 monthly installments have been paid out.

Furthermore, the President’s Fund is set to award grants to 5,000 students who achieved the highest educational qualifications in the G.C.E. Ordinary Level examination for the year 2022/2023. Each selected student will receive a monthly allowance of Rs. 6,000.00 until the completion of their school education, including the G.C.E. Advanced Level examination.

The President’s Fund is actively engaged in the selection process at the regional level across all provinces and the scholarships are anticipated to be conferred once the selection process concludes.

More information in this regard can be obtained via the official website of the President’s Fund; www.presidentsfund.gov.lk, the PMD noted.
