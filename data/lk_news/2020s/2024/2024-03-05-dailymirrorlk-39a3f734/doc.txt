Refrain from criticizing senior public officers: Speaker tells MPs

Highlighting that he had received complaints from senior public servants that MPs have been making unfair allegations against them, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena today requested the MPs to refrain from criticizing these officers.

"Critical comments made by the MPs on public servants will be expunged from Hansard in the future," he said.

"It is unfair on the part of MPs to criticize public servants as they have no way of responding to the allegations made against them. If the MPs need to question any public official, they can summon such officials to Parliament and do so," he said.
