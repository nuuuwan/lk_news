Colombo Air Show reschedule for next year

The Colombo Air Show and Defence Exhibition (CADE 2024) which was scheduled to be held from May 29 to June 2 at the Galle Face and Colombo Port City, has been postponed to next year, the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) said.

The CADE, organized by the Sri Lanka Air Force, was rescheduled owing to the multiple requests from international partners and defence industry stakeholders, as well as foreign Air Forces to accommodate greater opportunities for their participation and provide a diverse experience to the spectators.

The SLAF said that the event will be held from 26 February to 02 March 2025, aligning with the 74th anniversary of the Sri Lanka Air Force.
