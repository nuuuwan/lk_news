Sri Lanka’s President condemns assassination of Hamas political leader

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s President Ranil Wickremesinghe has expressed his strong condemnation of the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh.

“The killing of the Hamas leader in Tehran this morning is something I strongly condemn. It was wrong and could have prevented a solution to the Gaza conflict,” Wickremesinghe said addressing a meeting with former Provincial Council members.

“This action is likely to escalate problems in the Middle East again, which I do not support. As a nation, we must always uphold the right to life.”

Haniyeh was killed in Iran’s capital Tehran in an air strike at about 02:00 local time, foreign media reports said.

The killing of the 62-year-old ceasefire negotiator has sparked fears of a wider war. (Colombo/Jul31/2024)
