‘Lorenzo Putha 04’ crew repatriated 5 months after capture by pirates

The six Sri Lankan fishermen, who were rescued after their trawler was hijacked by Somali pirates in the Arabian Sea and were subsequently detained at Victoria Port in Seychelles, have been repatriated to the island yesterday (23) after 5 months.

The six crew members of the multi-day fishing trawler arrived at the Dikovita fisheries harbor on Sunday.

On January 27, the Sri Lankan multi-day fishing trawler “Lorenzo Putha - 4” with 6 crew members aboard was hijacked by Somali pirates and were later rescued by the Seychelles Defence Forces.

However, their repatriation to the island was delayed for 5 months due to required paperwork and legal proceedings.

Five months after the judicial process conducted by the Seychelles government regarding the pirates, the multi-day vessel “Lorenzo Putha - 4” and the 6 fishermen arrived safely in the island yesterday.
