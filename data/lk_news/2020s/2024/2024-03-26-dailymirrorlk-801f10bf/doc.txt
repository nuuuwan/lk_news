Cabinet Paper to reduce electricity charges for Northern Province farmers

Colombo, March 26 (Daily Mirror) - A Cabinet Paper will be submitted to reduce the electricity charges of farmers in the Northern Province who use electricity for agricultural purposes, Agriculture and Plantation Industries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.

He said the decision was taken in consideration of the commitment of the people of the Northern Province to carry out all the work with great effort in the agricultural activities.

The Minister said that the President advised that most of the money allocated to the Ministries should be allocated to the people of the Northern and Eastrn Provinces when implementing development activities.

The people in the Northern Province suffered from the war that lasted for 30 years. But they didn't give up farming, even in the midst of those troubles. Therefore, the farmers of the Northern Province have requested some relief when they use electricity for their agricultural activities. Accordingly, steps are being taken to present a Cabinet Paper for some relief for the electricity charges used for agricultural purposes, the Minister said.
