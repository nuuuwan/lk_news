Weather advisory issued for heavy rains

The Meteorology Department has issued an advisory for heavy rainfall, valid for the next 24 hours, for the Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces and in Galle and Matara districts.

It states that the prevailing showery condition are expected to continue in the southwestern part of the island due to the low-level atmospheric disturbance in the vicinity of Sri Lanka.

Heavy showers above 100 mm are likely at some places in Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces and in Galle and Matara districts, the advisory warned.

The general public is therefore kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
