ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s President Anura Dissanayake continued campaigning for his National People’s Power party in the upcoming general election, amidst the US, UK, Australian and Russian diplomatic missions issuing travel warnings to citizens visiting Arugam Bay.

“A heartfelt gratitude to the thousands who attended the inaugural victorious public rally series (‘Building the Nation Together—We are for Malimawa!’) held this morning (23) in Trincomalee. Your unwavering support is truly appreciated,” Dissanayake said on X (twitter).

Dissanayake opted to skip the globally significant BRICS forum in Russia despite a personal invitation from Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the presence of Indian and Chinese leaders at the forum.

Dissanayake is also skipping the 2024 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Samoa, and instead sending a group of representatives comprising officers of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Sri Lanka High Commission in London. (Colombo/Oct23/2024)
