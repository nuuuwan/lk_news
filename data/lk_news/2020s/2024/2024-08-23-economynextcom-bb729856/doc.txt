Sri Lanka chamber hosts policy czar debate ahead of Presidential polls

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Ceylon Chamber of Commerce said a debate among policy experts nominated by key presidential candidates will be held on August 29, at the BMICH at 0900 am.

State Minister Shehan Semasinghe will represent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Harsha De Silva Sajith Premadasa, Harshana Suriyapperuma Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and Ranjith Bandara Namal Rajapakse.

The debate will be moderated by Chairman of the Ceylon Chamber Duminda Hulangamuwa and Board Member Kasturi Chellaraja.

“This debate comes at a crucial time when the nation faces unparalleled economic challenges, and the need for a stable and sustainable economy has never been more urgent,” the Ceylon Chamber said.

“There is a growing call for clarity on the candidates’ economic strategies across the country, from business leaders and professionals to academics and civil society.

“Voters seek to understand not only who they are casting their votes for, but also the policies and plans they are endorsing.”

The Ceylon Chamber has for decades been at the forefront of advocacy, engaging with policymakers at the highest levels to drive critical economic reforms.

In the lead-up to the recent economic crisis, the Ceylon Chamber was actively engaging with political parties, urging reforms to avert disaster.

Later the Chamber said it collaborated with policymakers to implement necessary reforms related to taxation, independence of the Central Bank, energy reforms, digital ID, and improving market access through Free Trade Agreements. (Colombo/Aug23/2024)
