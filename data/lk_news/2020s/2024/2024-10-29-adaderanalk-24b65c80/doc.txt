Train services on coastal line delayed

The train services on the coastal line have been delayed due to a train breaking down at Payagala owing to a technical failure, the Department of Railways said.

It is reported that the relevant train is being brought to Colombo Fort by using another train engine.

As a result, the train operating from Galle to Colombo along the coastal line will be delayed, the Department of Railways said.
