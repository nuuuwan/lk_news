Cabinet nod to gazette draft bills to amend Anti-Dumping and Safeguard Measures

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved publishing of draft bills to amend the Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties Act, No. 2 of 2018 and the Safeguard Measures Act, No. 3 of 2018, in the Government gazette and tabled the same to Parliament for approval.

Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena speaking at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting yesterday asserted that the draft bills prepared by the Legal Draftsman received clearance from the Attorney General.

The move follows the recognition of the need for corresponding amendments to these Acts during the preparation of the Economic Transformation draft bill.

“The proposed amendments aim to enhance the effectiveness and applicability of the current legislation,” he said, adding that amendments are expected to strengthen Sri Lanka’s trade defence mechanisms, ensuring better protection against unfair trade practices and promoting fair competition in the market.

The proposal to this effect submitted by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as the Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies Minister was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
