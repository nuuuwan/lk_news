SLPP has to find a better candidate than RW - Prasanna

Colombo, March 01, (Daily Mirror) -Â  Indicating the problem faced by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) in facing the forthcoming Presidential election, Minister Prasanna Ranatunga told yesterday that his party, the SLPP would have to find a better candidate than President Ranil Wickremesnghe if it wants to field a candidate of its own.

He said that former minister Basil Rajapaksa will not contest while time is not ripe for Namal Rajapaksa to contest.

"I will support Basil if he contests for the presidency, but he will not contest" he stated.

Ranatunga, who is highly supportive of President Wickremesinghe's recent decisions, warned that he will have to decide on his SLPP membership if the party decides to field another candidate.

He expressed these views at a party meeting held in his hometown, Udugampola in Gampaha District.
