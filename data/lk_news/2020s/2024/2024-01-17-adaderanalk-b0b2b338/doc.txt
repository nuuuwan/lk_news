Police fire tear gas and water cannons at IUSF protest

Police have fired tear gas and water cannons at protesting university students in Wijerama a short while ago.

Accordingly, police fired tear gas and water cannons in attempts to disperse an Inter-University Students’ Federation (IUSF) protest march staged in the Wijerama area, Ada Derana learns.

Earlier today (17 Jan.), the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court issued an order barring the IUSF from inconveniencing the members of the public during their protest march.

As per the court order, university students are barred from entering Deans Road, Kularatna Mawatha, T.B. Jayah Mawatha and several other roads in Colombo and marching in protest while obstructing motorists and pedestrians.
