Health trade unions strike in selected hospitals

The Health Trade Union Alliance has launched a token strike over the wage issue today (April 01).

The Co-convener of the alliance Chanaka Dharmawickrema stated that the strike will be carried out in a few selected hospitals from 6.30 a.m. today.

Meanwhile, they have decided to launch an indefinite island-wide strike on Tuesday (02), if no solutions are received to their grievances.

“We had decided to carry out a 4-hour strike in all hospitals island-wide, but today the President’s office has called us for a discussion. Therefore, we decided to limit the planned strike to 05 hospitals such as Kandy, Anuradhapura, Ratnapura, Kurunegala and Badulla. If no solution is received today, we will launch a nationwide strike tomorrow”, he added.
