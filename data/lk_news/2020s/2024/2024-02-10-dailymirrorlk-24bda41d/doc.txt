SLC to facilitate training for Ugandan cricket team, to play seven T20s

Colombo, Feb 10 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) will facilitate the Uganda national cricket team for a 14-day training camp.

The Ugandan team, who last year qualified for the T20 World Cup, arrived in the island today.

"The facilitation will include the allocation of an international ground (GICS, Galle), the allocation of a team from the High Performance Center Development Squads to play seven T20 games, and providing match-related logistics, such as umpires, scorers, match meals, medical support, and other relevant assistance at the ground," SLC said in a media statement.

"Sri Lanka Cricket's facilitation comes as a goodwill gesture for an Associate member of the International Cricket Council. The Uganda national team was facilitated following a request made by the Ugandan Cricket Association from the Speaker of Sri Lanka Parliament, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana, when the honorable speaker attended the 27th Conference of Speakers and Presiding Officers of the Commonwealth held in Uganda from January 3 to 6, 2024."
