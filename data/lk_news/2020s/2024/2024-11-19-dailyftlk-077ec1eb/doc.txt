New era for EO Sri Lanka as 2024/2025 Board takes office

The Entrepreneurs’ Organisation (EO) Sri Lanka recently ushered in a new chapter of leadership with the handover of the 2024-2025 Board.

Outgoing President Haresh de Soysa, Director of Trade Promoters Ltd., passed the mantle of leadership to the newly appointed President, Naishadh Udeshi, Director of Chinese Dragon Café. This dynamic transition marks an exciting period of renewed focus and fresh initiatives for Sri Lanka’s entrepreneurial community.

Since its establishment in 2017, EO Sri Lanka has grown steadily, overcoming global challenges such as the pandemic and economic uncertainty. With over 60 active members today, the chapter stands as a vibrant hub for some of the nation’s leading entrepreneurs. On the global front, EO boasts more than 19,000 members spread across 222 chapters in over 87 countries, making it one of the largest networks of business owners in the world.

EO’s mission is clear: to unlock the full potential of entrepreneurs by fostering meaningful connections, sharing experiences, and providing opportunities for collaborative learning. Founded in 1987, the organisation is guided by its core values—trust and respect, a thirst for learning, bold thinking, and mutual growth. EO Sri Lanka’s board embodies these values as it embarks on a new journey under Udeshi’s leadership, with a renewed commitment to further strengthening the entrepreneurial ecosystem.

Over the past year, EO Sri Lanka has curated a range of enriching experiences, building its reputation as a premier platform for entrepreneurial development. Among the standout events was a rare architectural tour of the iconic Sri Lankan Parliament, designed by the legendary Geoffrey Bawa. Members explored the intricacies of the architecture and participated in an insightful discussion led by the Speaker of Parliament on governance, leadership, and the fascinating intersection of architecture and politics.

In addition, the chapter hosted a masterclass on storytelling, equipping members with the skills to craft powerful narratives—a tool essential for business success. These events, along with numerous workshops, networking opportunities, and forums, have cemented EO Sri Lanka as a space where business minds come together to grow personally and professionally.

With a forward-thinking board at the helm, EO Sri Lanka is poised to continue its upward trajectory. President Naishadh Udeshi expressed enthusiasm for the journey ahead, focusing on expanding membership, enhancing member engagement, and fostering collaboration across industries. “We aim to be a transformative force, helping entrepreneurs reach new heights while strengthening the bonds within our community,” Udeshi remarked at the handover ceremony.
