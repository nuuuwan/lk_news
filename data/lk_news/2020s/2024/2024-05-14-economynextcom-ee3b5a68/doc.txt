Sri Lanka unlikely to hold O/L English, Science exams again despite complaints: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is unlikely to repeat English and Science exams at the ongoing G.C.E ordinary level (O/L) exams, Education Minister Susil Premajayantha said, amid reports of paper leakage and including some questions out of the syllabus.

Reports have emerged of English paper being leaked in social media and including questions in Science paper outside the syllabus.

Premajayantha said the English paper has been leaked only one hour after the English exam was started.

“So there is no way students had access to that. By the time it was leaked, students were doing the exams,” he told reporters at a media briefing in Colombo.

“For science paper, there will be grace marks for those who are affected by the questions which are claimed to have caused injustice to the students.”

He said the complaint on science paper will be considered when the marking scheme is prepared through routine sample marking to ensure no injustice will be caused to the students.

“So the message is we do not have to repeat the exams,” the Minister told separately.

Ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna MP Madhura Withanage last week claimed that Science question paper for the ongoing G.C.E O/L examination has been prepared beyond the provisioning plan.

Withanage highlighted that portions of three Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and three essay-type questions in this year’s O/L Science paper has been prepared outside the provisioning plan. (Colombo/May 14/2028)
