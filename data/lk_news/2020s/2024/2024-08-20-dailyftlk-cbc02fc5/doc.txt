PAFFREL raises concerns over alleged election law violations by Govt.

States appointments represent violation of election laws, misuse of public funds

Reveals vehicles from 5 Ministries used for election campaigning, 14 transfers within Govt. institutions

Calls for stricter adherence to legal guidelines to ensure fair electoral process

The People’s Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) has expressed serious concerns regarding the Government’s alleged violations of election laws.

The organisation has formally informed the Election Commission about these issues, focusing particularly on the recent appointment of two Presidential advisors by President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Speaking to the media, PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi stated that these appointments represent a clear violation of election laws and constitute a misuse of public funds.

“The two individuals appointed as Presidential advisors are actively involved in the President’s election campaign on a daily basis,” he said, arguing that it is a tactic to promote a candidate – an act forbidden under election regulations.

Hettiarachchi also highlighted that the benefits provided to these advisors, including vehicles, are an inappropriate use of public resources.

In addition to these concerns, Hettiarachchi revealed that vehicles from five Government ministries have been used for election campaigning and 14 transfers within Government institutions have taken place, both actions that he believes violate election laws.

He raised questions about the integrity of the electoral process.

“These types of actions cannot be condoned ahead of a Presidential election,” Hettiarachchi added, calling for stricter adherence to legal guidelines to ensure a fair electoral process.
