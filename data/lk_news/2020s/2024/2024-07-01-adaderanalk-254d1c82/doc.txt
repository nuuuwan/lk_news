NPP will hand over power to modern youth from the corrupted elite – AKD

Leader of the National People’s Power (NPP) Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that under the leadership of his party, the youth will be provided with new economic opportunities for small and medium businesses.

Addressing Anuradhapura district’s youth conference of NPP held in Kekirawa, he further stated that his party will take over the power from the corrupted elite and hand it over to the modern youth generation.

“We will create a mania of small and medium-scale businesses. Instead of getting a government job, the youth thinks how to become an entrepreneur. But, they don’t have the first essential thing to become an entrepreneur, which is the capital”, Dissanayake said.

“Under the leadership of National People’s Power, we will build a new development bank, which will provide Initial capital without collateral. We will create new economic opportunities for the youth.”

“For the longest time, the political authority in our country destructed the youth’s future”, he alleged.

“We will clearly tell you what we will do. We will overtake the power of the corrupt elite and we will not hand over it to our children. We are ready to hand over the power to the modern youth generation who’s in front of us”, said the NPP leader.
