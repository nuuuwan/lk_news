Empowering Eastern Sri Lanka: Strengthening information rights for citizenry

In a concerted effort to bolster the capacity of state officials in safeguarding the information rights of citizens, a pioneering initiative is set to unfold across the districts of Trincomalee, Batticaloa, and Ampara.

The project, titled “Innovative Space for Promoting Freedom of Expression and Information Rights,” is generously funded by the Commonwealth Foundation and implemented by the Sri Lanka Development Journalist Forum (SDJF).

With a focused agenda on enhancing the capabilities of information officers, a cohort of 120 participants convened for a day workshop, facilitated by Chief Editor of Vidiyal and prominent journalist cum Right to Information (RTI) activist Rifthi Ali the workshops engaged attendees through immersive methodologies such as case studies, demonstrations, and interactive dialogues.

The overarching goal of this initiative is to empower state officials to effectively uphold the fundamental rights of citizens, particularly in the realm of information access and freedom of expression. By equipping information officers with practical tools and knowledge, the project seeks to foster a culture of transparency, accountability, and democratic governance within Eastern Sri Lanka.

“This project represents a critical step towards nurturing an informed and engaged citizenry,” remarked Attorney-at-law and SDJF Program Director Azad Mustaffa providing guidance to the initiative. “By strengthening the information rights infrastructure, we aim to cultivate an environment where citizens can actively participate in decision-making processes and hold authorities accountable,” he added.

The workshops, characterised by their dynamic and participatory nature, are anticipated to serve as catalysts for positive change within the Eastern Sri Lankan communities. Through collaborative efforts between stakeholders, including the Commonwealth Foundation, the Sri Lanka Development Journalist Forum, and esteemed facilitators, the project endeavours to lay a robust foundation for a more transparent and inclusive society.
