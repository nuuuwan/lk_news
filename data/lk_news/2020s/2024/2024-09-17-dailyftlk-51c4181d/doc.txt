J’pura Students’ Union files complaint with ECSL against Sajith

Says the SJB Presidential candidate is disseminating false information through election platforms in relation to a clash which occurred recently

Claims he is misinterpreting it as an inter-part clash at the University for political gain

Stresses Premadasa’s statements have unfairly tarnished students and the university

Calls on the ECSL to investigate and take immediate action against Premadasa

The General Students’ Union of Sri Jayewardenepura University has lodged a formal complaint with the Election Commission, accusing Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Presidential candidate Sajith Premadasa and his representatives of disseminating false information through election platforms.

The complaint comes in the wake of unrest at the university, which led to its temporary closure on 12 September.

The unrest reportedly arose from certain rumours circulating among students, and the university administration’s decision to shut down was intended to maintain order. However, the General Students’ Union claims that Premadasa and his team are misinterpreting the incident for political gain, presenting it as a violent clash between two student factions aligned with different political parties.

According to the union, Premadasa’s campaign has falsely portrayed the university as having become a “river of blood” due to these alleged conflicts, a claim they strongly deny. The General Students’ Union asserts that these misleading statements have unfairly tarnished the reputation of Sri Jayewardenepura University and its students.

The union has called on the Election Commission to investigate the matter and take immediate action to prevent further spread of false information during the campaign period.
