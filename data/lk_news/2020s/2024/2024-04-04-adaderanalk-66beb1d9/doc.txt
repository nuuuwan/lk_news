The Commission to Investigation Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) has filed a case with the Colombo High Court against the former Chairman and the former Managing Director of ‘Laksala’, Sri Lanka’s state-owned handicraft marketing organization, over alleged corruption charges.

The Bribery Commission said it has carried out investigations related to a complaint received alleging that the former Chairman and the former Managing Director of ‘Laksala’ have committed corruption offences by awarding the contract for constructing a ‘Laksala’ outlet at the National Museum site, to an unqualified contractor by overriding the decisions of the Board of Directors of the Sri Lanka Handicrafts Board and thereby causing undue losses to the government.

Following thorough investigation into the complaint, a case has been filed with the Colombo High Court by the Bribery Commission against the former Chairman and the former Managing Director of ‘Laksala’ on Thursday (04).
