Ramadan fasting in Sri Lanka to commence tomorrow

Muslims in Sri Lanka will begin the month of Ramadan fasting from dawn on Tuesday (12 March) as the new crescent moon has been sighted, according to the Colombo Grand Mosque.

Muslims all over the world will observe a month of fasting and prayers during Ramadan to commemorate the time when the Quran was revealed to Prophet Mohammed on the night of “Laylat Al Qadr”.

Fasting during Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, is considered to be one of the Five Pillars of Islam.
