Mujibur sworn in as National List MP

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) member, Mujibur Rahman was sworn in yesterday as a National List Member of Parliament before Speaker of House Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena.

The SJB had decided to nominate former MP Rahman to fill the National List MP position left vacant by the disqualification of former State Minister Diana Gamage from holding a Parliamentary seat.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday declared that Gamage is not legally qualified to hold a Parliamentary seat.

The Secretary-General of Parliament informed the Election Commission that a Parliamentary seat in the Ninth Parliament has become vacant from 8 May 2024, due to the cancellation of Parliamentary seat of Gamage.

Accordingly, delivering its verdict, the three-judge Supreme Court bench decided that Gamage is not eligible to hold the position of Member of Parliament as she holds dual citizenship. This was formally conveyed to the Chairman of the Election Commission in writing, pursuant to Section 64(1) of Parliamentary Elections Act No.01 of 1981.

In January 2023, SJB MP Rahman decided to step down as a MP to vie for the post of Mayor of Colombo in the now-postponed 2023 Local Government election.

Meanwhile, a Gazette notification was issued on Thursday evening stating that Rahman has been nominated by the SJB to fill the vacancy in Parliament created by the disqualification of Diana Gamage as Member of Parliament by a Supreme Court verdict.
