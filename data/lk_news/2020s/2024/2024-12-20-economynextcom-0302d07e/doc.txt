Sri Lanka cannot decide on Adani wind project until court decision: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka cannot make a final decision on a proposed wind power plant by India’s Adani group as there was an ongoing court case, Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath said.

“That case is before courts,” Herath told reporters Friday. “The court has not given a decision yet.”

Sri Lanka cannot make a final decision until the court decision comes, he said.

Activists petitioned courts saying the wind plant caused environmental harm.

The wind farm in Mannar in particular had come under fire after a tender to purchase power was decided without competitive bidding was sharply higher than prices by competitive bidding for the same area.

Sri Lanka however is going ahead with an Adani-backed container terminal in the Port of Colombo. Tax breaks for the projects were tabled in parliament. (Colombo/Dec20/2024)
