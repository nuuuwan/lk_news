Unlocking the power of migration towards Sustainable Development in Sri Lanka

With the Government of Sri Lanka adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015 and the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM) in 2018, the need for monitoring and assessing the contribution of migration is stronger than ever. Harnessing the synergy between the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the GCM is crucial to propel the country forward. By aligning the SDGs and the GCM, Sri Lanka can create a holistic approach to sustainable development that acknowledges the multifaceted role of migration.

The Sustainable Development Council (SDC) and International Organization for Migration (IOM) successfully wrapped up a Sensitization Workshop on the Correlation between Migration and the SDGs on 31st July. The workshop primarily focused on ways and means to address gaps in migration-related data in order to develop a national framework for monitoring and assessing the contribution of migration towards the SDGs.

Delivering the welcome and inaugural address, the Director General of SDC, Ms. Chamindry Saparamadu mentioned that as migration is a powerful force that drives development and transformation across societies where skills, innovation, and cultural diversity is brought upon by migrant population enriching communities as a whole, the workshop is an opportunity to delve into how migration can be harnessed to achieve the SDGs. She further committed to working with the IOM and other relevant agencies to advance the migration-SDGs agenda in Sri Lanka.

In her opening remarks, Dr. Simeonette De Asis, Deputy Chief of Mission, IOM Sri Lanka and the Maldives stated ‘IOM in coordination with the SDC, hosted this workshop to bring together government and non-governmental stakeholders to deepen their understanding on the vital nexus between migration and the SDGs. Enhancing knowledge in this area will enable us to harness the potential of migration to ensure that no migrant is left behind. We are thankful for the SDC for their unwavering support and dedication to foster a collaborative approach towards achieving the SDGs’.

IOM consultant Dr. Bilesha Weeraratne (Head of Migration and Urbanization Policy Research of the Institute of Policy Studies) presented a comprehensive review on Migration and SDGs while the Assistant Director of SDC, Ms. Sheron Hewawaduge spoke of the current availability of migration-related data in Sri Lanka.

The participants engaged in an interactive discussion on the relevance of SDG targets to migration and development context in Sri Lanka as well as in mapping of institutions working towards those goals.

The workshop is an initial step in the process of developing a comprehensive national framework to monitor and assess the contribution of migration towards the SDGs. The framework will serve as a vital tool for policymakers and researchers to maximize the benefits of migration for sustainable development in Sri Lanka.

The workshop was attended by senior representatives from government institutions (Ministry of Labour and Foreign Employment, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Education , Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Public Administration Home Affairs, Provincial Council and Local Government, National Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force, Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment , Department of Census & Statistics, Office for Overseas Sri Lanka Affairs, Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission etc.), international agencies (International Labour Organization, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation etc.) and non-government agencies ( Center for Human Rights and Development, Lawyers beyond borders – Sri Lanka Chapter, Caritas Sedec, SYLCAN Trust, Association for Licensed Foreign Employment Agents, Save the Children, Action Network for Migrant Workers etc. ) working in migration-related areas.
