Sri Lanka earmarks Rs1bn for cricket development

ECONOMYNEXT – Preventing politicians from assuming high positions in sports clubs could contribute to a healthier sporting environment, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said, pledging one billion rupees for cricket development.

“It is important to maintain a clear distinction between politics and sports,” Wickremesinghe said advocating for the exclusion of politicians from high-ranking positions within sports clubs.

This did not signify a disengagement from sports, he said. “The government has earmarked one billion rupees for cricket development this year, with plans for additional funding in the following year,” Wickremesinghe was speaking at the 125th anniversary celebration of the Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC) at the Shangri-La Hotel Colombo.

This investment will be managed by a trust overseen by Sidath Wettamuni. The funds will be utilized to enhance cricket programs in rural schools, organize cricket matches and foster the growth of cricket at the grassroots level.

Wickremesinghe said it was important to expand cricket programs in 1,000-1,500 schools to cultivate a talent pool from which the national team can be selected.

A proposal has also been put to the Cabinet to provide the land belonging to the Sinhala Sports Club on a 99-year lease basis. (Colombo/Mar30/2024)
