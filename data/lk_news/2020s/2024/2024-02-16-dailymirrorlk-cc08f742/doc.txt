Mawanella, Feb 16 (Daily Mirror) - Thirty individuals, including 27 students attending an extracurricular boxing class in Mawanella, were attacked by wasps, a senior official at the Hospital said.

The attack occurred near an abandoned ten-storey building known for housing multiple wasps' nests, a recurring hazard that has plagued the vicinity for some time.
