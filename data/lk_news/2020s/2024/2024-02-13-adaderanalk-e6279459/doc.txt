Pilot project underway to introduce AI courses to education system

The Cabinet of Ministers has granted approval to implement a pilot project to introduce courses on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the school curriculum starting from Grade 08, the Department of Government Information (DGI) said.

Earlier, on 02 October 2023, the Cabinet of Ministers decided that it is appropriate to introduce courses related to the AI into the education system in accordance with the recommendations made by the task force appointed for the formation of a national strategy and plan related to artificial intelligence.

As part of the relevant strategic plan, a pilot project has been designed to introduce artificial intelligence courses to general education.

Thus, the Cabinet approval has been granted for the joint resolution presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Minister of Technology, together with the Minister of Education, to implement the said pilot project with the support of Microsoft.

The DGI stated that the pilot project will be implemented after revising the current international syllabus implemented by Microsoft, based on the recommendations of the National Institute of Education of Sri Lanka. The project will be initiated from Grade 08 of the schools where necessary fundamental human resources are available.

Furthermore, it has been decided to digitalise the schools selected to carry out the pilot project, under the facilities provided by Microsoft.

Additionally, 100 Information and Communication Technology (ICT) teachers are to be trained by the trainers of Microsoft in order to carry out the project in Sri Lanka.
