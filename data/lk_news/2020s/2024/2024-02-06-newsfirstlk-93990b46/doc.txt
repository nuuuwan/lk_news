Nurses in Civilian Clothes: Union Action Continues for Allowances

COLOMBO (News 1st); Members of the Public Service United Nurses Union (PSUNU) continued their trade union action today (6), wearing civilian clothes instead of their official uniforms to protest several demands, including a uniform allowance and salary increase.

The union action began on February 5th, with nurses across the country reporting for duty in civilian attire.

PSUNU demands include the allocation of a dedicated uniform allowance and a Rs. 20,000 increase in their existing allowance.

News 1st correspondents reported continued union activity at hospitals in Kurunegala, Anuradhapura, and Karapitiya.

While patient care has not been directly disrupted, concerns remain about the potential impact of prolonged action on healthcare services.

In a positive development, the Health Service Trade Union Alliance is scheduled to meet with the Secretary of the Finance Ministry this afternoon at the Ministry of Finance.

Health Service Trade Union Alliance convenor Ravi Kumudesh confirmed that discussions will focus on key issues like salaries and allowances for healthcare workers, potentially paving the way for a resolution to the current impasse.
