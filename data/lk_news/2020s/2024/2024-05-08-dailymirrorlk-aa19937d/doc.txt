No airline in the world making profits: Minister

Parliament, May 08 (Daily Mirror)- No airline in the world is making any profits and it is a situation inherent to all airlines, Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said today.

He told Parliament that airlines even in rich countries such as Air India, BOAC and Swiss Airlines were not profit making and some were sold out.

Responding to a question by SJB MP Hesha Vithanage, the Minister said Air India was sold out to Tata due to losses and added that Emirates was provided some USD 2 to 3 billion by the government every year.

He said a small country like Sri Lanka is not in a position to maintain an airline in that manner.

"We have no funds to purchase aircraft. We cannot invest a large capital. We take flights on lease. We need to join with a group which can bring in a large capital so as to continue the airline to ensure the job security of 6,000 employees," he said.

MP Vithanage said that 791 employees were recruited to SriLankan Airlines in 2023 which is the largest recruitment during the last 10 years while it was incurring a loss of Rs. 609 billion by the end of 2023.

The Minister said recruitment was made as some 474 employees had resigned last year.
