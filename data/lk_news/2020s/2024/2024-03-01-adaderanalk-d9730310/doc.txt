Brother-in-law of Zahran arrested

Police have arrested a person who is identified as the brother-in-law of Zahran Hashim during a sudden raid carried out in the Kattankudy area.

The raid was carried out based on a tip-off received by the police about an unlawful assembly. At the time, a group of people have been playing card games at the scene.

The arrested individual named Niyaz was subsequently found to be the husband of Zahran’s sister, who was suspected to be involved in the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks, as per police.

Zahran Hashim was the ringleader of the breakaway members of the hardline Islamist group National Thowheed Jama’ath (NTJ), accused of carrying out coordinated suicide bombings on April 21, 2019 which killed more than 350 people.
