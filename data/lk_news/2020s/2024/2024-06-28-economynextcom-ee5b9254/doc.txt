Sri Lanka 165MW renewable tenders Rs15+, Mannar wind award in two weeks: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Mannar 50 Mega Watt wind power plant and 165MW of renewable plants and would be awarded to the “lowest & successful” bidder, Minister of Energy Kanchana Wijesekera said.

“The process for approvals has also been expedited, and MOPE hopes to conclude the awarding to lowest & successful bidder of Mannar 50 Mw wind tender & 165 Mw tenders in the next two weeks,” Minister Wijesekera said in an x.com post.

The tenders of the 50MW wind plant came in at 4.88 US cents by Windforce Plc, 4.88 cents by Vidulanka and  5.90 cents by Lakdhanavi, he said.

The prices are sharply lower than the India’s Adani non-competitive negotiated price of 8.26 US cents.

The 165MW small renewable tender has responses ranging from 15 rupees to 29 rupees and is being evaluated by the Ceylon Electricity Board, he said.

The Mannar wind plant at 4.88 cents is about 14.90 rupees at an exchange rate of 305 to the US dollar.

The Adani plant negotiated without tender works out to about 25.10 rupees a unit at 305 rupees to the US dollar. (Colombo/June27/2024)
