Election Commission set to discuss PC and LG polls

The Election Commission is scheduled to reconvene a meeting on November 27 to deliberate on matters concerning the Local Government and Provincial Council elections.

Accordingly, it will be the commission’s first meeting since the conclusion of the parliamentary election.

A court order pertaining to the holding of the Local Government Election has already been issued, and the commission’s primary focus during the meeting will be to address matters related to this directive.

It has been further reported that the financial allocations required for both the Local Government and Provincial Council elections will be incorporated into the Vote on Account, scheduled to be presented to the Parliament in December.

Although it has been decided to allocate funds for these elections, a final decision regarding the dates of the polls has not yet been determined. This matter is expected to be a key agenda item during the forthcoming meeting.

Meanwhile, the Election Commission has informed political parties that are yet to submit their National List MP nominees to do so without further delay.

As of yesterday (17), the commission has already gazetted the National List MP nominees submitted by several political parties.
