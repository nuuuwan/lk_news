Fifth suspect arrested over murder of Buddhist monk at temple

Another suspect has been apprehended in connection with the murder of a Buddhist monk at a temple in the Malwathuhiripitiya area last month.

The Western/North Crimes Division officers have also recovered a hand grenade and a pistol from the possession of the arrestee.

A group of four assailants, who had arrived in a car, shot dead a Buddhist monk inside a temple in the Malwathuhiripitiya area of Gampaha in the early hours of January 23.

The 45-year-old Buddhist monk, Ven. Kalapaluwawe Dhammarathana Thero, who sustained critical injuries in the incident, had been rushed to the Gampaha Hospital. But he later succumbed to injuries while receiving treatment.

Earlier this week, the investigating officers managed to arrest four other suspects who were allegedly complicit in the murder.

The T-56 rifle supposedly used by the perpetrators had been recovered from the possession of the fourth suspect, in addition to a live grenade, pistol, 3 magazines, 15 grams of heroin, 19 rounds of live ammunition, a motorcycle with a fake registration plate, remote switch of the car used in the shooting and a mobile phone.

Preliminary investigations had revealed that the 30-year-old was directly involved in multiple criminal activities and drug syndicates run by two members of organized criminal gangs, currently living abroad.
