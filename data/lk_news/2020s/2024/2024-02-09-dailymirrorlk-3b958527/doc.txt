Osu Sala closed...

The Rajya Osu Sala (SPC) at Union Place, Colombo, was closed today, with the employees demanding the government to pay the cost of living allowance approved by the 2024 budget. A board was hung at the gate of the Osu Sala, appologising to the consumers for their inconvenience. Pix by Nimalsiri Edirisinghe
