Several trains cancelled due to strike

Train operations have been disrupted owing to the trade union action launched by the Railway Station Masters.

The Railway Department said that several trains have been cancelled while limited trains are in operation due to the strike.

However, steps have been taken to operate two trains each from Colombo Fort to Negombo and Veyangoda, two trains from Polgahawela to Fort, three trains from Galle to Fort and one train from Aluthgama to Fort, the department said.

Meanwhile, it is reported that Railway Controllers have decided to support the trade union action initiated by Station masters.

The Sri Lanka Railways Station Masters’ Union had decided to launch a strike action from midnight yesterday (09) based on several demands including promotions.

As a result, several trains including the night mail trains to and from Colombo Fort and Badulla, to and from Trincomalee, to and from Batticaloa and night mail train to Rambukkana were cancelled, the department said.

However, the Secretary of the Ministry of Transport Ranjith Rubasinghe emphasised that since public transport including railway services have been declared as essential services, the strike launched by the Station Masters’ Union is illegal.

Furthermore, he stated that strict disciplinary action would be taken against those who are not reporting for duty.

Rubasinghe also expressed that if any disruption occurs to the operation of office trains today (10) due to the strike situation, necessary steps have been taken to deploy more Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) buses.

He highlighted that free transportation will be provided on SLTB buses for the passengers who have obtained train season tickets.
