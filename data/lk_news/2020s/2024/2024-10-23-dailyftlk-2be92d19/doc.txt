President skips 2024 CHOGM amid Parliamentary Elections

Amidst the upcoming General Elections, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake will not attend the 2024 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) to be held in Samoa from 24 to 26 October.

“Neither the President nor myself as the Foreign Minister are participating at this year’s CHOGM,” Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Vijitha Herath said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

He said only a group of representatives comprising the senior officers of the Foreign Affairs Ministry and Sri Lanka High Commission in London will participate at this year’s events representing Sri Lanka.
