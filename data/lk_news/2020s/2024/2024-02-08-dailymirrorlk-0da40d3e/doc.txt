Sapporo Snow Festival 2024

The Sapporo Snow Festival - an annual celebration now in its 74th year - is in full swing.

Set across three main venues in Sapporo city on the island of Hokkaido - Ōdōri Park, Susukino, and Tsudome - the snowy free-entry spectacle is the most popular winter event in Japan, attracting two million visitors each year.

In total, 196 awe-inspiring snow and ice sculptures are on display - from fairy-tale castles to galloping thoroughbred horses, and from grinning dinosaurs to manga heroes. (Daily Mail)
