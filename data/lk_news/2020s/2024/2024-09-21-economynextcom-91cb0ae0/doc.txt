Sri Lanka EC validates pencil-marked ballot paper

ECONOMYNEXT – Ballot papers marked with pencil will be valid and accepted in Sri Lanka’s Presidential poll, the Election Commission (EC) said after complaints over some polling stations using pencils instead of carbon-pen, the EC said in a statement on Saturday.

“Carbon pens have been provided to all polling stations to mark ballot papers. However, the Election Commission has received complaints of pencils being used to mark ballot papers in some polling stations as in the past,” the EC said in a statement issued around 1500 hours.

“With this regard, the Commission has already advised the relevant polling stations to use carbon pens.”

“The Election Commission, however, would like to make voters aware that no ballot paper marked with pencils instead of carbon pens will be invalidated and not to have any doubts on this.” (Colombo/September 21/2024)
