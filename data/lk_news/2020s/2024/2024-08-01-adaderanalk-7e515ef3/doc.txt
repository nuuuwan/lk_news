Sri Lanka to repatriate expatriate workers if Iran conflict escalates

Amid rising tensions in Iran following the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, Sri Lanka’s Foreign Minister Ali Sabry assured that the government has a plan in place to repatriate Sri Lankan expatriate workers in the region in the event the conflict escalates to violence.

Minister Sabry also affirmed that the President has appointed two committees to monitor this situation and to take necessary measures.

“Yesterday, the President instructed us not to leave anything to chance and to be ready for every eventuality. That is why he appointed 2 committees to monitor this situation and to take necessary measures”, he added.

“One of the committees will oversee security-related matters, which include vetting tourists from that region and ensuring Sri Lanka’s security. This committee comprises myself, ministers Tiran Alles and Manusha Nanayakkara and presidential advisor Sagala Rathnayake. Additionally, another committee has been appointed to oversee the process of repatriating Sri Lankan expatriate workers in the region back to Sri Lanka, in case the conflict escalates further”, the Foreign Minister added.

“We already had a plan in place for this situation in October, which we are now reviewing. In the event that the conflict escalates, we have a plan to take immediate action to safeguard the lives of Sri Lankans in the region”, he highlighted.

Meanwhile, the minister urged Sri Lankans not to seek foreign employment with visit visas, citing the recent predicament of Sri Lankans in Myanmar and Russia who failed to follow the proper channels for foreign employment.
