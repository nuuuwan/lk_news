Upgrading of Northern railway line to be completed by August

Minister of Highways, Transport, and Mass Media Dr. Bandula Gunawardena says that it is unlikely that the reconstruction work on the Northern railway track will be completed before the upcoming Poson Poya.

In response to a question raised by a journalist during a press conference held today (28), the minister explained that the development of the Northern railway line could be completed by August this year.

Meanwhile, he further stated that a special bus service will be implemented for the ‘Poson Poya’ holidays.

He said that the bus service will be implemented on the ‘Poson Poya’ day and the day before.

Minister Gunawardena also stated that an announcement will be made in relation to the schedule of the special bus service and special arrangements have also been made with the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) and the private sector bus operators in this regard.
