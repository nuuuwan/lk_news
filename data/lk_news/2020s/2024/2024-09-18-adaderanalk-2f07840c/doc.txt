Sajith says exam paper leaks will be resolve under his govt

The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) presidential candidate Sajith Premadasa says that the injustice faced by the children who sat for the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination this year will be rectified under his government.

He expressed these views while joining the public rally in Kegalle area.

“Ranil Wickramasinghe says that he “can”. Now the person who “can”, can’t even prevent the question paper of the Grade 5 scholarship exam held by the government under him from being leaked,” he charged.

“What has happened now, the three leaked questions are to be removed,” he said, adding that it is a serious injustice to hundreds of thousands of children who faced the scholarship exam.

The Opposition Leader assured that they would investigate into this repeating issue of examination papers being leaked and vowed to take the strictest possible action against those found responsible.

“We will look into this conspiracy of leaking examination papers which has been created in the country’s education system. We will take the most severe decision possible for those responsible,” Premadasa said.

“I would like to say to the President that everything you do getting ‘leaked’. Stop the leakage.”

“The injustice that happened to these children who faced the scholarship will be corrected under our government,” he assured.
