“No Stopping Us”: Public Security Chief Defies Critics

COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lanka's Public Security Minister, Tiran Alles, has vowed to continue the ongoing anti-crime operation despite mounting criticism and calls for its halt.

In a defiant press conference, Alles declared his intention to release a list of individuals allegedly obstructing the operation and hinted at potential public backlash against them.

"I will disclose a list of people who are against this, soon," Alles stated.

He dismissed concerns about prison overcrowding due to the operation's success, stating, "It is up to the Prisons department to set up facilities and commence operations."

Alles, emphasized the meticulous planning behind the operation and its unwavering continuation.

"Any right-minded person will have no reason to oppose this," Alles asserted. "I have nothing to gain and nothing to lose. It is the same for the Police Chief."

He further challenged any potential opposition, stating, "If someone is not allowing me to function as the Minister, I will leave. I have nothing to gain."

The Minister's strong stance against criticism extended to international organizations. "When the UN Human Rights letter reached us, I disregarded it," he declared. "Let them send letters. A handful of NGO operators and their lawyers send letters overseas, and in response, statements are issued. I will not falter in the face of these things."
