Sri Lanka stocks close down, foreign inflows account for 50-pct of turnover

ECONOMYNEXT – The Colombo Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, data on its site showed.

The broader All Share Index closed down 0.92 percent, or 110.55 points, at 11,926; while the more liquid S&P SL20 Index closed down 1.08 percent, or 38.39 points, at 3,505.

Turnover was 1.9 million. A large part of this was from foreign buying. There was a net foreign inflow of 972 million.

“Foreign interest in stable companies is continuing,” Softlogic Stockbrokers said. “With the positive news from the IMF, OCC and the ISBs, and a possible rating revision, we see that foreign investors are taking active positions on companies with solid fundamentals.”

Foreign interest was especially seen on John Keells Holdings Plc Rs679mn (closed flat at 203.00).

Sampath Bank Plc, one of five crossings in the day, also saw foreign buying interest. The share closed down at 78.00.

“We think that part of the reason market was down despite encouraging news coming in, is perhaps some profit taking   could be taking place.”

Sri Lanka has reached a deal with bondholders involving hair cuts of 28 percent on bonds and 11 percent on interest arrears with the principal on some securities called macro-linked bonds to 15 percent if GDP grows at higher speeds. (Colombo/Jul4/2024)
