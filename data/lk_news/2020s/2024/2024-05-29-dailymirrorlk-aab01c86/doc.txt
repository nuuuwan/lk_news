Teachers, principals to launch two-day islandwide sick leave campaign tomorrow

Colombo, May 29 (Daily Mirror) - The National Teachers' Power (NTP) has decided to launch an islandwide two-day sick leave campaign starting tomorrow (30), demanding the government to resolve the salary anomalies of school principals and teachers.

Addressing the media NTP national organiser and media spokesman Amuthu Bandara told the Daily Mirror that they had protested on the streets during the past 27 years in search of solutions to the salary anomalies.

"We held a sick leave campaign on March 28, and we gave the rulers of the country a chance, but they did not listen. Therefore, the NTP has decided to launch the two-day sick leave campaign tomorrow," he said.

“There is a responsibility for the 225 MPs in the Parliament to have a debate on this issue, as they were elected to Parliament with the vote cast by the teachers and principals as well.

“Other than issuing vehicle permits to parliamentarians, it is very essential to provide solutions to the existing salary anomaly issues. The NTP demands the President and the Education Minister take immediate action to resolve this salary anomaly issue before Poson Poya (June 21).

“If not, we will take our best actions to stop your political future. The politicians still do not understand the power of the teachers and principals,” Bandara said.

Meanwhile, NTP advisor Venerable Akmeemana Dhammarathana Thera also requested all teachers and principals to join the two-day trade union action by applying for medical leave.

Meanwhile, Ceylon Teachers' Union (CTU) secretary, Joseph Stalin and Ceylon Teachers' Services Union (CTSU) general secretary, Mahinda Jayasinghe told the Daily Mirror that they will not engage in the two-day sick leave campaign tomorrow.
