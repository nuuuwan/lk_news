Man arrested for sexually harassing police officer in public transport

Police have arrested a 44-year-old suspect for allegedly sexually harassing a female police officer onboard a public transport bus.

According to police, the suspect, identified as a private security officer from Welimada, was remanded until 22 February on orders of the Nuwara Eliya Magistrate’s Court.

The victimised police officer had reportedly been aboard the bus as part of an ongoing operation aimed at preventing the sexual harassment of women and children in public transport.

The special programme is being operated in conjunction with the ongoing anti-drug operation ‘Yukthiya’, and those subjected to such harassment have been urged to inform the police via the ‘109’ hotline.
