A five-judge bench of the Supreme Court, headed by the Chief Justice, is set to hear the Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed by businessman C.D. Lenawa, seeking to delay the announcement of the presidential election, on Monday (08).

The petition requests that an interim order be issued to prevent the calling of the presidential election within the currently scheduled period, until the Supreme Court provides its interpretation on the date of the poll.
