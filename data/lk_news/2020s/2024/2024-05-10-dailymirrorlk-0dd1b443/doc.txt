CID tells Maithripala’s statements contradict each other

Colombo, May 10 (Daily Mirror) -  The Criminal Investigations Department (CID) conducting investigations into the controversial revelation made by former President Maithripala Sirisena regarding the Easter Sunday bomb attacks, informed court that his two statements given to the CID and evidence gathered from CCTV footage contradict each other.

Counsel Rajitha Lakmal, appearing for Parliamentarian Kavinda Jayawardena, moved the court to issue an order for the former President's arrest if he has provided false statements by concealing the truth. Considering the facts, Maligakanda Magistrate Lochani Abeywickrema directed the CID to take necessary action regarding former President Sirisena if he has committed something with criminal liability. The progress of the investigation was ordered to be reported to the court on July 26.

The CID had filed a facts report before Maligakanda Magistrate's Court regarding the statement the former President had made recently. Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles had instructed the Inspector General of Police to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the statement made by the former President in Kandy that he knew the people involved in the Easter Sunday bomb attacks on 21 April 2019.
