Constitutional Council has not approved Deshabanduâ€™s appointment: Sajith

Colombo, Feb 26 (Daily Mirror) - Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said the Constitutional Council (CC) has not approved the appointment of Deshabandu Tennakoon as the new IGP.

"There were four votes in favour, 2 against while two members of the CC abstained. At least five votes are required for a decision. The Speaker has a casting vote only in case of a tie. There was no tie. The Constitution has been blatantly violated for the second time," he said.
