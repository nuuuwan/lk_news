SLMC offers conditional support to Sajith

The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) has decided to extend conditional support to Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa in the upcoming Presidential Election.

Speaking to the media, SLMC leader Rauff Hakeem said the decision to support Premadasa was taken by the party’s Supreme Council during a meeting held yesterday.

However, Hakeem said the party’s support for Premadasa will be contingent upon certain conditions. He mentioned that the SLMC will soon engage in discussions with Premadasa to aim for an agreement on specific issues during those talks.

However, Hakeem said the SLMC will not align with any other political party and will not seek ministerial or other positions following the upcoming Presidential Election in return for supporting the Samagi Jana Balawegaya led by Premadasa.
