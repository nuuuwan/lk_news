Marriott International’s annual charity “Road to give” today

The Marriott International’s annual charity “Road to give” will be held today from 6.00 a.m. to 11.00 a.m.

With the participation of 4 hotels and resorts under the Marriott Business Council which includes Sheraton Colombo, ITC Ratnadipa, Sheraton Kosgoda Turtle Beach Resort and Courtyard by Marriott Colombo, this walk will support the Indira Cancer Trust with the aim of generating further awareness and recognising the inequities in cancer care.

This walk also encourages Marriott International associates to support meaningful local causes while engaging in different types of movement for their physical and mental well-being. “Road to give” will be open to all Associates and the public who wish to be a part of this initiative. The walk will commence at the Sheraton Colombo inviting participants to walk approximately 4.5 km, leading up to the Bank of Ceylon Tower with the finish point being ITC Ratnadipa.

This annual charity event is an integral part of the Marriott South Asia calendar and is a testament to the company’s commitment to cultivate a people-first environment.

“We are proud to be a part of this initiative and see our hotels come together for this fundraiser” said Sheraton Colombo General Manager and Sri Lanka Marriott Business Council Chairman Rahul Maini, spearheading this global initiative in Sri Lanka. “We are equally proud of our associates and their passion and eager participation towards this important cause” he further stated.

The participating hotels invite all those interested in supporting a meaningful cause to join hands with Marriott International and contribute to the Indira Cancer Trust. Your support will play a pivotal role in providing breast prostheses and hair wigs during the month of October, offering essential care, dignity, and comfort to cancer patients in their journey to recovery.
