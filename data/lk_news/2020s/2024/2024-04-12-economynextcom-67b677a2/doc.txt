Sri Lanka Yukthiya operations leading addicts to seek Ayurveda high

ECONOMYNEXT – A shortage of drugs due to the Yukthiya crackdown has led some addicts to look for alternative medicines, State Minister of Indigenous Medicine Sisira Jayakody said.

“The shortage of pharmaceuticals has led some individuals addicted to drugs to turn to certain alternative medicines within the indigenous medical system, Jayakody said at a press briefing last week.

Sri Lanka allows cannabis to be used in the manufacture of ayurvedic medicine. Raw materials in Ayurvedic medicine include several parts of the cannabis plant, as well as abin (Papaver somniferum Linn), in herbal remedies.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that over-the-counter products available at shops that sell ayurveda products (sinhala beheth) provide varying degrees of relaxation or stimulation.

Jayakody said a written notification has been sent to Public Security Minister Tiran Alles and the Inspector General of Police regarding the challenges faced by the indigenous medical sector due to operation ‘Yukthiya’.

“Nevertheless, we have urged them to allocate space for uninterrupted production of indigenous medicines.”

Jayakody said a special unit has also been set up to address issues faced by traditional medical practitioners, and to safeguard the indigenous medicine system.

The island nation’s latest drug-busting Yukthiya programme has been widely criticized by local and international rights groups citing it was violating the human rights of suspected drug users. (Colombo/Apr12/2024)
