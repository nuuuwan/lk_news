Secret Behind Singapore’s Success and Sri Lanka’s Failure — My Talk with Kishore Mahbubani – Part 1

He possesses a captivating intellect and spending even a few minutes with him feels like an extraordinary privilege. He, who identified himself as an “accidental diplomat,” was Singapore’s Ambassador to the UN and then served as the President of the United Nations Security Council. Kishore Mahbubani, an esteemed scholar, diplomat, and author, is well-known for his incisive analyses of global geopolitics and economic development.

In his book The Asian 21st Century, Mahbubani presents a compelling argument for the centrality of Asia in shaping the global order of the future. He contends that the 21st century will not only be an Asian century but one where the lessons from Asian societies can provide critical insights into tackling global challenges. In this book, he emphasises that “the Asian way of thinking, characterised by pragmatism and a deep respect for the complexities of history, can offer solutions to the multifaceted problems facing humanity.”

Mahbubani’s intellectual journey is deeply rooted in his childhood and family background. Growing up in Singapore during the tumultuous period of the 1960s, he witnessed first-hand the struggles and aspirations of a newly independent nation. His mother, a homemaker who valued education immensely, instilled in him a profound respect for learning and critical thinking. In his writings, he often reflects on how her influence shaped his world-view, stating, “My mother taught me that education was the most powerful tool for change.” This belief in the transformative power of education has guided his career, fuelling his desire to elevate the discourse around development and governance.

As a child, Mahbubani was surrounded by Singapore’s vibrant multicultural society, which further enriched his understanding of the world. He often speaks of the harmony that characterised his upbringing, noting how different cultures coexisted peacefully. This multicultural backdrop laid the foundation for his later work in diplomacy, where he championed dialogue and mutual understanding among nations. His formative experiences have driven his belief that societies thrive when they embrace diversity and foster collaboration.

Last week, I sat down with Professor Kishore Mahbubani to discuss some of the emerging issues in Asia. He offered a deep analysis of the key factors driving Singapore’s economic success, contrasting it sharply with the challenges faced by other small nations like Sri Lanka. His insights not only shed light on Singapore’s remarkable achievements but also outline potential strategies for other countries striving to replicate its success.

He began by addressing the initial scepticism that surrounded Singapore’s future at the time of its independence in 1965. The founding leaders, including Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Keng Swee, believed they faced insurmountable challenges. Remarkably, they envied Sri Lanka, viewing it as a peaceful and prosperous nation. “They thought Sri Lanka was peaceful and prosperous, and their dream was to become like Sri Lanka,” Mahbubani recalled. However, history unfolded differently, and Singapore emerged as a global powerhouse while Sri Lanka faced economic difficulties.

Mahbubani’s analysis reveals a critical turning point: “Sri Lanka could easily have been as successful as Singapore, if not more successful, if it had followed the same secret formula of Singapore’s success.” He articulated this formula succinctly as the MPH formula, emphasising three core tenets: meritocracy, pragmatism, and honesty.

Meritocracy, according to Mahbubani, involves selecting individuals for leadership roles based solely on their abilities rather than their ethnic backgrounds. “We just pick the best candidate,” he asserted, pointing out that even though Singapore’s population is predominantly Chinese, leaders like S. Rajaratnam, a Sri Lankan Tamil, were chosen based on their competence. This commitment to meritocracy is starkly contrasted with practises in many countries where nepotism and favouritism often dominate. Mahbubani’s assertion that “meritocracy is the first reason for Singapore’s success” resonates deeply with the ethos of governance in the city-state.

The second component of the MPH formula, pragmatism, highlights Singapore’s approach to problem-solving. Mahbubani recounted the wisdom of Dr. Goh Keng Swee, who advised, “No matter what problem Singapore encounters, somebody somewhere has encountered the same problem.” This perspective encouraged Singaporean leaders to learn from the experiences of other nations, particularly Japan, which had successfully modernised by adopting best practises from various countries. “It’s surprising that other countries like Sri Lanka or others have not copied Singapore,” he noted, stressing the ease of learning from successful models rather than reinventing the wheel.

The final element of the MPH formula, honesty, is the most challenging to maintain. Mahbubani highlighted Singapore’s achievement of “near zero corruption,” underscoring that while no society is entirely free from corruption, Singapore has come remarkably close. “There’s always some degree of corruption, but Singapore has achieved near zero,” he affirmed. This commitment to integrity is critical in fostering trust and stability, essential ingredients for economic growth. He further elaborated, stating, “In a society where trust is maintained, the economy can thrive.”

As the conversation shifted toward Singapore’s democratic processes, Mahbubani addressed the often-cited criticisms regarding the political landscape. He asserted, “In Singapore, no one questions the fact that every five years, the people of Singapore go for elections.” He emphasised that the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) remains in power through democratic means, receiving support from a significant majority of the electorate. “The PAP is in power not because of dictatorial means,” he explained, “but because the people of Singapore have voted for the government to stay.” This statement challenges the narrative that Singapore’s success is solely a product of autocratic governance.

Mahbubani elaborated on the notion of accountability in governance. He believes that good governance is inherently tied to the effectiveness of public administration, stating, “Effective governance is like a fine-tuned engine; it requires constant attention and maintenance.” This perspective underlines the importance of responsiveness in leadership, a critical factor that enables Singapore to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing global environment.

The discussion then turned to the broader geopolitical landscape, particularly concerning China’s rise as a global power. Mahbubani noted the complexities that smaller nations face in this context. “As China is rising, the United States has decided that the rise of China is a challenge to the United States,” he remarked. This has led to a significant geopolitical contest, where nations must navigate their relationships with both China and the United States. Mahbubani emphasised that ASEAN countries have been clear in their desire not to take sides in this rivalry, aiming instead for amicable relations with both superpowers.

He further elaborated on the implications of this geopolitical tension. “It is important for all Asian states, like the ASEAN states, like Sri Lanka, to speak out and say that we want to be friends with both,” he advised, underscoring the need for diplomatic agility in a rapidly changing world. Mahbubani’s approach highlights the necessity of balancing relationships in a multipolar world, where power dynamics are continuously shifting.

As the conversation deepened, Mahbubani reflected on the commentary made by Amerian geopolitical analysts like George Friedman regarding China’s increasing military might. “The question Friedman should ask is why is the United States spending more on defence than the next ten countries combined?” he said, highlighting the disproportionate military expenditures of the U.S. compared to China’s relatively modest investments. He pointed out that while China’s defence spending has increased, it remains consistent as a percentage of its GDP, a nuance often overlooked in discussions of military power.

In addressing the U.S.’s global military presence, Mahbubani contended, “The United States is the only major developed country where the average income of the bottom 50% has gone down.” He argued that the U.S. should reallocate its resources from maintaining a vast military presence worldwide to improving the welfare of its own citizens. “Instead of spending money to protect its primacy in the global system,” he suggested, “it should spend its money to help its own people.”

The dialogue then shifted toward the concept of an ASEAN-NATO alliance, which Mahbubani approached with scepticism. He criticised the notion as lacking understanding of Asia’s unique geopolitical context. “The Europeans have become geopolitically incompetent,” he stated, noting the EU’s struggles compared to ASEAN’s stability and growth.

Mahbubani argued that instead of lecturing Asian countries, Europeans should learn from the successes of the ASEAN model. He pointed out, “The tragedy about the Europeans is that they don’t seem to understand that instead of lecturing the rest of the world, they should learn from the rest of the world.” This call for humility in international relations reflects Mahbubani’s broader advocacy for a multipolar world where diverse perspectives are respected and valued.

In this context, he articulated a broader vision for regional cooperation. “The future of regional security lies in collaboration, not confrontation,” he asserted.

In these tumultuous times, Mahbubani’s work urges us to embrace the complexities of our world with a spirit of collaboration and understanding. It is a call to action for leaders and citizens alike to recognise that the future of our interconnected globe hinges on our ability to learn from one another and work together toward a common purpose. As Mahbubani eloquently put it, “The path to progress lies not only in recognising the unique challenges faced by each nation but also in fostering a spirit of collaboration that transcends borders.” This vision, rooted in a deep respect for humanity and the shared challenges we face, remains a guiding light in the pursuit of a better future for all.
