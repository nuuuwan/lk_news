Siyambalapitiya clears the air on reports concerning rice imports

The government has not given permission to import rice, Finance State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya says.

Addressing the reports claiming otherwise, the lawmaker clarified that only Basmati rice is permitted to be imported for the requirement of tourist hotels.

Rice imports were green-lighted in February when the country was on the verge of facing a rice shortage, he explained, adding that the rice stocks imported during this period but had been stuck at the port were later allowed to be cleared within a period of one week.
