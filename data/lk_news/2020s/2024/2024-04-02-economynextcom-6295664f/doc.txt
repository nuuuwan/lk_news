Sri Lanka President appoints Wijerathne as new DG for CIABOC with wide powers

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe appointed High Court Judge W. K. D. Wijerathne as the Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, which has wide powers under the new Anti Corruption Act.

Wijerathne has functioned in the same role before, but this new appointment is under the new Act which was passed in the parliament in September last year.

The new Act is one of the commitments President Wickremesinghe’s government made to the International Monetary Fund in return to its $3 billion loan.

The new Act has empowered CIABOC, granting it more authority to effectively investigate and prosecute cases of bribery and corruption.

The anti-graft body in the past has investigated into the allegations of bribery and corruptions, but has failed to live up to the expectation because most complaints did not see prosecutions.

The new Anti-Corruption Act has aimed at enhancing transparency in governance and public confidence in the government, while establishing an independent commission to detect and investigate allegations of bribery, corruption and offenses related to the declaration of assets and liabilities.

It also seeks to give effect to obligations under the United Nations Convention against corruption and any other international convention on the prevention of corruption. (Colombo/April 2/2024)
