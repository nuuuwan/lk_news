Person injured during SJB protest in Colombo hospitalized

An individual has been admitted to the Colombo National Hospital after reportedly sustaining injuries during the protest march staged by the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) on Tuesday (30 Jan.).

According to the hospital’s Director of Accident Services, the person had sustained injuries when police had fired tear gas and water cannons near the Public Library in Colombo, in an attempt to disperse the SJB protesters.

Attended by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, SJB MPs and party supporters, the agitation was organized by the main opposition in protest of the conduct of the government.

Earlier today, three court orders were issued ahead of the SJB’s protest march, barring the demonstrators from entering certain locations in Colombo including the Finance Ministry, the Presidential Secretariat, the President’s House and Galle Face Green.

They were also banned from causing inconveniences to motorists and pedestrians travelling along Dean’s Road, Lipton Roundabout, Maradana Junction, T.B. Jayah Mawatha, Olcott Mawatha, the Technical Junction and other areas in Colombo this evening.
