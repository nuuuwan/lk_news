Two-thirds of CEB employee loan interests paid by consumers - Minister

Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera has revealed that two-thirds of the employees’ loan interest paid by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is recovered from consumer tariffs and that financial facilities to the tune of Rs. 12 billion are granted to the employees.

Taking to ‘X’ (formerly Twitter), the Minister stated that as per the data received by the CEB finance division, upon his request, a total of nearly Rs. 12 billion is spent by the state-owned institution for financial facilities extended to their employees.

Responding to the shocking revelation that the interest paid by the CEB to its employees is recovered through consumer tariffs, the Minister noted that CEB has been instructed to implement a mechanism through which the said money is recovered from the beneficiaries of loans, instead of  the consumers.

“I have directed the CEB management to implement a mechanism to recover the loan & interest amounts from the beneficiaries of the loans & not to pass it to the electricity consumers”.

Meanwhile, CEB has also been directed to report on any services that can be potentially outsourced in the future, in a bid to increase efficiency while also reducing costs
