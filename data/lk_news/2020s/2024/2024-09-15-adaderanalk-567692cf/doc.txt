Dilith Jayaweera advocates for greater economic inclusion of women in Sri Lanka

The presidential candidate of the ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ alliance, entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera emphasized his commitment to integrating more women into Sri Lanka’s economic landscape.

Addressing a rally held in Kalalgoda, Jayaweera highlighted the pivotal role women play in both family and national prosperity, stating: “One of the primary reasons for my political foray is the women of Sri Lanka. For years, I have been advocating for greater recognition of their role in our society. We need to harness and support the entrepreneurship of Sri Lankan women.”

“Despite the challenges of a reduced household income and soaring living costs, Sri Lankan women have maintained the integrity and happiness of their families. This is a testament to their entrepreneurial spirit,” he remarked.

He noted that women constitute 53% of the population, yet many remain underrepresented in the economic sector.

“To enhance Sri Lanka’s GDP, we must ensure that women are more actively involved in the economic process. The management skills demonstrated by women in maintaining family happiness are akin to entrepreneurship. By recognizing and expanding these skills into broader economic roles, we can drive national growth,” Jayaweera argued.

He further said: “Sri Lankan women have the capacity to become stars in our economic sphere, given their proven ability to manage and nurture their families. Their potential to influence and drive economic success is immense.”
