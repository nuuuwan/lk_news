Postponing elections not healthy for democracy: Namal

Colombo, May 28 - In the wake of the proposal made by UNP General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara over holding a referendum to extend the term of the President and Parliament, MP Namal Rajapaksa said such a move undermines the fundamental principles.

Taking to 'X', MP Rajapaksa said, "Postponing elections is not healthy for any democracy. Extending the terms of the President and Parliament undermines the fundamental principles of a democratic society. Stability should come through the will of the people, not by delaying their voice."
