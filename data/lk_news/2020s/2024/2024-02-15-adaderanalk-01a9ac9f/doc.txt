OnmaxDT director has secretly left the country, court told

One of the six directors of the company ‘OnmaxDT’, who were arrested and later granted bail over allegations concerning the operating of a Pyramid scheme, has secretly fled the country.

The investigation officers had revealed this to court when the case pertaining to the alleged financial fraud was taken up before the Colombo Magistrate’s Court today (15).

Thus, the investigation officers have pointed out that the sixth suspect of the case, Dhananjaya Jayan Chamara had secretly left the country in this manner, and that investigations are underway with the assistance of Interpol, in order to trace and apprehend the suspect.

Colombo Chief Magistrate Prasanna Alwis ordered the case to be postponed until May 02, 2024.

Meanwhile, a group of individuals who had invested their money with OnmaxDT Pvt Ltd. carried out a protest in front of the Colombo Magistrate’s Court today. Later, a tense situation had arisen as the depositors protested against the directors of the company in question and blocked their vehicle as they were leaving the court premises.

Police officers had then proceeded to intervene in order to bring the situation under control.

On 24 August 2023, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) banned 9 entities, including ‘OnmaxDT’, that have conducted pyramid schemes which are prohibited in the country, warning that any person, who directly or indirectly initiates, offers, promotes, advertises, conducts, finances, manages or directs a prohibited type of pyramid scheme shall be guilty of punishable offence.

The Directors of ‘OnmaxDT’ were arrested by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) on November 03, 2023. The Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court on November 16 ordered for them to be released on three surety bails of Rs. 10 million each, and also imposed a bail condition that the suspects should report to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on the last Sunday of every month.
