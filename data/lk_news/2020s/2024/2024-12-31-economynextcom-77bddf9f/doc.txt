Sri Lanka Central Bank report to parliament on inflation falling below 3-pct

ECONOMYNEXT – A report from the central bank in inflation falling below the lower limit of its 5 percent inflation targeting will be presented to the parliament through the Finance Minister, cabinet spokesman Nalinda Jayatissa said.

Sri Lanka’s central bank has persuaded then President Ranil Wickremesinghe who was elected by parliament following an inflation crisis created by rate cuts and ousted in the ensuing stabilization crisis, to allow a 5 percent inflation target plus or minus 2 percent.

Unlike countries with monetary stability which have and achieve inflation of 2 percent or below, Sri Lanka was hit by four currency crises since the end of a civil war while targeting 5 percent inflation and eventually defaulted.

Under the agreement signed with political leadership the agency can create up to 7 percent inflation.

Sri Lanka’s central bank has followed broadly deflationary policy since late 2022 and also appreciated the currency bring inflation to a halt and also build monetary reserves.

In the second and third quarters inflation was only 1.4 percent and 0.8 percent and under the central bank law section 25(5) a report had to be presented parliament, Minister Jayatissa said.

Under exceptional monetary policy (and exchange rate policy), Sri Lanka’s central banks actions resulted in 12-month deflation. (Colombo/Dec31/2024)
