Importers issue clarification on milk powder prices

A final decision has yet to be taken regarding reducing the prices of imported milk powder, the importers say.

The media spokesperson of the Milk Powder Importers’ Association, Ashoka Bandara noted that an official meeting on the matter has not been held as of yet.

In March, the importers slashed the price of a 1-kilogram milk powder packet by Rs. 150 and a 400-gram packet by Rs. 60. It is understood that following the price drop, imported milk packets are being sold at various rates in the local market.

Against this backdrop, a company that imports milk powder from New Zealand on Wednesday (24) said that it would once again reduce the prices with effect from today. As per the statement, the price of a 1-kilogram packet was supposed to be dropped by Rs. 250 and a 400-gram packet by around Rs. 100-140.

However, the Milk Powder Importers’ Association asserted that it was in no way involved with the said statement.
