SriLankan Airlines to continue partnership with Plusgrade Inc. for enhanced bidding services

The Cabinet of Ministers has approved awarding of the contract to Plusgrade Inc., for a duration of five years, to continue its partnership with the national carrier, SriLankan Airlines Ltd., to provide bidding services and related ancillary services for automatic booking of upper-class seats.

The decision follows a successful international competitive bidding process in which two bids were received.

This approval comes after thorough evaluation by the Technical Evaluation Committee and the Standing Procurement Committee appointed by the Cabinet of Ministers.

The Plusgrade system allows passengers holding economy class tickets to bid for available business class seats, thus offering a chance to upgrade their travel experience. This service not only enhances passenger satisfaction but also increases revenue for the airline by filling unreserved business class seats.

The Plusgrade system has proven to be a valuable tool for SriLankan Airlines, optimising seat occupancy and providing a seamless upgrade experience for passengers.

The proposal for the continuation of this service submitted by Ports, Shipping and Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva received the Cabinetâ€™s endorsement.
