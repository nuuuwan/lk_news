We are committed to advocating for policies that support our industry and integrating cutting-edge technology to achieve higher solar energy penetration,” he said.

The Association extends an invitation to all organisations involved in the solar industry to join SIA. By becoming a member, stakeholders can contribute to and benefit from the association’s efforts to foster a sustainable and profitable solar industry in Sri Lanka.
