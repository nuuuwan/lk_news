Ampara SLTB depot officers interdicted over bus license plate switching

All individuals implicated in the deceptive act of switching license plates on two buses at the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) Bus Depot in Ampara have been interdicted, as announced by Minister of Transport Bandula Gunawardena.

The scandal unfolded during the second phase of the project aimed at renovating 200 out-of-service buses and reintegrating them into passenger transport services. This initiative, held on February 9, 2024, was graced by the presence of Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena and Minister Gunawardena. The government had reportedly allocated a substantial sum of Rs. 270 million for the renovation, with the Ampara SLTB Bus Depot receiving Rs. 2 million for its refurbishment activities.

However, it has come to light that officials at the Ampara SLTB Bus Depot deceptively switched the license plates of a bus designated for renovation. The altered license plate had been then affixed to another operational bus, misleadingly incorporating it into the event showcasing the launch of renovated buses for passenger transport services.
