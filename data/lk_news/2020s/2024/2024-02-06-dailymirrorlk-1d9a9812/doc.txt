Herath says no to BCB: Bangladesh Cricket in limbo with key positions vacant

Feb. 6 (insidesport) - With the top players currently involved in the ongoing BPL and the talented youngsters participating in the U19 World Cup, there's a sense of waiting and wondering about the team's next steps.

Sri Lankan spin legend Rangana Herath has declined a new offer from the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), leaving the national team’s spin bowling mentor position vacant. This adds to the BCB’s woes as they grapple with several key coaching positions needing to be filled and the national team yet to play an international match in 2024.

The lack of official matches scheduled for the national team further compounds the uncertainty surrounding Bangladesh cricket. With the top players currently involved in the ongoing BPL and the talented youngsters participating in the U19 World Cup, there’s a sense of waiting and wondering about the team’s next steps.

Fans eagerly await the announcement of the upcoming Sri Lanka series, scheduled for two Tests, three ODIs, and three T20Is, as per the ICC’s Future Tours Programme (FTP). However, with key coaching positions unfilled and no international matches on the horizon, the immediate future of Bangladesh cricket remains unclear.

This situation raises questions about the BCB’s planning and direction. Can they attract high-caliber coaches amidst these uncertainties? How will they manage the team’s preparation without regular international exposure? Only time will tell how Bangladesh cricket navigates these challenges and finds its way back to the international stage.
