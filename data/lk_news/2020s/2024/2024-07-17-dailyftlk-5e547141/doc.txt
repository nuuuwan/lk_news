Colombo Port City (Charges) Orders for Parliament

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the proposal presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as the Investment Promotion Minister, to submit the Colombo Port City (Charges) Orders to Parliament.

The move is in accordance with Section 71 of the Act and the Colombo Port City (Charges) Orders No. 2 of 2024, was imposed by gazette notification on 6 June.

These orders, enacted under the provisions of the Colombo Port City Economic Commission Act No. 11 of 2021, require Parliamentary approval within three months of their publication in the Government gazette.

The orders, declared in Extraordinary Gazette No. 2387/38, are designed to regulate charges within the Colombo Port City, a key economic zone.

The move is a step towards ensuring that the regulations governing the economic activities within the Port City are aligned with the broader legislative framework and receive the necessary legislative oversight.
