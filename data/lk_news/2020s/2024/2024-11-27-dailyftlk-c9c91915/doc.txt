Cabinet Spokesman guarantees CEB bonuses will not hinder tariff relief for electricity users

The Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa yesterday guaranteed that the bonuses to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) employees will not hinder the relief promised to the electricity users.

He opined that the CEB should balance administrative responsibilities and trade union negotiations without affecting its commitments to the public or delaying critical decisions.

“Administration is one thing and trade union demands are another,” he said responding to a question raised at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

He said there is no direct connection between the trade union’s demand and the Board of Directors or the decision-makers.

“Trade unions are simply trying to secure their rights. However, managing these demands, while meeting the PUCSL’s deadline for proposals is the responsibility of the CEB,” he said.

The electricity regulator — Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) on Monday gave an ultimatum to the CEB till 6 December to submit the proposal for tariff revision, which was a key promise made by the National People’s Power (NPP) Government during the Presidential and Parliamentary elections.

Dr. Jayatissa emphasised that the tariff revision would provide tangible benefits to electricity users by reducing costs — including production and transmission expenses.

“This proposal will be conveyed to the CEB through Power and Energy Minister,” he added.
