Sri Lanka unveils ‘Govt. Action Plan’ based on IMF governance diagnostic assessment

The Finance Ministry on Thursday (Feb.29) unveiled the Government Action Plan, which was prepared based on the Governance Diagnostic Assessment (GDA) furnished by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Taking to his X handle (formerly Twitter), Finance State Minister Shehan Semasinghe said this action plan further demonstrates the Sri Lankan government’s commitment to building a sustainable economy and good governance in the country.

The IMF had prepared the governance diagnostic report at the request of Sri Lanka, and the publication was deemed imperative for the authorities to adopt their own action plan to implement the recommendations in the assessment, beyond the priority commitments under the EFF arrangement.

Sri Lanka is the first country in Asia to have undergone the IMF Governance Diagnostic exercise.

The IMF earlier lauded the timely publication of the GDA, highlighting that it was a commendable first step towards addressing deep-rooted corruption weaknesses.
