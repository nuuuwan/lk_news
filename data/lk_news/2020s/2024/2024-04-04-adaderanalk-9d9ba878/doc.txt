Duminda, Lasantha and Amaraweera extend invitation for ‘new journey’ with SLFP

Former National Organiser of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MP Duminda Dissanayake says they are inviting everyone to join a new journey with the SLFP.

MPs Duminda Dissanayake, Lasantha Alagiyawanna and Mahinda Amaraweera, who were recently removed from their respective positions within the party, had called a ‘Sri Lanka Freedom Party’ press conference today (04), against the backdrop where a court order was issued preventing former President Maithripala Sirisena from functioning as the party’s chairman.

The press conference was held at the SLFP Headquarters in Colombo 10.

Speaking further, they emphasized: “Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike had resorted to legal action as she could not wait and see this destruction [of the SLFP]. Accordingly, an injunction has been issued on Maithripala Sirisena, preventing him from functioning as the party’s chairman.”
