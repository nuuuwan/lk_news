Stock of drugs worth over Rs. 5 million found from house of suspect shot by cops

Police have today recovered a stock of drugs worth more than Rs. 5,000,000 from the rented house of drug trafficker Sahan Dhananjaya, alias “Kona,” who was shot while fleeing from police officers after pointing a firearm at them.

Athurugiriya Police had received information that ‘Kona’, a known drug trafficker, was transporting drugs from Kottawa to the Piliyandala area on July 4.

Acting on this intelligence, the police had conducted a special traffic inspection at the Friday ‘Pola’ (fair) junction in Piliyandala.

During the inspection, a person had exited a car that had been stopped by police and brandished a firearm at the officers. In response, the police officers had opened fire at him.

Despite the police firing at him, the individual had managed to flee, and his bullet-ridden car was later found abandoned in the Kesbewa area.

The suspect was subsequently apprehended while receiving medical treatment at the Kalubowila Teaching Hospital for a gunshot wound in his leg.

‘Kona’ was arrested along with his wife, and following their interrogation, the police searched their rented house in the Halpita area of Polgasowita.

During the search, officers discovered various types of drugs, including cocaine, crystal methamphetamine (‘Ice’), and Kerala cannabis, with a total estimated street value exceeding Rs. 5,000,000.

Further investigations revealed that ‘Kona’ had visited this house a few days prior to being shot. Upon questioning the suspect’s wife, it was disclosed that the house belonged to “Kalubowila Sudu Nona,” a prominent drug dealer in the Kalubowila area.

Following this revelation, the police also arrested ‘Kalubowila Sudu Nona’ today (07) and confiscated nearly 09 grams of ‘Ice’ drugs from her possession.

Both women have been remanded for seven days after being produced at the Kesbewa Magistrate’s Court.
