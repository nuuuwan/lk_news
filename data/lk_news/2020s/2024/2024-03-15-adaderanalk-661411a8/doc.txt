Keheliya submits bail application to high court

Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, who is in remand custody in connection with the substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) procurement, has submitted a bail application to the Colombo High Court.

Accordingly, the bail application has been fixed for consideration on March 18 (Monday).

The new development comes after the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court rejected bail for Rambukwella, former health secretary and 4 other accused in the case on Thursday (March 14).

Furthermore, the magistrate ordered them to be remanded in custody until the conclusion of the case under the provisions of the Public Property Act and fixed the case to be recalled on March 28.

Eight individuals including former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, former Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Chandragupta and Additional Secretary of the Health Ministry Dr. Saman Ratnayake currently remain under remand custody following their arrest in connection with the case.

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) had arrested Rambukwella on February 02 in connection with the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), when he arrived there, complying with a court order. He had been grilled for nearly 10 hours before being arrested.

The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker.

On February 29, Rambukwella’s attorneys also filed a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition challenging his arrest by the CID and demanding Rs. 100 million in compensation.

Prior to the apprehension of Rambukwella, seven arrests had been made in connection with the drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail.

Meanwhile on Wednesday (March 13), the CID arrested Dr. Thusitha Sudarshana, the Deputy Director of the Health Ministry’s Medical Supplies Division, after he surrendered to the CID based on summons, following his arrival in Sri Lanka from overseas.

In the meantime, Additional Secretary of the Health Ministry Dr. Ratnayake had recently made a 4-hour-long confidential statement to the Maligakanda Magistrate regarding the procurement of substandard IVIG.

In October 2023, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests.
