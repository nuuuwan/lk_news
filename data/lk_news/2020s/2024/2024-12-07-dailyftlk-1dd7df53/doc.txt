A sip of history: The enduring legacy of Dambatenne Estate

Nestled in the misty hills of Sri Lanka’s Uva Province is a living piece of Pure Ceylon Tea history in the form of Dambatenne Estate. Sprawling across the verdant slopes of Haputale, this iconic estate holds the legacy of one of the most famous names in tea — Sir Thomas Lipton. Dambatenne estate is a place where past and present converge, offering visitors a unique window into the origins of Sri Lanka’s tea industry and the enduring global reputation it continues to command.

Together with the father of Ceylon Tea himself, James Taylor whom at the time of Lipton’s arrival in then Ceylon, had already established Sri Lanka’s very first commercial tea plantation and factory at Loolecondera Estate, the duo set about the development of Pure Ceylon Tea that continues to form the foundation of the brand today.

Walking the estate’s picturesque paths today, to the scenic bungalow in which Sir Lipton himself resided – that is still maintained in pristine condition 134 years later, visitors trace the footsteps of a pioneer whose passion for tea reshaped Sri Lanka’s economy and revolutionised how the world consumes tea.

Founded in 1890, Dambatenne Estate was selected by Sir Thomas Lipton for its ideal tea-growing conditions: cool temperatures, rich soil, and abundant rainfall. Lipton’s visionary approach transformed these remote Sri Lankan highlands into a powerhouse of tea production, kindling a global tea empire that helped make high quality tea accessible to millions.

Lipton recognised the unique advantages of Dambatenne estate to produce tea leaves of exceptional quality almost instantly. His radical approach of bypassing the expensive brokers controlling the tea trade allowed him to bring tea “directly from the garden to the teapot”, while still making it affordable for the average consumer. This ground-breaking model laid the foundation for Lipton Tea, a global giant in tea that has been synonymous with quality, affordability, and innovation for generations.

Today, Dambatenne Estate spans a total of 873 hectares, including 376 hectares of tea and 183 hectares of forestry and high conservation sensitive areas. Following significant investments in replanting, over 74% of the estate’s tea is now vegetatively propagated, which has significantly increased the production of tea.

The estate’s rich history and legacy continue into the present day, with locations like the iconic Lipton seat remaining carefully preserved a tourist hotspot. Famed as Sir Thomas Lipton’s favourite vantage point, Lipton’s Seat offers stunning panoramic views of multiple provinces including Handapanagala Lake and Udawalawe Lake.

These sites are also being strategically developed, with a new tea centre being established at the location, to offer visitors from across the globe a chance to savour the living heritage of Dambatenne estate at the very same location as Sir Thomas Lipton himself.

For over a century, the estate has infused care and craftsmanship into every batch of tea it has produced, standing as a living testament to Lipton’s enduring legacy and the estate’s pivotal role in the rich history of Ceylon tea.
