Government approves housing programme for Sri Lankan overseas employees

Colombo, Feb 13 (Daily Mirror) - Cabinet approval was granted today to implement a housing programme for overseas employees.

The programme has been implemented by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) in collaboration with the National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) and licensed banks.

A maximum of Rs. 10 million is reportedly to be granted as a loan and a portion of this loan interest to be paid to the SLBFE.

The loan amount obtained under the proposed scheme should be paid by foreign exchange remitted through legitimate channels within the period that the receiver of the loan is engaged in overseas employment, and payments to be made in Sri Lankan rupees once the foreign employment is completed and the borrower returns to this country.

Accordingly, the Cabinet has approved the proposal by the Labour and Foreign Employment Minister to implement the proposed housing programme.
