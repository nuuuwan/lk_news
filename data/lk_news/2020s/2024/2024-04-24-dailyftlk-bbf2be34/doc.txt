Army appoints investigation panel to probe deadly Fox Hill crash

The Sri Lanka Army has appointed a seven-member panel led by a Major General to investigate the deadly accident that happened during the ‘Fox Hill Super Cross 2024’ racing event in Diyatalawa on Sunday.

As many as seven people including an 8-year-old girl lost their lives and more than 20 were injured after a car ran off the track during a race and ploughed into spectators.

Among the deceased were four event officials who had been stationed as flag marshals. The others were identified as spectators.

The crash happened soon after another car had overturned on the track. As the vehicles were speeding past, one red car veered off course and crashed into spectators on the side of the unguarded track.

Two drivers of the racing cars involved in the accident were subsequently arrested and remanded until 30 April on the orders of Bandarawela Magistrate’s Court.

Foxhill Supercross, organized by Sri Lanka Military Academy in Diyatalawa with the support of the Sri Lanka Automobile Sports (SLAS), is participated by both local and international top ranking racing drivers and riders.

The 28th edition of the event kicked off in Diyatalawa on Sunday following a 5-year hiatus. It was suspended after the tragic accident.

The organisers of the ‘Fox Hill Super Cross 2024’ motorsport racing event claimed that they had assured the safety of the spectators at the event and that tragic accident was caused by the carelessness of the spectators themselves.
