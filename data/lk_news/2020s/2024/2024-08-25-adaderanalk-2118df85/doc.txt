Additionally, the basic salary of state workers would be raised by 24%. We will also increase the monthly living expense allowances which currently stand at Rs 17,800 to Rs 25,000”, he said.

“Now let me reveal more on our relief package to the retired. The allowances given to elderly citizens will be raised from Rs 3,000 to Rs 5,000.The interest rate would be increased to 15%, which will increase the value of your savings. Insurance schemes will also be provided to those who retired before 2016”, he added

“Through the ‘One Rank-One Pay’ initiative, we aim to bolster the privileges of our war-veterans, police officers and officers of the civil defence force. Measures will also be taken to resolve the issues pertaining to the pensions of school teachers. These are some of the many proposals and plans of our party.”

Meanwhile, the SJB presidential candidate also outlined plans to access funds for the said projects. “Some question whether we have sufficient funds to commence these projects. Yes, we do!”

“Initially, we will cut down all the unnecessary expenses of the country. We will start by reducing the expenses of the President. I will not become a President who burdens the country. I will not tolerate corruption, fraud and theft under my tenure. I assure you that I will punish those who led the country towards destruction. I will definitely keep my word”, he added.
