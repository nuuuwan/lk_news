US Embassy Colombo to host Indo-Pacific Business Forum via satellite

The US Embassy in Colombo is set to host a satellite event of the Indo-Pacific Business Forum (IPBF) under the theme “Driving Sustainable Development in the Ports Sector” on 21 May.

The event will take place concurrently with the sixth Indo-Pacific Business Forum in Manila, Philippines, co-hosted by the US Trade Development Agency and the Government of the Philippines, in partnership with the US Department of State. Businesses and stakeholders from across the Indo-Pacific region are invited to participate in this significant event. For those unable to attend in person, online registration is available through the main website: IPBF | Indo-Pacific Business Forum (indopacificbusinessforum.com) #IndoPacificBizForum.

Sri Lanka Ports Authority, together with the Ministry of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation, seeks to transform the nation’s ports into efficient and sustainable facilities through a greening initiative. The initiative aims to enhance energy efficiency by reducing waste and emissions, while promoting environmentally responsible shipping and transportation practices and developing renewable energy capabilities, including solar and wind energy production at the ports. The private sector is poised to play a pivotal role in this transformation by providing services and equipment in support of port operations and the greening initiative.

In line with these sustainability goals, the global shipping sector is embracing carbon emissions reduction strategies, including the adoption of advanced technologies such as green methanol-fuelled cargo ships and electric tugboats. Furthermore, electric gantry cranes, terminal tractors, and other container-moving equipment are set to replace high-emission diesel versions to reduce port operators’ carbon footprint.

The US Government’s support for Sri Lanka’s ports sector is robust and expanding, the largest contribution being a US International Development Finance Corporation investment of $ 553 million supporting the development of the West Container Terminal. In addition, the US Embassy is facilitating capacity building programs for SLPA staff in the fields of cyber security, public-private partnerships, operational management, and human resources as it manages expanding port operations in Colombo and across the country.

The US Government’s ongoing support for the ports sector through the US Departments of State, Energy and Defense provides a boost to Sri Lanka’s economy while facilitating supply chain resilience for global trade.

The event will be held at the Courtyard by Marriot and will include speakers from the diplomatic community, Sri Lankan and Maldivian Government representatives and private sector industry leaders from the ports, shipping, and logistics sectors. The key presenter will be from the Netherlands-based RebelGroup. Event logistics will be provided by CIMC Events Ltd.
