Sri Lanka to export chilli, eggplant, okra and maize seeds: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is preparing to export several types of seeds after research proved successful, its Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industry, Mahinda Amaraweera has said.

“For the first time, several species of chillies, eggplant, okra and maize have been successfully tested. There is a high demand for these seeds from many foreign countries,” Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said on his social media page.

The Department of Agriculture and the private sector have conducted research on these new types of seeds, he said during a visit to the CIC Holdings’ Palvehera farm.

“More suitable seeds are being produced for cultivation in our country. The MICH 1-2 chilli variety introduced by the Department of Agriculture is currently yielding very successful harvests across the country. It is possible to get crops for 9 consecutive months from that chili cultivation.”

Sri Lanka imports seeds for various crops from foreign countries.

The minister said that based on the success of research conducted on vegetable crops, including maize and fruits, it would be possible to stop the import of seeds to Sri Lanka in the future.

“Due to this, the prices of seeds will reduce by 50 percent.” (Colombo/Apr8/2024)
