Sri Lanka to reward public sector officials who did not strike

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will grant a special pay increment to non-executive government officials who reported for duty on July 8 and 9, despite an ongoing trade union action.

They will also be issued a commendation certificate for future promotions, the president’s media division said.

“Non-executive government employees, who reported for duty on July 8 and 9, 2024, will be granted a special salary increment as a token of appreciation for their dedication during a challenging economic period.”

President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s proposal to the Cabinet on the above was approved by the Cabinet today.

Parts of the country’s public sector went on strike, or reported sick, yesterday and today causing immense inconvenience to people.

The government earlier this year provided a monthly allowance of 10,000 rupees to all public servants.

The country will need an extra 275 billion rupees to give 20,000 rupee salary hike to state workers, requiring value added tax to be raised by 4 percent, State Minister for Finance Shehan Semasinghe said. (Colombo/Jul9/2024)
