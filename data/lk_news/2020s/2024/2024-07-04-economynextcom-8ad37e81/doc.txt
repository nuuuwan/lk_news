Sri Lanka’s Colombo Port, US Virginia Port to collaborate

ECONOMYNEXT – The Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and the Virginia Ports Authority (VPA) in the United States of America, have agreed to exchange expertise and technical collaboration between the Colombo and Virginia ports.

The Port of Virginia is a major international gateway for US trade and runs an automated SMART port.

The agreement covers 10 articles; information and knowledge sharing, exchange visits, sharing best practices, cooperation on general logistics, exchange of technical expertise, supporting initiatives in maritime security, liaising between parties, dispute settlement and entry into force, validity and renewal, and termination.

The memorandum of cooperation (MOC) was agreed upon on May 15 in Portsmouth, VA when an SLPA delegation visited the United States on a study tour through The Colombo Plan.

It came into effect with the approval by the cabinet of ministers in Sri Lanka on June 19, and has a validity period of five years.

The US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung lauded the port agreement between Sri Lanka and Virginia ports authorities: “Sri Lanka has a vital role to play in facilitating global trade and ensuring the world’s cargo efficiently traverses the Indian Ocean.

“This agreement is a testament to the shared vision of both our nations to bolster maritime security, enhance logistical efficiency, and drive economic growth. The United States recognizes the importance of a robust and resilient maritime sector in Sri Lanka and is dedicated to providing ongoing support and cooperation.”

SLPA Chairman Keith Bernard and General Council for VPA Sarah J McCoy signed the MoC on behalf of each organisation. (Colombo/Jul4/2024)
