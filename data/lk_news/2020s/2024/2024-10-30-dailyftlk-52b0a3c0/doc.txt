OQ Trading gets contract to supply LPG for Litro in 2025

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved awarding the contract to OQ Trading Ltd., for the supply of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) to Litro Gas Lanka Ltd., in 2025.

Speaking during the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Vijitha Herath stated that tenders had been invited under the single stage double lot system following the international competitive bidding system for the supply of LPG to Litro Gas Lanka Limited for the year 2025.

“Only two suppliers, namely, Siam Gas Trading Pte Ltd., and OQ Trading Ltd., had submitted bids for this purpose, while the bid submitted by Siam Gas Trading was rejected,” he said.

The decision was made based on the recommendations of the Standing Procurement Committees appointed by the Cabinet, recognising OQ Trading Ltd., as the substantially responsive bidder.
