Three Parliament staffers arrested over sexual abuse allegations

Three junior staff members employed at the Parliament were arrested by the Police yesterday in connection to allegations of abusing and harassing two female staffers in the housekeeping department of the institution.

The arrests were carried out by investigators from the Sri Lanka Police Bureau for the Prevention of Abuse of Children and Women. This action followed the internal inquiry conducted by a committee led by Secretary General of Parliament Kushani Anusha Rohanadeera, who subsequently informed Acting IGP Deshabandu Tennekoon about their findings based on the advice received from the Attorney General. Following directives from the Acting IGP, the Bureau had investigated the incident. Subsequently, the two initial suspects were arrested, and based on statements obtained from them, a third suspect was also apprehended. The trio was brought before the Kaduwela Magistrates Court yesterday.

In August 2023, a three-member committee took action by interdicting two implicated staff members and launching an internal investigation into allegations of sexual abuse involving female employees of the parliamentâ€™s Catering and Housekeeping Department.

The committee was set up in response to a query raised by Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Rohini Kumari Wijerathna during a parliamentary session in August last year. At the time, the MP requested the Secretary General of Parliament to conduct an impartial investigation over the complaints made by female employees attached to the Housekeeping Department of Parliament of allegations of sexual abuse and harassment by senior officials.

She said severe punishment should be given to responsible parties since it is reported that some senior officials are trying to cover up the sexual harassment of some female employees in the Parliamentary Housekeeping Department.

MP Wijerathna said victimised female employees have been forced by the senior officials who were involved in the incidents, to give written assurances that such abuse or assaults had not taken place.
