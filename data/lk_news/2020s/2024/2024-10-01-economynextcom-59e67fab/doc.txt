Policy decision on SriLankan Airlines restructure to be taken after elections

ECONOMYNEXT  – No decision on the restructure of state-run SriLankan Airlines will be taken until after elections bring a new government to office, Minister Vijitha Herath said.

“In this interim period we will not go for any policy related decisions,” Minister Herath told reporters at weekly post-cabinet press briefing.

“In a future government, which we will build soon, we will go for some actions. At the moment, in this short period we will not go for policy decisions.”

Sri Lanka sought a buyer for a stake sale of SriLankan Airlines but nothing was finalized, the current sale process was dropped amid weak interest.

However SriLankan has debt, including a government guaranteed bond, that has to be resolved. (Colombo/Oct01/2024)
