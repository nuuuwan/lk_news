Those who donâ€™t like development call Elon Musk an economic hitman: Manusha

Colombo, June 1 (Daily Mirror) - Those who dislike seeing progress achieved by the underprivileged have labelled entrepreneurs like Elon Musk as "economic hitmen", Labour and Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara said at a meeting held in Badulla.

"Elon Musk is the number one billionaire in the world. Tesla, SpaceX, eBay, Bitcoin and Starlink Satellite are all under his leadership. He has informed the President that he will start a Tesla branch in Sri Lanka.

"Elon Musk is a powerful entrepreneur who brought technology to the world and is someone from whom we can learn about life. Despite not having a university education, his actions have made a significant impact globally," he said.

Yesterday, I saw NPP Economic Council member Sunil Hadunnetti call Elon Musk an 'economic hitman.' This is not true. Elon Musk is a man who changed the world economy and propelled it forward.

"When someone like him comes to Sri Lanka, the country's technology will be integrated with the world. With the connection to the Starlink satellite, you can work from anywhere with internet access. People from all over the world can come and work in Sri Lanka. We should be happy about this," the Minister said.
