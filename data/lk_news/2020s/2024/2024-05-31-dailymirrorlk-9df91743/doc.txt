Families of disappeared against freeing Ex-Navy Chief

Colombo, May 31 (Daily Mirror) - The Families of the Disappeared with the parents staged a protest against the attempt to free former Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda  from the Trial-at-Bar relating to the disappearance of 11 youths by a group of Navy officers.

The protest was organised by the human rights organisation, the Families of the Disappeared in front of the Superior Courts Complex at Hulftsdorp ahead of the hearing of the writ application filed by ex-Navy chief Karannagoda scheduled to be taken up on June 3 before the Court of Appeal.

In 2019, the Attorney General filed indictments with over 667 charges against the 14 accused including Karannagoda in connection with the torture, extortion, abduction and conspiracy to murder 11 youths during the years 2008-2009. Due to the seriousness of the crime, a special Trial-at-Bar comprising three High Court judges was appointed to try the case.

In March 2020 the former Navy Commander filed a writ application and sought an interim injunction suspending the trial against him and others until his petition is heard and to release from charges.

Brito Fernando, President of the Families of the Disappeared complained after conducting investigations and filling charges now there are attempts by the Attorney General to withdraw charges against the former Navy Commander.

“We are trying our best to stop the AG from withdrawing the charges against the 14th accused, Ex Navy Chief Wasantha Karannagoda. During the past 1year and 7 months the same AG Department fought strongly demanding against the appeals made by the ex-Navy Chief requesting to release him of these charges,”  Fernando said.

“We strongly believe, this is nothing other than the political influence the 14th accused has over the governments. We are not demanding to treat the accused in the same way they did to our children and loved ones. We are just asking the law to take the necessary action in this case.

So the role of the AG is suspicious. He is the only authority standing for our rights in the prevailing legal system,” the human rights defender stated.

The human rights organisation is to continue the protest today and on June 3 demanding justice for the children who were abducted and murdered.
