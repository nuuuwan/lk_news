SJB General Secretary slams dissident

Colombo, April 30 (Daily Mirror) - Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara today hit out at the party's Organizer Gamini Vijith Vijithamuni Soysa who has been critical of the party leadership lately.

Former MP Soysa was reported to have complained that he has been sidelined by the SJB leadership.

“Soysa was given the Katana organider’s post but he has proven to be a failure. He has been a failure in Moneragala as well,” he added.

Meanwhile, Bandara expressed his uncertainty on the participation of SJB Chairman Sarath Fonseka at its May Day rally tomorrow.

“Field Marshal Fonseka might participate in our rally and the procession. However, don’t talk about him now,” he told journalists.
