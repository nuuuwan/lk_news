SL diplomats to meet Russian Defence Ministry today

Colombo, May 30 (Daily Mirror) Sri Lankan diplomats in Russia will engage with officials of the Russian Defence Ministry this evening, in "first steps" towards repatriating Sri Lankans in Russia, who have been thrust into the battlefront of its war against Ukraine.

The Foreign Ministry has received up to 455 complaints of Sri Lankans who are part of Russia's military efforts, willingly or unwillingly, but this number could be much higher, State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya said.

While some of them had travelled as mercenaries, the State Minister said that others were duped into fighting for Russia at the battle front.

“The people who have gone to Russia, have gone through different means. Most have gone through visit visas, and they have gone through India or the Middle East, and they have been duped by various nefarious agents, some of whom have been arrested,” State Minister Balasuriya said.

“Some of those who travelled to Russia said that they would not be used for any fighting, but we have reports that they have been put to the front,” the State Minister added, though contending that there may be a number of them who would not want to return to the island.

“26 people were repatriated after coming to the Sri Lankan embassy in Russia, while 16 have been reported missing,” State Minister Balasuriya added.

As a first step towards resolving this matter, the Russian Defence Ministry would meet Sri Lankan diplomats later today.

“Today in Moscow, there will be a meeting in the Defence Ministry, between (Sri Lanka’s) diplomatic mission and defence attaché, with high ranking military officials. That would be the first step, in the continuous efforts to settle the situation,” Russian Ambassador to Sri Lanka Levan Dzhagaryan said, at the media conference at the Foreign Ministry today.
