Presidential pardons: an unchecked executive power

A pardon is defined in Black’s Law Dictionary ‘as an act of grace’. In the Oxford Dictionary it is defined as an “action of forgiving or remission of the legal consequences of an offence or conviction”. Some argue that the power to grant a pardon is a check on the powers of the judiciary rectifying any miscarriage of justice. But this executive power unchecked could result in the abuse of power.

In recent times, President Sirisena granted two pardons – one within six months and the other within nine days of relinquishing office while President Gotabay Rajapaksa granted two pardons – one within four months of becoming president and the other seven months after he received a two thirds majority in Parliament.

The practice of giving Presidential pardons to political friends came to the limelight when President Gotabaya Rajapaksa appointed a notorious Buddhist monk Ven. Galaboda Eththe Gnanasara who had received a pardon from President Sirisena earlier, as the Head of the Presidential Task Force to study and prepare a law to implement the concept “One Country One Law”, as though the monk was an epitome of righteousness.

In view of the controversial manner in which Presidents Maithripala Sirisena and Gotabaya Rajapaksa had granted pardons, the proposals to tighten presidential prerogative in granting pardons was a strident demand during the course of the recent Aragalaya. However, the course of action provided in the 19th amendment for the Supreme Court to review pardons by way of Fundamental Rights applications, has become a positive feature in the hands of our independent Supreme Court which has maintained checks and balances on the executive power thereby preventing a culture of injustice undermining the Rule of Law.

Some murders highlight brutality and arrogance of the accused when committing crimes. Such acts bring immense agony, pain and suffering to the victims and their loved ones. That is why a president is expected to intervene with utmost care when using his prerogative to grant a pardon. In doing so, he is obliged to consider the gravity of the offence, the role of the police in containing crime, the specific role of the AGs department and the judiciary in imparting justice and not be arbitrary, unreasonable and ignore the public interest.

In Britain, the courts have jurisdiction to review the exercise of the Royal Prerogative of the Monarch to grant a pardon “in accordance with accepted public Law principles”. In India too, the Indian Supreme Court has held that in a landmark judgement in Epuru Sudhakar and Another vs Government of Andhra Pradesh , that the Indian Supreme Court has the jurisdiction to review presidential pardons.

The request for a pardon is generally forwarded by the Prisons Department based on good behaviour, age and medical condition etc. Of the prisoner. Therefore it plays a leading role in deciding on a convict’s life in prison. Also, the prisoner himself can appeal for a pardon.

Article 34 (1) of the Constitution, while stating that the President may in the case of any offender convicted by any court (a) grant a pardon either free or subject to lawful conditions, (b) grant any respite for an indefinite period, of the execution of any sentence, (c) substitute a less severe form of punishment imposed on the offender or (d) remit the whole or any part of the punishment imposed, has incorporated a Proviso to the Article 34 which states that : ‘where the offender has been condemned to death, the President shall call for the report from the Judge who tried him and shall forward that report for AG’s advice and thereafter the President shall submit all to the Minister of Justice, who shall forward the report with his recommendations to the President.’

Presidential pardons are a regular feature in cases where prisoners are convicted of minor offences. Such pardons are granted marking special events like Vesak, Christmas and Independence Day. In such cases of non-murder offences, pardons are given mainly during national festivals. According to statistics available in the Ministry of Justice, Presidents J R Jayewardene, R Premadasa, D B Wijetunga released 72 convicts during 1978 to 1994. The first President J R Jayewardene pardoned gangster Gonawela Sunil in 1983 convicted for raping a 14-year-old girl in 1982. On that occasion, The President of the BASL, A C (Bunty) de Zoysa protested strongly. Zoysa was a working Committee member of the UNP at the time but had the guts to clash with his party leader. However, his protests were ignored.

This rapist gangster is alleged to have executed a plan to massacre 53 Tamil Prisoners in 1983. ( N Jordan, Retd Deputy Prisons Chief- CDN, 16 Nov. 1999 ). President Premadasa pardoned Manori Daniels, a teacher in a government school in the Batticaloa District and a mother of two, who was convicted of aiding and abetting the LTTE bomber Gagendran who caused the death of 40 civilians in a car bomb blast in Maradana, on November 9. 1987. She was given a six year sentence in October 1989. (President Premadasa expected the LTTE to reciprocate his goodwill. But as history has recorded, LTTE never reciprocated gestures of goodwill shown by either Presidents Ranasinghe Premadasa or subsequently Mahinda Rajapaksa).

President Mahinda Rajapaksa pardoned 10 former members of the Presidential Security Division ( PSD ) who were sentenced for over four years after they were found guilty of assaulting and causing bodily harm to a famous husband wife duo because they sang at an opposition political party musical show.

In murder convictions, the presiding judge always files a report. This report is available to the President and to the Committee sitting on the future of such convicts. If a presidential pardon is granted to a murder convict in death row, in most instances the death sentence is reduced to life imprisonment.

“Life sentence” means 20 years. From time to time, the term gets reduced due to good behaviour, age, medical condition etc. Finally, the prisoner is sent home before the reduced term is reached but under a supervisory licence and required to be of good behaviour.

During President Chandrika Kumaratunga’s presidency, a policy was formulated and is being followed today where a committee comprising of a retired judge as chairman, an official from the AG’s and Prisons Departments, Ministry of Justice and a psychologist sit in committee to decide on the future of a prisoner on whom a death sentence is passed. The committee decisions are made on a case-by-case basis.

But with time, unchecked presidential power began to corrupt, resulting in abuse of power. It expanded to instances where murderers were pardoned with impunity.

In the first of such cases was President Mahinda Rajapaks  pardoning in March 2009, Mary Juliet Monica Fernando (a minister’s wife) convicted of a double murder in 2005. In view of the controversies surrounding the impunity with which President Mahinda Rajapaksa used his Executive powers in general, the Yahapalanaya government enacted the 19th amendment, in which provision was made for the Supreme Court jurisdiction to review the official decisions of a President by way of a Fundamental Rights application under Article 35 (1) of the Constitution. As a result, a way to check presidential excesses was made available to the people, thereby upholding the doctrine of “Separation of Powers” in the Constitution.

Despite the enactment of the said 19th Amendment by his own government, President Sirisena granted pardons to: (1) controversial Buddhist monk and Secretary General of the militant Bodu Bala Sena in May 2019. He had been sentenced to six years for contempt of court after failing in his appeal to the Court of Appeal in August 2019. This pardon was granted a mere six months before Sirisena relinquished office.

(2) to Jude Anthony Jayamaha on November 9, 2019, a mere nine days before he relinquished office despite the Supreme Court having dismissed Jayamah’s appeal confirming the death sentence.

In the face of severe criticism, a press release from the president’s office on November 11, 2019 stated that Ven Athuraliya Rathana Thero moved in the matter in writing and made verbal representation with Ven Baddegama Samitha Thero, Ven Karandawela Punnaratana Thero, Ven Balangoda Buddhagosha Thero and Catholic Bishop Raymond Wickramasinghe. They appealed to the President to pardon Jayamaha. Many allegations were made about large sums of money being paid to various persons for the services rendered but, astonishingly no formal inquiry was made to find out the truth about these allegations made by the president’s media division, although some of those named were MPs.

Aggrieved by the presidential pardon, a F R application was filed by ‘The Women and Media Collective’ challenging the use of the president’s constitutional power to grant a pardon as he does not have the freedom to grossly violate the Rule of Law, equity and rationality and has no right to recklessly disregard the sensitivities and sensibilities of the aggrieved family from whom a young life was taken away in a gruesome murder. When the case was taken for hearing, the court was informed by the Controller of Immigration and Emigration that after Jayamaha was granted the pardon, he had travelled overseas and is not to be found. The SC ordered overseas travel ban until further consideration.

A three-member Bench delivering the judgement found President Sirisena had intentionally violated the constitution and ordered him to pay Rs 1 m each to the parents of the victim and Rs 1 m to the petitioner and directed the AG to take tangible measures to secure the custody of the Jayamaha.

Despite mud in the face of the outgoing President Sirisena, the newly elected President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, also misused his constitutional privilege. Armed with a massive 6.9m voter mandate, he gave two pardons: (1) to an Army Sergeant Sunil Ratnayake on March 26, 2020 – a mere four  months after he assumed office despite a five Judge Bench of the Supreme Court affirming on April 25, 2019 the death sentence and (2) to former Parliamentarian Duminda Silva on June 24, 2021- a mere seven months after receiving a two thirds majority in Parliament.

It is heartening to observe that the Supreme Court has asserted its authority by judicially checking the presidential prerogative to grant pardons. It has already issued an interim order, nullifying the presidential pardon granted to Duminda Silva and fixed September 4 to hear the FR case challenging the pardon given to former soldier Sunil Ratnayake.

In the case of Duminda Silva, The Colombo High Court imprisoned this controversial parliamentarian for life in 2016 over the murder of MP Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa appointed a highly controversial Presidential Commission to investigate incidents of political victimization which recommended the release of Duminda Silva. The President promptly granted a special pardon to Duminda Silva in June 2021. But in May 2022, the SC issued an interim order directing the CID to place Duminda Silva under prison custody and impound his passport.

One of the most obnoxious and controversial acts of President Gotabaya Rajapakse was to grant Lance Corporal Suni Ratnayake a pardon for the murder of eight Tamil civilians in December 2000. This act of the president after the war victory and at a time the country required reconciliation to rebuild the country’s economy after a 30 year war and reconcile and integrate the Tamil community was not expected of a Head of a State and was a stab in the back of reconciliation.

Fortunately, The SC has granted leave to appeal in five FR cases filed by the family members of the victims and the Centre for Policy Alternatives, challenging the former President’s decision to pardon former soldier and directed service of notices on the former president and Ratnayake to be present at the hearing in September 2024, as both were unrepresented in court.

The people should recall the facts of this heinous crime and the court verdict, to understand the gravity of the crime committed on so many innocent lives. Lance Corporal Sunil Ratnayake, with a 20 strong military unit of the Gajaba Regiment was airlifed to Mirusavil, Jaffna, on December 18, 2000. The murder of eight villagers took place just one day later on December 19, 2000.

He was sentenced to death by a High Court Trial at Bar in June 2015 after almost 15 months since the date of the crime. A five judge Bench sitting in appeal in the Supreme Court affirmed the sentence on April 25, 2019. The court held that the prosecution had established all eight counts of murder (11-18) and count of causing hurt to Maheswaran ( 19 ) and confirmed the death sentence.

Briefly the facts are as follows: When the fighting intensified in 2000 and the LTTE overran Elephant Pass in April 2000, the army retreated to Ellathumaduwal and the villagers dispersed from their village Mirusavil to close by villages due to stray shells falling nearby. But the villagers developed the habit of visiting their homes in Mirusavil to clean their houses and collect whatever produce they can and return before dusk.

On December 18, 2000, a military unit of the Gajaba Regiment was airlifted to Mirusavil. On December 19, eight villagers comprising a five-year-old toddler accompanying his father, two 13- and 15-year-old boys accompanying their fathers visited their homes on cycles, as villagers used to do.

On this fateful day at about 4 pm, when the eight villagers were getting ready to return with whatever produce they had collected, the five-year-old had pestered the father to pluck a guava fruit from a nearby tree. The father not having the heart to disappoint his son, had with the others on their cycles, gone towards the fruit tree. But they were confronted on the way by two soldiers – one with a firearm and the other with a knife. After an initial questioning, one soldier went back and returned with four other military men who together had severely assaulted all the men with blunt weapons. When witness Maheswaran (only surviving witness) regained consciousness, they blindfolded him with his sarong and threw him over a fence. His sarong was entangled on the fence and he lay injured in his underwear.

Subsequent events narrated by Maheswaran, disclosed how he escaped not knowing the fate of the others and met his father who was searching for him. His mother to whom the story was related, had complained to the political office of the EPDP. Subsequently he was admitted to the Chandigar hospital. On information and pressure, the army authorities promptly started investigating the incident.

During the search of the area by the Military Police with Maheswaran, a few soldiers accompanied by Officer Commanding the unit Sgt Ranasinghe stationed about 50 meters away from the scene of the crime, had approached the search party. Seeing them Maheswaran had spontaneously cried out pointing at two soldiers as the two who had severely beaten them up. They were Lance Corporal Ratnayake and Private Kumarasinghe.

Subsequently at a Magisterial inquiry, five persons were identified among whom were the first accused appellant Ratnayake and Kumarasinghe. On court orders, a search revealed the bodies and the bicycles of all the eight unfortunate civilians killed and buried at a spot shown by Ratnayake – the accused appellant. The relatives had identified the bodies.

They were charged for unlawful assembly and murder and causing hurt to the only eyewitness Maheswaran and deceased Raviwarnam.

The entire case was based on circumstantial evidence and lay on the credibility of the evidence of the only eye witness, Maheswaran. The court had observed that the witness was traumatized and had even refused to go with the army to identify places if not accompanied by EPDP and ICRC officials.

Medical evidence confirmed the assault to be compatible with Maheswaran’s testimony. The doctor who did the post mortem examination stated that all bodies had injuries by assault and cut injuries around the back of either side of the neck, which severed the two main arteries and were necessarily fatal. The prosecution had contended that no firearms were used in murdering, as the killers were aware of the war situation in the area and took precautions not to make a noise by firing.

The defence argued that Maheswaran’s evidence had contradictions and omissions. But both courts held that they were all minor and insignificant. The SC further observed that the witness was a Tamil with no knowledge of Sinhala. His evidence was translated into Sinhala writing and some discrepancies may have occurred.

The SC commented that in his dock statement the accused appellant had admitted that he was present in the area on this fateful day. The SC having considered the totality of all the evidence, circumstantial and otherwise, came to the conclusion that: (1) there was irresistible inference that it was appellant and his group of men that had inflicted the fatal injuries to all deceased and (2) from the nature of injuries, it was safe to conclude that the injuries were inflicted with an intention to cause death.

It is hoped that the agitation launched by civil society will succeed and ensure that the process of granting a pardon by the Head of State will be strengthened by unambiguous constitutional and legal provisions, so that such a privilege is retained but not abused for collateral reasons.
