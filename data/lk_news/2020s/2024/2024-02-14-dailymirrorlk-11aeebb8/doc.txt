5G Technology remains uncertain in Sri Lanka

Colombo, Feb 14 (Daily Mirror) - The timelines for the commercial launch of 5G technology remains uncertain over the high cost involved in infrastructure building and securing devices, a source from the Technology Ministry said.

The auction for 5G spectrum is still ongoing, creating uncertainty for operators. However, the source said the government and telecom operators remain committed to launching 5G technology commercially.

“Building the necessary infrastructure across the country requires significant investment. The cost of 5G-compatible devices and data plans might be initially high for many users,” the source said.

According to the source, the successful implementation could benefit Sri Lanka's economy by attracting investments, fostering innovation, and boosting digital access.

The 5G technology in Sri Lanka is still in its early stages, while there have been promising developments and trials. Sri Lanka became the first South Asian nation to successfully test a 5G network. Last year, Dialog Axiata and Mobitel launched limited-scale 5G trial zones in Colombo, Kandy, Jaffna, Anuradhapura and Galle. Sri Lanka Telecom is reportedly conducting internal trials.
