Mendis and Fernando join T20 World Cup squad in USA after visa delay

Colombo, May 24 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka’s top-order batsman and wicketkeeper Kusal Mendis, along with fast bowler Asitha Fernando, have joined the national T20 World Cup team in the USA after a delay in receiving their visas, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Selection Committee Chairman Upul Tharanga told the Daily Mirror.

Although the national team departed for the USA on May 14, Mendis and Fernando could not travel with the team due to their visas not being issued by the US Embassy in Sri Lanka.

The 15-member Sri Lanka team left for the USA in advance to train and acclimatize to the conditions. They arrived in the USA last Wednesday and began training at the Morrisville Facility in North Carolina.

Tharanga expressed relief that the team arrived in the US two weeks in advance, allowing the players to familiarize themselves with the conditions. He confirmed that all players are fit for the upcoming warm-up games.

He said that the pitches in the USA are slow, which will be challenging for the batters.

Sri Lanka is set to play two warm-up games ahead of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024, starting on May 28. They will take on the Netherlands in their first warm-up game on May 28 at Broward County Stadium in Florida. In their second warm-up game, Sri Lanka will face Ireland on May 31 at the same venue.
