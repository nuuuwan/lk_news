Lumala makes debut at International Industry Expo 2024

In its pursuit to enhance environmental health and inspire an active lifestyle throughout the Sri Lankan community, City Cycle Industries Manufacturing Ltd., also known as Lumala, recently participated at the International Industry Expo 2024, organised by the Ministry of Industries (MOI) and the Industrial Development Board (IDB).

One of the most sought after events in the country, the International Industry Expo 2024, held from 19 to 23 June at the BMICH, brought together tens of hundreds of exhibitors from diverse industry sectors, showcasing their products and innovations to visitors from over 20 countries.

Lumala had a highly successful debut at the expo, making strides in bringing some of the most environmental-friendly, cost-efficient, smart mobility solutions as opposed to the conventional ones. For instance, their Voltage Edition e-bikes can go more than 100 km with pedal assistance on a single charge, and more than 60 km when fully charged and going at full power.

Their Eco Hauler, an e-bike cart designed to tackle the urgent waste management issues in Sri Lanka in collaboration with the USAID Clean Cities, Blue Ocean (CCBO) program, is contributing significantly to combatting plastic pollution and boosting waste collection efficiency alongside riverbanks in both urban and coastal areas.

Such innovation is no stranger to Lumala, where its talented team of R&D professionals work towards their commitment to environmental sustainability, paving the way for a cleaner, greener planet.

Lumala also went on to display their range of customised e-cycles in the parade that was held on 18 June. The parade featured various assembled or manufactured automobiles that are proudly made in Sri Lanka. This was organised by the IDB, MOI, Sri Lanka Automotive Component Manufacturers Association (SLACMA), and the Automobile Assemblers Association.

The parade was held for the third time, where over 200 diverse types of vehicles toured through Galle Face, the Lotus Roundabout, Fort, Technical Junction, Panchikawatta, Maradana, Borella, Borella Cemetery Junction, and BMICH. Joining Lumala in the parade was Dushyanth Weeraman, the popular singer and brother of one of the pop duo BNS, who is also an enthusiastic cyclist.

Continuing on its path of innovation, Lumala is devoted to developing eco-friendly solutions that support the broader agenda of global sustainability. This dedication firmly establishes Lumalaâ€™s leadership in the realm of smart mobility.
