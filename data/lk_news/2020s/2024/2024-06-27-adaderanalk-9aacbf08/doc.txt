Two SC judges recuse themselves from Diana Gamage contempt petition

Two Supreme Court judges have recused themselves from considering the contempt of court petition filed against former State Minister Diana Gamage.

The petition, filed by the former chairman of the Weligama Urban Council Rehan Jayawickrema, alleges that Gamage is guilty of contempt for the comments made by her during a press conference following the Supreme Courtâ€™s judgment disqualifying her from holding the position of a Member of Parliament.

The petition was taken up before a three-member Supreme Court bench comprising Justices Preethi Padman Surasena, Kumuduni Wickremasinghe, and Janak De Silva yesterday (26).

However, Justices Janak De Silva and Kumuduni Wickremasinghe had announced their decision to recuse themselves from the case.

The Supreme Court has then ordered for the petition to be recalled on August 05.
