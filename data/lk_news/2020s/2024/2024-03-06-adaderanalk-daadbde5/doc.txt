Suspended end-of-term school tests in WP resume today

The Grade 10 and 11 end-of-term tests of the government schools in the Western Province, which were suspended after exam papers were found to have been leaked, have been resumed.

Accordingly, the students will sit for the rest of the test papers starting today (March 06).

The exam was suspended last week after the Science, English and Mathematics papers for Grades 10 and 11 were leaked to social media platforms prior to the scheduled test dates.

The three subjects that were cancelled are slated to be held after preparing new test papers, the Western Provincial Education Department mentioned.

Meanwhile, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has initiated an investigation after a complaint was filed on the matter.
