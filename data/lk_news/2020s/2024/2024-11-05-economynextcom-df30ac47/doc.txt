US election gets under way

ECONOMYNEXT â€“ The US presidential election got underway as Americans headed to the polls to choose between current Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.

Democratic nominee Harris and Republican nominee Trump each need at least 270 electoral votes, a majority of the total 538 Electoral College votes, to win.

The battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are expected to be pivotal, CNN reported.

Both tied with three votes each in the tiny New Hampshire community of Dixville Notch, which opened and closed its poll just after midnight ET in a decades-old tradition, CNN said. (Colombo/Nov5/2024)
