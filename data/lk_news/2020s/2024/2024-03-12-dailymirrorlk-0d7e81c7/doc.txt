SJB to seek nutrition package from IMF next week: Sajith

Colombo, March 12 (Daily Mirror)- Whilst revealing that the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) will meet IMF officials next week, Leader of Opposition Sajith Premadasa today said his party will request for IMF assistance for a nutrition package for women and school children.

Premadasa who was speaking during a ceremony held at Malwana MV in Dompe said his party would focus on seeking assistance from IMF to get rid of malnutrition of Sri Lankan women and children.

“A census conducted in the year 2022 has revealed that around 25 percent of Sri Lankan school children are under weight. Also it has been found out that Sri Lankan women do not get sufficient food. This is why we are going to seek a nutrition package from the IMF next week,” Mr. Premadasa said.

“We will also inform IMF to team up with other international financial agencies such as World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) to introduce an assistance package to provide free midday meals for school children,” he added.

He said school children in Sri Lanka are engaged in night time jobs because of their poverty.

“Closure of schools results in opening of 1000 prisons and this is why it is essential to ensure a sound education system in the country,” he also said.
