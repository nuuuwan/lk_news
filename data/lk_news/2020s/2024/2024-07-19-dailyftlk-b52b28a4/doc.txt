Open letter to Education Secretary

As per attachments sent by L.W.K. Silva, Senior Deputy Principal Royal College, there are 49 teachers who should have been transferred out soon after reaching 10 years at Royal College. As I understand, since 2017, the policy of the Ministry has been to transfer out every teacher who has served 10 years at one school. Why is Royal College an exception?

Please have a close look at the list; there are teachers who have completed 23 years to 11 years in this list. What action is being taken to ensure the Ministry follows its own rules in respect of these 49 teachers?

We have observed certain irregularities with regard to money collections at RC. As already informed to you, millions are collected annually without records and receipts. These monies are parked at private bank accounts for months and are never accounted for or audited. Itâ€™s logical to assume that some senior teachers play key roles in such activities. Based on that, we are keen to learn what actions you are going to take and how soon.
