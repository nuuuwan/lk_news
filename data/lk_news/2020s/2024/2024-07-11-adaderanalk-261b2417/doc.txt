Showery conditions to enhance in next few days

The Meteorology Department says showery conditions in the South-western part of the country are expected to be enhanced in the next few days from tomorrow (12 July).

Several spells of showers will occur in Western, Sabaragamuwa and North-western provinces and in Kandy, Nuwara-Eliya, Galle and Matara districts.

Showers or thundershowers may occur at a few places in Eastern and Uva provinces in the evening or night, it said.

Strong winds of about 40-50 kmph can be expected at times over the Western slopes of the central hills, Northern, North-central and North-western provinces and in Trincomalee, Hambantota and Monaragala districts.

The general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
