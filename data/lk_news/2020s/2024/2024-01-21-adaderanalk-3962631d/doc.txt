Controversial monk ‘Vishwa Buddha’ remanded

The saffron-robbed monk claiming to be ‘Vishwa Buddha’ has been ordered to be remanded in custody until January 26, after being produced before the Gangodawila Magistrate’s Court in Nugegoda.

The suspect, who was out on bail, was re-arrested this morning (21) by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID).

Earlier, the monk was arrested on December 12 at a private establishment in Kalagedihena by the cybercrimes unit of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), acting on a complaint received against the self-styled monk who was residing in Ratnapura.

According to police, the saffron-robbed monk had allegedly issued statements demeaning Buddhism.
