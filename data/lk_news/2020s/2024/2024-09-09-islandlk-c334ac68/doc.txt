ApiDenna for Sri Lankans overseas

Piyal and Shenal, who makeup ApiDenna, are now in great demand…overseas, as well.

ApiDenna became a reality because of Ravi De Silva who has a knack of spotting talent that is not run-of-the-mill stuff.

Of course, both Piyal and Shenal are hugely popular…being very much a part of the Gypsies.

As ApiDenna, Piyal and Shenal will be seen in action, in Qatar, this Thursday, 12th September.

They will be performing at an event organised by Doha Titans, called ‘The Scrummage,’ and will be held at Treffen House Hotel.

The following month, October, they will be in London for ‘Autumn Charity Ball 2024’.

Presented by the Sri Lanka Medical and Dental Association UK, it will be held at the Thistle Londom Heathrow on 5th October.

And, with the gypsies, they will be in Ontario, Canada, on 9th November, for a dinner dance
