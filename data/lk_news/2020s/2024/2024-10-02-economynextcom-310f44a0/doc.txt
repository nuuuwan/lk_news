Former state minister urges gov to remain committed to IMF programme

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s former state Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe has urged the new government to stick with the International Monetary Fund programme amidst the steady appreciation of the rupee against the dollar.

“I urge the new administration to remain committed to the IMF programme, which has been instrumental in stabilizing Sri Lanka’s economy,” Semasinghe said on social media platform X.

“Any disruptive decisions could jeopardize the hard-earned progress that is vital for the betterment of our nation.”

Sri Lanka’s rupee was trading stronger at 294.60/75 to the US dollar on Wednesday, after gaining steadily over the week.

“It is great to see that the ambitious reform programme, carried out during the most difficult economic crises, is now bearing fruit,” the former state minister who played an active role in discussions with the global lender said.

“As a result, the selling rate of the US dollar has dropped below Rs. 300 for the first time since June, 2023.”

Sri Lanka’s new president Anura Dissanayake said in his first address to the nation since being elected a week and a half ago that he intends to start talks with the IMF to enhance economic stability and work with creditors.

A team from the IMF will visit Sri Lanka this week and also meet President Dissanayake, Anil Jayantha head of the Economic Council of the President’s National people’s Power party said.

The NPP has said they would seek to revise sections of the program. (Colombo/Oct2/2024)
