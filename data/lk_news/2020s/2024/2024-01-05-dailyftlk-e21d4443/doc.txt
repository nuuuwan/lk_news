The Centre for Cyber Safety and Education, the charitable foundation of ISC2, and ISC2 Colombo Chapter, in collaboration with STEMUP Educational Foundation, have announced a groundbreaking memorandum of understanding (MOU) aimed at enhancing cybersecurity awareness and education among Sri Lankan school students.

This collaborative endeavour also seeks to empower the next generation of cybersecurity professionals by engaging volunteers from universities.

With the rapid expansion of the digital landscape, the need for cybersecurity education and awareness has never been more critical. Sri Lanka, like many nations, faces the constant challenges of cyber threats and vulnerabilities, making it vital to equip the younger generation with the knowledge and skills needed to protect themselves and their future careers in an interconnected world.

1. Cybersecurity workshops for school students: The collaboration will organise workshops and educational events to introduce school students to the fundamentals of cybersecurity. These initiatives aim to raise awareness and cultivate an interest in this vital field from a young age.

2. University volunteer engagement: University students with a passion for cybersecurity have the opportunity to volunteer and contribute to the delivery of educational programs. This hands-on experience would not only bolster their own expertise but also enhance the educational experience for school students.

3. Resource sharing: The three organisations will pool their resources, expertise, and networks to create a comprehensive platform for cybersecurity education and awareness. This includes sharing educational materials, hosting events, and tapping into the collective knowledge of partner organisations.

4. Mentorship and career opportunities: In pursuit of their mission to foster the growth of cybersecurity professionals, ISC2 Colombo Chapter and STEMUP Educational Foundation will offer internship and mentorship opportunities to outstanding university students interested in pursuing careers in cybersecurity.

Centre for Cyber Safety and Education Senior Director Holly Schneider Brown said: “We believe that education is the cornerstone of a safer and more secure cyber environment. By joining forces with ISC2 Colombo Chapter and STEMUP Educational Foundation, we can make a meaningful difference in Sri Lanka’s cybersecurity landscape.”

ISC2 Colombo Chapter President Sujit Christy said: “The global challenge of cybersecurity and the associated skills necessitate attention. Through our collaboration with esteemed organisations, we aim to involve and uplift a diverse pool of future cybersecurity professionals, providing support as individuals advance in their careers in cybersecurity.”

STEMUP Educational Foundation Founder Prabhath Mannapperuma said: “Our focus is on empowering youth through education, and with this collaboration, we are taking a significant step forward in safeguarding the future of our students.”
