Health trade unions’ strike continues for second day straight

The island-wide strike action launched by the collective of health sector trade unions yesterday entered its second consecutive day today (Feb.02).

President of Paramedical Services Front (PMSF) Upul Rohana said a final decision is expected to be taken on proceeding with the strike later today at the discussion planned to be convened with the participation of trade union representatives.

Health workers decided to carry on the trade union action on account of not receiving a favourable response from the government with regard to their demands.

A collective of 72 trade unions from the health sector resorted to a one-day strike across the country last morning (Feb.01), urging the government to address the issues concerning allowances without delay.

The doctors’ unions and the All Ceylon Nurses’ Union, however, decided to refrain from joining the strike action, alleging that the planned strike action was a conspiracy by the government.

In response to the island-wide strike, tri-force personnel were deployed to the state hospitals across the country, depending on the requirements at each facility to ensure uninterrupted provision of essential medical services to the public.

On January 08, the Cabinet of Ministers approved President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s proposal to double the DAT allowance paid to government doctors, raising it from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000.

Since then, the health sector employees’ trade unions representing a wide range of health sector professionals, including radiology and laboratory technicians, pharmacists and drug compounders, midwives, dental surgeons, public health inspectors, and entomology officers launched strikes on multiple occasions in protest of the government’s decision and demanding an allowance increase for all health sector employees.

Later, on January 23, the government decided to temporarily half the payment of DAT allowance for doctors citing insufficient funds. Director General of Health Services Dr. Asela Gunawardena stated that although the necessary arrangements were made for the payment of the said allowance, the Treasury had not provided funds within the approved allocation limit.

This prompted the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) to announce the launch of an indefinite strike action starting January 24. However, it was later called off the planned trade union action, after the decision to suspend the DAT allowance payments was rolled back.
