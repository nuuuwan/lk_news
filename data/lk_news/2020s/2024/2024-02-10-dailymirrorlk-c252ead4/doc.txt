Reduce electricity tariffs by considerable amount: Sajith urges Govt.

Colombo, Feb 10 (Daily Mirror) - Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa yesterday urged the government to reduce the electricity tariff by a considerable amount after analysing the data of the Verité Research and Committee on Public Finance on electricity tariff, which is said to be higher in South Asia.

The Opposition Leader told parliament that, according to the data on the surveys, Sri Lankans pay approximately 2.5 to 3 times more for electricity compared to their counterparts in other South Asian nations.

He said the government increased electricity tariffs on several occasions in the recent past and that it had negatively affected consumers, the public, industrial sector and business sector.

“We heard that the government is planning to reduce electricity tariff by 4 per cent. It is not at all suf­ficient. We urge the government to reduce the electricity tariff by a considerable amount,” he said.
