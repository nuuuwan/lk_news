Sri Lanka President invites Indian firms to privatization

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe has invited Indian firms to invest in state enterprises being re-structured, while further trade and service liberalization between the two countries are planned, a statement from his media office said.

India’s Reliance group has already expressed interest in Sri Lanka Telecom privatization.

Wickremesinghe “welcomed private investments, particularly in infrastructure development and the divestment of state-owned enterprises,” he told a roundtable discussion organized by the Consortium of Indian Industry (CII) at the World Economic Forum Tuesday (16), according to his media division.

Opportunities for potential investors were highlighted in key sectors such as telecommunications, financial services, and energy.

Wickremesinghe and Indian CEOs from various sectors discussed opportunities in supply chain efficiency, healthcare, consumer products, telecom, and clean energy.

Sri Lanka is working with India on renewable energy projects, especially in offshore wind and solar sources, and plans for a high-capacity power grid and bidirectional electricity trade.

The government has considered the use of the Indian rupee for trade settlement. (Colombo/Jan15/2024)
