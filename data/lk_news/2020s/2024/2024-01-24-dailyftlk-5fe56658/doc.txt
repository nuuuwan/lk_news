Temple to temple diplomacy strengthens cultural ties between Sri Lanka and Myanmar

Four distinguished Sri Lankan Buddhist monks undertook a visit to Yangon, Myanmar on 16 January as part of the temple-to-temple diplomacy program launched by the State Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

This visionary initiative was set in motion by State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya, with the blessings of the President and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka. Under the guidance of Ambassador of Sri Lanka to Myanmar Janaka Bandara, the Sri Lankan Embassy in Yangon coordinated with the temples in Myanmar to arrange the visit.

The visiting monks were warmly welcomed by the Pa Thein Monastery in Yangon. During their stay, the Sri Lankan monks will explore temples in Myanmar including the most sacred Swedagon pagoda in Yangon which is said to enshrine relics of the four previous Buddhas.

The temple-to-temple diplomacy program stands as a unique approach to international relations, highlighting the profound cultural and religious ties between nations. This program serves as a bridge towards greater understanding, cooperation, and cultural exchange, fostering regional peace and stability. It is poised to pave the way for enhanced economic collaboration, tourism, and cultural exchanges.Â  The Sri Lankan Embassy is actively collaborating with temples across various states of Myanmar to expand this diplomatic outreach.
