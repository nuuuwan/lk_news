Overstaying Russians and Ukrainians must apply for visa or depart: Alles

Colombo, March 4 (Daily Mirror)- Public Security Minister Tiran Alles said yesterday that Russians and Ukrainians who have been in Sri Lanka since February 2022 will need to apply for a visa or leave the country.

The minister told the Daily Mirror that the free visa facility granted to them will not be extended and they must comply with immigration regulations by applying for fresh visas.

Meanwhile, according to the Tourist Development Authority, an estimated 300 to 400 Russians and Ukrainians have been staying in Sri Lanka since February 2022.

The visa fee is approximately $50 for a 30-day stay in Sri Lanka.

Last week, the Immigration Department released a letter to the Tourism Ministry Secretary requesting him to notify the long term Ukrainian and Russian tourists living in Sri Lanka to leave by March 7.

The circular said that Ukrainians and Russians who were affected by the stoppage of flights to their home countries after the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war were allowed to remain in Sri Lanka since February 28, 2022, a full two years, based on free visa extensions and without the imposition of penalties for expired tourist visas.

The letter further said that although the Russian-Ukraine conflict continues, there are now direct flights between Russia and Sri Lanka, while Ukrainians also have facilities to enter and leave Sri Lanka by air. Therefore, Russian and Ukrainian tourists belonging to the above categories have been given 14 days from 2024/02/23 to 2024/03/07 to leave this country.

The President who was unaware of this circular being released ordered a probe into how such a document could be released without prior cabinet approval and has sought an explanation from the Immigration Chief.

When asked about the letter instructing Russian and Ukrainian tourists to depart the country within 14 days, the minister acknowledged that it was wrong. He said that the directive should have either required them to obtain visas or leave the country.

Meanwhile, when asked whether the project that permitted visa-free entry to visitors from seven countries, including India, China and Russia, would be extended further, the minister expressed that the facility may not be extended.

The pilot project is set to remain in effect until March 31, 2024.
