Chief Prelates have lost faith on President, government: Hirunika

Colombo, Feb 23 (Daily Mirror) - The Malwathu and Asgiri Chief Prelates have lost their faith on President Ranil Wickremesinghe and with the government as they have begun to raise doubts about the elections being held as scheduled, former MP Hirunika Premachandra said.

Premachandra visited the Chief Prelates yesterday to receive blessings for the launch of the first ever women's summit in Kandy.

After the discussion, she told the media that the prelates had no trust in whether or not the government was going to hold the Presidential election.

"Sometimes the government says that they are going to hold a Presidential election, sometimes they talk about a parliamentary election, and sometimes they say that they are going to have a referandum," she said.

"It is clear that the Chief Prelates have no faith on the President, the government, or the procedures conducted by the government. This is a very critical situation. The highest blessing that anyone in this country, including the President, can receive is from the Chief Prelates. If the Chief Prelates are disappointed on the country and the leaders, it is a critical situation," she said.

"I don't think the government or any of the leaders in the country can get those blessings," Hirunika added.
