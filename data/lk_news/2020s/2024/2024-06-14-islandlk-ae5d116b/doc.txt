ComBank donates milestone 300th IT Lab to Nalanda Boys School Minuwangoda

Commercial Bank of Ceylon’s nationally-significant campaign to boost digital literacy in Sri Lanka has reached an impactful milestone with the completion of the 300th IT Lab donation by the Bank.

Commercial Bank Chairman Sharhan Muhseen, Deputy Chairman Raja Senanayake, Managing Director Sanath Manatunge, Chief Financial Officer Nandika Buddhipala and Deputy General Manager Retail Banking & Marketing Hasrath Munasinghe, who are Trustees of the Bank’s Corporate Social Responsibility Trust, led the Bank’s representation at the beneficiary school – Nalanda Boys Central College, Minuwangoda, at this momentous event.

Every IT lab donated by Commercial Bank is equipped with new computers and accessories, and furniture, and is maintained and upgraded by the Bank periodically to ensure that the labs are used by multiple batches of students over many years. The Bank estimates that the IT labs it has donated to schools have already benefitted more than 300,000 students.

Funded as a flagship corporate social responsibility initiative of its CSR Trust, Commercial Bank’s IT education programme is aligned with the country’s Sustainable Development Goals, one of which is to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for everyone.

Commercial Bank’s largest commitment in the sphere of corporate social responsibility is to digital technology education in Sri Lanka. Besides the 300 IT labs donated, the Bank has committed itself to be a key partner in the national Smart Schools initiative where 165 schools have been equipped with digital learning facilities. The Bank has also funded digitized school curriculum content complete with practical videos and presentations to facilitate easy learning for students, donated 170 STEM Classrooms and 120 Math Labs to improve critical thinking of students, supported 3,000 students to get qualified via CISCO Networking Academy and launched a software learning platform in government schools by establishing coding clubs to impart coding ability to students.

In 2023, the Bank launched a new project to promote science education in 50 schools in collaboration with the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Science Branch of the Ministry of Education. The project is one of a series of initiatives supported by the Bank to take science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education to schools across the country.
