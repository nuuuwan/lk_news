Sri Lanka to turn World War II-era Hingurakgoda air base to international airport

ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka plans to revamp the Hingurakgoda airport to an international airport, Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.

The minister said at a discussion that the objective is to turn the Hingurakgoda airport into an airport dedicated to civil aviation.

“The previous budget had allocated 2 billion rupees for this for this year. Until the construction of the airport is complete, from annual budget estimates, the money needed for this will be provided.

“Our final target is like Mattala and Palali to make this a dedicated airport for civil aviation, not domestic but international,” he said.
