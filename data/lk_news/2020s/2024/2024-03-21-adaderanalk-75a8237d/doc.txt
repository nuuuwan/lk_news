Bandulaâ€™s US tour cut short for no-confidence vote against Speaker

Minister Bandula Gunawardena, who was on an official visit to the USA to take part in a conference organized by the World Bank, has returned to the island last night (20), under the directives of President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Following his arrival to the island, Gunawardena clarified that he was called back to the island to participate in crucial vote of the no-confidence motion against the Speaker, which is scheduled to be held this evening (21).

The vote was initially supposed to be held on Wednesday (March 20), however, it was put off by one day as per a decision taken at the Parliamentary Business Committee meeting to debate the no-confidence motion for three consecutive days.
