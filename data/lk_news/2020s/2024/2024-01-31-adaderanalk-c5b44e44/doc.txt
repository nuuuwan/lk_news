Politicians should also have a retirement age – Roshan Ranasinghe

Former Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe has revealed that he intends to step down from politics before the age of 65, and thereby set an example to the country.

Speaking at a public gathering in Nugegoda, the Parliamentarian emphasised that the retirement age limit imposed within the public sector must also be applicable in politics.

“As evidenced in our history, when a governor is around 80 years of age, does he have sound mind to carry out his duties? We will set my political career as an example. I am ready to retire before the age of 65”, Ranasinghe said.
