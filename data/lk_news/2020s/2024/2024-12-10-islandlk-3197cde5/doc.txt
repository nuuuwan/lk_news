Smart measures to combat corruption urgently needed: Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda

The government should adopt smarter preventative measures to combat corruption and protect public resources, urged Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda, a well-respected authority on governance and corruption.

He stressed the importance of proactive reforms in governance and procurement systems, advocating for greater transparency and fairness in public sector dealings.

In thought-provoking comments made while delivering the prestigious S R Kottegoda Oration recently Pethiyagoda, known for his insightful critiques of governance, laid bare the complex, multifaceted nature of corruption that hampers the nation’s progress, stressing the urgent need for systemic reforms to address the issue.

He explained the deep-rooted issues of systemic corruption in Sri Lanka, particularly within the country’s infrastructure projects and regulatory frameworks.

Pethiyagoda began by examining the nature of corruption, which he argued extends far beyond bribery to include monopolistic practices, procurement irregularities and inefficiencies caused by bureaucratic mismanagement.

Pethiyagoda added: ‘A prime example is the longstanding contract between Sri Lankan Airlines and Airbus, a deal that effectively locked the national carrier into an arrangement with limited competition, notably from Boeing. Despite evidence of bribery and the subsequent four-billion-dollar fine levied by the European Union, the Sri Lankan government failed to secure any restitution from the scandal.

‘There are also the dangers posed by monopolies and regulatory malpractices. A case of corruption is the recent agreement with VFS Global—a private company handling electronic travel authorizations. There was an exorbitant fee structure in the deal. As a result, funds meant for Sri Lanka were being siphoned off overseas, further draining the nation’s resources.

Pethiyagoda also scrutinized the country’s procurement systems, particularly pointing out how tenders are often rigged through fixed specifications that favor certain companies. “In technical specifications, minor adjustments can disqualify major manufacturers, essentially ensuring that only the bribing companies win the contract, he explained.

A particularly startling example he raised was the controversial wind power deal awarded to the Adani Group of India. According to Pethiyagoda, the Sri Lankan government paid an inflated price for wind power, which would lead to an additional cost of USD 1.35 billion over 20 years, compared to a much more affordable local tender.

“The government creates regulatory barriers that fuel corruption, he added. “Take the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA), for example. Delays in approving medical equipment parts not only waste resources but cause unnecessary suffering and even deaths.”

Pethiyagoda contended that the failure to tackle corruption lies not only with individual politicians but with the country’s broken systems. He stressed that while political leadership may strive for integrity, these efforts are insufficient unless systemic reforms are introduced. “Corruption cannot be tackled with crime and punishment alone,” he said. “We need to proactively identify and stop corruption before it even occurs.”

Drawing from his own experiences, Pethiyagoda recounted a personal incident during his tenure as a youthful director of biomedical engineering at the Ministry of Health in Sri Lanka. He shared a disturbing example of how radiographers at the National Cancer Institute had misused cobalt radiation therapy machines to irradiate gemstones instead of treating patients, which led to innocent people being misled. Despite a prosecution, the case ultimately fell apart due to legal loopholes, highlighting how corruption in Sri Lanka often slips through the cracks of the legal system.
