Sri Lanka has not blacklisted any contractors, unlike India, Bangladesh, Nepal: report

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has blacklisted zero contractors for engaging in corrupt practices, while other South Asian countries had named hundreds, according to a study by Verité Research, a Colombo-based think tank.

By contrast, Nepal had 629 entries on a public, online database, and Bangladesh had 510.

“Sri Lanka has the worst record among South Asian countries in blacklisting corrupt contractors in public procurement,” a statement by Verité Research said.

Its report shows that “Sri Lanka is the only country in South Asia that 1) does not recognise engaging in corrupt and fraudulent activities during procurement as a valid reason for blacklisting 2) has not blacklisted contractors that have defaulted on contractual obligations despite having the provisions to do so.”

There may be several reasons for the inaction, the report found.

“The first issue can be attributed to gaps in the procurement guidelines of 2006, which govern almost all public procurement in Sri Lanka — except in a few instances such as pharmaceutical procurement.

“The second issue – not blacklisting defaulting contractors – shows a lack of compliance with existing regulations. Sri Lanka has provisions not only to blacklist defaulting contractors, but also to publish their names in a public, online database. However, this database, maintained by the Department of Public Finance, is empty.”

The prevalence of corruption in Sri Lanka’s procurement systems and the importance of fixing these have been highlighted in the civil society governance diagnostic and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) governance diagnostic on the country.

The Verité Research report emphasises the importance of urgently fixing these gaps to combat corruption and restore fiscal governance. (Colombo/Feb19/2024)
