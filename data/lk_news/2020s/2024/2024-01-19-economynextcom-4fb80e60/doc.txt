Sri Lanka adds 300,000 more families to Aswesuma welfare scheme

ECONOMYNEXT: Another 300,00 families have been deemed eligible for the Aswesuma scheme, Sri Lanka’s targeted welfare benefits program, its State Finance Minister said.

“300,000 new families have qualified to receive “Aswesuma” benefits after completion of 640,000 objections and appeals submitted out of 1 million,” Shehan Semasinghe said on X.

“Accordingly, the number of families who will now receive benefit will exceed 1.7 million.”

Semasinghe said that back payments from July to December will be transferred to the bank accounts of the newly selected families “in the near future”.

He pointed out that 5,209 selected beneficiary families had become ineligible and another 2,567 families had moved down from their beneficiary category after reviewing appeals and objections.

50,882 families have moved up in their beneficiary category, he said.

Sri Lanka’s government launched the Awesuma programme last year in response to allegations that the existing welfare scheme system was too politicised, with criticism specifically levelled at the Samurdhi scheme. (Colombo/Jan19/2024)
