Eight Sri Lankans rescued from cyber slave camp in Myanmar – Ambassador

The Sri Lankan Ambassador to Myanmar Janaka Priyantha Bandara says that unverified reports have been received claiming that a group of eight Sri Lankans who were held hostage at a Cyber Slave Camp in Myanmar have been rescued.

In December, reports were rife about a group of Sri Lankans who were lured with tourist visas behind the false front of lucrative job offers in the IT sector and were trafficked to Myanmar through its border with Thailand. These workers had reportedly travelled to Myanmar without registering with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE).

The Sri Lankans forcibly detained at the terrorist camp in Myawaddy – an area infested with cybercrimes under the grip of an armed group – were reported to be working as cyber slaves forced to commit internet scams.
