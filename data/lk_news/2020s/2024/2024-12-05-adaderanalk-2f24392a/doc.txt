SLPP’s Administrative Secretary Renuka Perera arrested

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Administrative Secretary Renuka Perera has been arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) for allegedly posting false information on ‘Mahaviru’ commemorations in the North through social media, police said.

A team of CID officers had visited Renuka Perera’s residence this morning (05) and took him into custody after recording a statement.

Police stated that the CID is conducting further investigations regarding the arrest of Renuka Perera.

Meanwhile, Minister Ananda Wijepala alleged yesterday (04) that photographs from past LTTE ‘Mahaviru’ celebrations that were held in other countries had been circulated on social media, to create the impression that similar events were taking place in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka under the current administration.

The minister also added that two suspects arrested in connection with this matter are activists affiliated with the New Democratic Front (NDF) which contested the general election under the ‘Gas Cylinder’ symbol.
