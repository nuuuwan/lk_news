Sri Lanka’s Justice Ministry goes to Sabry after Wijedasa resignation

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesimghe appointed Foreign Minister Ali Sabry MP as the Justice Minister on Monday (12) after the position fell vacant after the resignation of the former cabinet minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe.

“MP Ali Sabry took oath as the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs & Constitutional Reforms before President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Presidential Secretariat a short while ago in addition to his current portfolio as the Minister of Foreign Affairs,” the President’s Media Division (PMD) said in a statement.

Rajapakshe, the former Justice Minister resigned from his portfolio on July 25 citing that he was contesting in the upcoming presidential poll scheduled for Sept 21.

Rajapakshe has already given his nomination to contest in the poll under National Democratic Front (NDF).

Rajapakshe, 65, has been in parliament for two decades since 2004 representing different political parties, and has held various positions including cabinet portfolios.

Sri Lanka is in the process of enacting some crucial laws including strong anti-corruption laws in line with the commitment the country has committed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Sabry was the Justice Minister under former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa before being appointed as the Finance Minister soon after the economic collapse following the island nation’s unprecedented economic crisis in 2022. (Colombo/Aug 12/2024)
