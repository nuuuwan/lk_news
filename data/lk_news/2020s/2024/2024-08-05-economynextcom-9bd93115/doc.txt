Sri Lanka online tourist visa re-starting decision soon

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Department of Immigration will soon take a decision on providing e-visas after the service provided by IVS-GBS and VFS Global, a private consortium was suspended by court, media reports said.

Sri Lanka’s Aruna newspaper quoted Controller General of Immigration Harsha Illukpitiya as saying that the court order was officially expected to reach him on Monday and a decision will be taken after that.

State-run Dinamina newspaper said the Ministry of Public Security will take a decision on the matter on August 06.

The old website was suspended Friday after Supreme Court decision.

Sri Lanka’s Supreme Court suspended a cabinet decision awarding the online visa contract to the private consortium and asked that the previous status be restored pending the conclusion of several public interest petitions.

The controversial deal was awarded without public tender and led to higher fees being charged for visas on top of government fees.
