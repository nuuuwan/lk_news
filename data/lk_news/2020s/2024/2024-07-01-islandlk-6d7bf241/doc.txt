AI Pazz, the first AI-powered legal research platform in Sri Lanka, transforms the legal industry

In a major transformation shift in the Sri Lankan legal industry, an artificial intelligence (AI) powered legal research platform has been introduced by RedBlocks AI (Pvt) Ltd, featuring the country’s largest legal database, addressing the critical pain points that have long hindered efficient legal research.

At the recently concluded Sri Lanka Association for Software and Services Companies (SLASSCOM) Ingenuity Awards 2024, AI Pazz emerged as a major victor, securing 3rd Best start-up national award and Best Tech for Good national award.

The team behind AI Pazz highlighted that the interest that is shown on the platform and the adaptability of the Sri Lankan legal industry is quite remarkable and encouraging, as many individuals, leading Law chambers and educational institutes have already onboarded within a short period of time.

These accolades highlight the transformative impact AI Pazz is set to have on legal research, promising enhanced efficiency and accuracy for legal professionals across Sri Lanka.

The platform’s recognition at SLASSCOM underscores its potential to revolutionize the legal landscape, setting new standards for innovation and excellence.

Heavy reliance on manual work, hard copies, not having a centralized legal database, and the lack of a mechanism to get the latest updates such as detecting overruled scenarios are some of the biggest challenges legal professionals face every day of their professional work.

With AI Pazz, all levels of legal professionals and law students now get access to a vast range of documents covering up-to-date acts and amendments, case laws from the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, NRL, SLR reports, and many more.

With the power of cutting-edge AI technologies, AI Pazz makes it easy and convenient for its user to search with precision, which saves a lot of time in their day-to-day research tasks.

In addition, legal professionals can now leverage AI-powered virtual assistance to summarize documents, ask questions, and extract information, significantly reducing the time spent on these tasks.

Also, it provides the luxury of offloading the reparative and non-technical tasks such as drafting content to a visual assistant. This makes the submission work and documentation tasks easier than ever.

Parakrama Ratnayake, Co-Founder and Director of RedBlocks AI Pvt Ltd, who is behind AI Pazz, said: “We saw a clear gap in the Sri Lankan legal industry which can be resolved with the AI technology to save a lot of time of our legal professionals. This is just the start of this journey and we have some interesting capabilities in the making which will make it even easier for our legal professionals.”

“Winning these prestigious awards just a few months into our operations is a huge encouragement to the entire team.”

AI Pazz aims to expand its coverage in terms of legal materials, in addition to its product capabilities, over some time, expanding its access to other segments in the market.
