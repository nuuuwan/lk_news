People still fall prey to human trafficking trap in Myanmar: Ali Sabry

Parliament, March 5 (Daily Mirror)- Claiming that people still fall prey to human trafficking in Myanmar despite repeated warnings, Foreign Minister Ali Sabri today warned people not to visit Myanmar on open visas seeking employment.

He told Parliament that three Sri Lankans had left for Myanmar from Dubai through Bangkok last week despite wide publicity and warnings on the Sri Lankans who have become victims of human trafficking and are trapped in Myanmar.

The Minister said Tamil speaking people from Jaffna have been trapped recently as wide publicity had been given only in the Sinhala media and urged the need to give publicity to the incident in the Tamil media as well.

He said the eight Sri Lankans who were rescued were detained by Myanmar police and steps will be taken to repatriate them soon.

He warned people not to visit any country on open visas and said people must emigrate for employment only through SLBF approved agencies.
