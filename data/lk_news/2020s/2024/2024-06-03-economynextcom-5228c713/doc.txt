Sri Lanka is in talks to re-structure bilateral and commercial debt.

Sri Lanka’s foreign debt denominated in currencies like the Yen or French Franc or even SDR may also change in dollar terms due to cross currency movements.

In the first quarter of 2024, Sri Lanka has also collected reserves permitted by deflationary monetary policy.

Frome December to March, gross reserves rose by 480 million US dollars to 4,960 million US dollars, reducing the net debt position.

Up to April, gross official reserves have risen by 980 million dollars to 5,491 million dollars, further helping the net debt position

In addition, the central bank on its own has also been settling IMF and Indian debt, improving the net international reserve position over the past year. However quarterly data is not available.

As long as deflationary policy is maintained (at a market rate), the central bank can collect reserves to repay its swaps.

The government can also exchange rupee cashflows for dollars as long as monetary policy is not inflationary (rates are not cut by liquidity injections).

To repay debt or collect reserves (by appropriating savings of the people) some domestic investment has to be reduced, by maintaining monetary stability at an appropriate interest rate.

Sri Lanka’s total debt including rupee loans and guaranteed state enterprise debt rose by around four billion US dollars to 100.184 billion US dollar equivalent by March from 96,170 billion In December 2024.

Even if foreign debt is repaid on a net basis, domestic debt will rise with the budget deficit.
