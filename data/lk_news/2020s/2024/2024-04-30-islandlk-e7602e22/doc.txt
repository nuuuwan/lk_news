Spell-binding presentation on climate by 14-year-old Lankan

In a remarkable display of knowledge of and enthusiasm for the environment, 14-year-old student Akira Alagiyawanna from Wycherley International School, Colombo, delivered a captivating video address on climate phenomena at the University of California in Los Angeles – UCLA, during an Earth Day event on April 20.

The event, hosted by the America-Sri Lanka Photographic Art Society in Los Angeles, provided a platform for Akira to share his insights with viewers, even from a distance.

During his video address, Akira focused on explaining two important weather patterns: El Niño and La Niña. Using straightforward language and relatable examples, he made these complex topics easy to understand for viewers of all ages. He emphasized the significance of these natural occurrences in shaping global weather patterns, helping viewers grasp their importance in the broader context of climate change.

Akira outlined the origins and impacts of El Niño and La Niña, highlighting their effects on weather, while adding that “these two weather events can also cause panic, since a lot of people think it is related to climate change while it is simply a natural process. In fact we experienced El Niño recently but it is hard to distinguish if there are also other natural phenomena at play such as the Solar Maxima and the Solar Minima which is caused by the 11 year sunspot cycle, therefore you have got to be careful in identifying anthropogenic global warming, because for example this April we experienced some of the hottest days in Sri Lanka due to equator and the Sun being closer than ever on top of El Nino. Our Earth’s patterns are a very broad topic, a complex combination of the matrix of Astrophysics, Solar physics, climatology and many more. This leaves a lot for the new generation to figure out to truly unveil this planetary mystery”.

Despite not being physically present at the event, Akira’s presence was felt strongly through his impactful video address.

His passion for environmental advocacy shone through, motivating viewers to reflect on the ways they can contribute to positive change in their communities and beyond and Akira has proven himself to be a young leader in the fight against climate change, leaving audiences inspired and hopeful for the future.
