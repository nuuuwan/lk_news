Sri Lanka sends tea to Palestine

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs donated a consignment of Ceylon Tea to the people of Palestine in the Gaza Strip as “a token of humanitarian assistance symbolizing Sri Lanka’s unwavering support and solidarity with the people of Palestine,” it said.

“Tea, deeply rooted in our culture, is a gesture of comfort and strength. Sri Lanka extends our support to the people of Palestine, hoping that this contribution brings solace and strength during moments of crisis. Sri Lanka stands in solidarity with Palestine during these difficult times,” State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya said on X.

The donation was received by the Ambassador of Palestine to Sri Lanka, Zuhair Hamdallah Zaid who expressed appreciation for the goodwill gesture.

Colombo-based ambassadors of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Iran as well as diplomats from Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Libya and UAE were also present, the ministry said.
