Decline in three-month TB rate and State Minister’s comments bring CSE to life

The stock market got off to a negative start yesterday but later recovered during the last hour due to a decline in Treasury Bills at the auction and the State Minister of Finance’s revelation of some positive trends in the external debt restructuring exercise, market analysts said.

At the Treasury Bill auction, a sharp decline of nine percent was noted especially in the three-month Treasury Bill rate. Further, rays of hopes were created when State Minister for Finance Shehan Semasinghe said, without giving a date, that Sri Lanka is expecting a second round of talks with private investors ‘very soon’ to restructure sovereign bonds.

Sri Lanka is planning to complete debt restructuring by June 2024 and to go to the IMF board for the next round.
