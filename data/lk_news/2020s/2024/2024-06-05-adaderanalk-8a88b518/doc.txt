High risk of communicable diseases spreading in country

The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) says that there is a high risk for communicable diseases to spread in the country due to the recent floods in various parts of the island.

The contamination of water sources has been cited as the main cause of this.

Chief Medical Officer of Health in the Public Health Department of Colombo Municipal Council, Dr M.A.S.G. Rathnawardhana requested to make sure to always drink water that has been boiled and left to cool, whenever possible.

She stated that due to the current contamination of water sources, there is an increased risk of communicable diseases like diarrhea and Leptospirosis (rat fever) spreading. Therefore, drinking boiled or bottled water whenever possible is highly advisable.

The Chief Medical Officer further stated to “ensure that fruits and vegetables are washed before consumption. It is also recommended to avoid eating raw vegetables and fruits during this period. The cleaning process should involve guidance from public health inspectors.”
