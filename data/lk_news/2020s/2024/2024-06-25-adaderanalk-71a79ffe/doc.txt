Govt. to empower ‘Piriven’ education with digital technology

The Cabinet of Ministers has green-lighted the introduction of digital technology for ‘Piriven’ education.

The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Technology have jointly planned to implement a program in order to empower ‘Piriven’ education by the introduction of digital technology.

Through this, Piriven-related teachers and both clergy and non-clergy students will be able to utilise digital technology to explore and analyze the Sri Lankan national Buddhist heritage, the Department of Government Information (DGI) said in a statement.

Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved the joint proposal presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Minister of Technology and Minister of Education Susil Premajayantha to implement the proposed program to provide at least two computers, a smart board and a printer for each ‘Pirivena’ (monastic college).
