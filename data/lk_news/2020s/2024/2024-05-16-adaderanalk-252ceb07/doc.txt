Showery and windy conditions to enhance during next few days

The Meteorology Department warns that showery and windy conditions are expected to enhance during the next few days due to pre-monsoonal conditions over the country and surrounding sea areas.

Issuing a special weather bulletin today, valid for the next week, it said heavy rainfalls are likely over the South-western parts of the country particularly in Western, Sabaragamuwa, and Central and North-western provinces and in Galle, Matara and Mannar districts.

Strong winds of about 60-70 kmph accompanied with heavy rainfalls can be expected areas around the country and over the sea area bounded by (0-10) N (60-90) E, says the Met. Department.

The general public, fishing and naval community are kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
