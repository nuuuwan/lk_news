Railway strike expected to disrupt train services

The Locomotive Operating Engineers’ Union of Sri Lanka Railways says they have  launched a strike from midnight yesterday (06).

The trade union action is being carried out over delays in second-class promotions of locomotive drivers and several other issues, according to the Locomotive Operating Engineers’ Union.

Secretary of the union  S.R.C.M. Senanayake said that only locomotive drivers of two of the five running sheds have joined the strike and due to this there will be no power set trains operating.

He further stated that even though the morning office trains would experience minimal impact from the strike, there is a possibility that all the trains scheduled for this evening might be cancelled.

However, Ada Derana learns that only 84 locomotive drivers are engaged in this trade union action based on their own promotion issues.

President of the union, Chandana Lal, stated that the ongoing strike is not a result of a decision made by Locomotive Operating Engineers’ Union and that the strike has been initiated based on a decision taken by the union’s secretary.
