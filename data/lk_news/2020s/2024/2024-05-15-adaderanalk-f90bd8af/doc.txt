CEB facing serious shortage of engineers – officials tell COPE

It has been revealed during the meeting of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) that about 130 engineers of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) have left the service as of recently.

Responding to a question put forward by MP Madhura Withanage during the meeting, the Deputy Managing Director of CEB Mr. Palitha Perera said that there are 330 vacancies for engineers in total presently.

“130 have resigned last year and within the first 4 months of this year. We have a shortfall of 330 engineers because we did not recruit for those who have retired,” he said.

Meanwhile, it was revealed in the COPE meeting that the Ceylon Electricity Board has incurred losses of billions of rupees by making emergency power purchases without buying the Ace Power Station when it was proposed.
