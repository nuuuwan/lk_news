New Director appointed to Eye Hospital after doctors threaten to strike

A new Director has been appointed to the National Eye Hospital, following the warnings from doctors that they would resort to a strike action demanding the removal of the Acting Director of the hospital from his position.

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) had previously stated that they would launch a trade union action protesting against the Acting Director of National Eye Hospital.

Media Spokesman of the association Dr Chamil Wijesinghe said that they made a request to the relevant authorities this morning (23) to oust the Acting Director from his position.

Furthermore, he had said: “There is a very tense situation in the eye hospital. This person [the Acting Director] does not behave in a way that suits his position at all.”
