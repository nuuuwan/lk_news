Strike disrupts nearly 100 train services

Colombo, June 07 (Daily Mirror) - Despite the Railways Department announcing that services could be restored by this afternoon due to the ongoing strike, nearly 100 train services were cancelled today leaving commuters in disarray.

The strike which began at midnight last night was launched by the Sri Lanka Railways Locomotive Operating Engineersâ€™ Union in response to issues regarding the promotion of locomotive drivers and continuous delays in recruitment.

The ongoing strike caused significant disruptions, especially for commuters returning home in the afternoon, including many office workers.

While trains arrived in Colombo from all railway lines this morning, many services were halted in the afternoon, leaving passengers stranded and inconvenienced.
