Police launch CCTV based traffic violations detection programme

Colombo, Jan. 22 (Daily Mirror)- The police today launched the special programme aimed at identifying motorists violating traffic rules through the CCTV system in Colombo.

Public Security Minister Tiran Alles and Acting Inspector General of Police Deshabandu Thennakoon launched the programme at the CCTV division in Colombo with the identification of the first traffic violation through the CCTV system.

There are reportedly at least 108 CCTV cameras within the Colombo city, covering the main locations and flyovers.

Despite the programme being launched today, a week-long awareness campaign for motorists will also be held about this programme.

From February 01 the implementation of the law against traffic violators will commence, the IGP said.

Tennakoon emphasized that through the CCTV traffic violation identification system, officers on traffic duty will be able to provide an efficient service to minimize traffic congestions.

The Acting IGP said video evidence of the relevant offenses captured by the Traffic Division's CCTV system will be forwarded to the respective police stations, and fines for the offenses will be issued to the drivers.

Meanwhile, Minister Alles said the programme will be expanded soon to cover the entire country while using the latest technology.

He said not only the technology within the CCTV Division, but each division of the Sri Lanka Police should be developed to use modern technology.
