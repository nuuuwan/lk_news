Adani Power’s Q3 FY24 financials driven by ‘improved power demand’

Adani Power Ltd. (APL), a part of Adani portfolio companies, recently announced the financial results for the third quarter ended at 31st December 2023.Commenting on the quarterly results, S.B Khyalia, CEO, Adani Power Limited, said, “Adani Power continues to demonstrate its leadership across domains by achieving ever-higher standards of excellence, as evidenced by the financial results for the third quarter of FY 2023-24. The Company’s strategically located power plants and optimal capacity allocation between PPAs and merchant capacities, coupled with its strength in fuel management & logistics and excellence in power plant O&M, have allowed it to address growing power demand and generate robust profitability.

This has resulted in improved liquidity, which has in turn been utilized to reduce debt. The ongoing brownfield capacity expansion of 1,600 MW at Mahan is on track, while we are moving ahead to extend our leadership further inorganically. We are excited to be a part of nation-building efforts through provision of reliable electricity supply from our highly efficient power plants while keeping sustainability goals at the forefront of our agenda.”

The operating performance for Q3 FY 2023-24 includes the 1,600 MW Godda Ultra-supercritical thermal power plant of APL’s subsidiary Adani Power (Jharkhand) Limited (APJL), which was commissioned in Q1 FY 2023-24. During the third quarter as well as the nine months period of FY 2023-24 ended 31st December 2023, higher volumes were contributed by the Mundra, Udupi, Raipur, and Mahan plants apart from the incremental contribution of the Godda power plant, which has quickly become an important part of the power supply ecosystem of Bangladesh. Domestic power sales volumes were driven by growing power demand across India, and offtake under Power Purchase Agreements (“PPAs”) was further supported by falling prices of imported coal and alternate fuel.

The increase in Continuing Operational Revenues for Q3 and the first nine months (9M) FY 2023-24 was a result of higher sales volumes including addition of sales under the Godda PPA, and higher merchant sales. While merchant tariffs realized were higher as compared to the corresponding periods of FY 2022-23 due to improved power demand, blended tariffs under domestic PPAs were lower due to lower import fuel prices and alternate fuel costs.
