Unhealthy Competition in Tourism Must Be Stopped - EDITORIAL

There was a recent report in the Daily Mirror stating the inconveniences caused to locals due to businesses conducted by Israeli, Russian and Ukrainian nationals in the southern part of Sri Lanka. This report demands deep pondering investigation.

As much as such businesses are eating into the earning opportunities of locals, we also must think that there are hidden opportunities for business here when some people think that all is lost in this sun-kissed paradise island. These foreign nationals are operating bars, restaurants, giving surfing lessons, buying or leasing lands and renting out tuk-tuks; the latter to cut down on travel expenses. Wow! The message that foreign nationals are giving to all of Sri Lanka is that ‘if you cannot do business here in this country we’ll show you how’.

Now don’t get the message from this editorial wrong. This editorial, which carries the opinion of the newspaper, initially suggests that businesses must be regulated where tourists are concerned. Tourists here on tourists visas cannot engage in business and that’s a point taken. However, Sri Lankans must take it into their heads that they are not enterprising enough to use natural island resources to generate new businesses and bring dollars and investors into this country. The issue slowing down this country is the ‘leg pulling’ habit of unions, environmentalists and traditionalists when a new idea is implemented in this country. Try opening a hotel in any part of this island where nature greets you with a ‘good morning’ and you’ll see protesters agitating with boards in hand wanting you to stop it. Environmentalists also would not allow you to operate freely when kick-starting most income generating operations.

Tourism is one of the biggest income generators in this country. There must be more infrastructure development to help this business boom. Hoteliers must be given tax concessions, roads on the tourism belt must be in better condition, and the state must ensure that tourists receive a faster and more efficient service when they engage with state entities like banks and immigration and emigration authorities. Where are the electric tuk-tuks the government promised to deliver to the market? Travelling around the island would be more convenient and cheaper for foreign tourists if there are electric tuk-tuks in plenty.

These Russian, Ukrainian and Israeli nationals also have their money dealing system which is known as ‘Undial’ – an underground banking system. Now surely, the intended dollars would certainly not enter the country and be regulated through a proper banking system, given that such a questionable banking system used by foreigners is in operation. This is why local businessmen are up in arms and demanding that the law enforcement authorities regulate such businesses

These Russian, Ukrainian and Israeli nationals also have their money dealing system which is known as ‘Undial’ – an underground banking system. This greatly handicaps the locals who are catering to tourism needs through their businesses. And surely, the intended dollars would certainly not enter the country and be regulated through a proper banking system, given that such a questionable banking system used by foreigners is in operation. This is why local businessmen are up in arms and demanding that the law enforcement authorities regulate such businesses. Locals point out even bilateral ties that Sri Lanka has with these three countries can be harmed due to these questionable business operations taking place in this island.

There are also concerns that tourists are overstaying their visas. Now this just shows that the authorities don’t know or have no control of this ugly side of tourism. All this has led to unhealthy competition between locals and tourists who are both operating the same kind of businesses. Also if a local offers lodging to a tourist whose visa has expired he (the local) is engaging in illegal business, however lucrative that venture would be.

The other issue that causes great concern where ever tourists visit is the garbage problem. The municipalities must do a better job to ensure Sri Lanka is a cleaner, nicer place; and even employ workers and pay them overtime to work around the clock to keep the cities clean.  Sri Lankans are ‘champions’ at promoting Sri Lanka as a must visit country, but seriously, the tourism industry here must be better regulated, and more opportunities must given to local businessmen whilst unhealthy competition must be stopped.
