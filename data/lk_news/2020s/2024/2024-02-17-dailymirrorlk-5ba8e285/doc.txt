Prison hospital congestion reaches critical levels

Colombo, Feb 17 (Daily Mirror) - It has been revealed that the current capacity at the prison hospital has reached unprecedented levels, raising grave concerns among authorities.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, media spokesperson of the Prisons Department Gamini B. Dissanayake said the current inmate count at the facility stands at 350, significantly exceeding its capacity of 185.

The matter has sparked serious concerns among the authorities and measures are underway to mitigate congestion.

However, Dissanayake asserted that there is no possibility of expanding the hospital capacity but the overcrowding will be eased as patients get discharged on a regular basis.

According to reports, this dire situation has forced authorities to accommodate two patients in a single bed due to the lack of space.
