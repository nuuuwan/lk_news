Floods malfunction railway signal system

Colombo, June 2 (Daily Mirror) - Railway services have been disrupted due to the inundation of several stations, the Railways Department said.

They said the signaling system has been affected due to sudden floods.

Accordingly, errors in the signaling system were recorded at several places on the main, the coastal and the Puttalam lines.

It is reported that some trains may be delayed due to this situation.

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Railways General Manager N.J. Indipolage said that train services have been disrupted due to trees falling on the track at many locations.

Since a bridge between Waga and Kosgama railway stations was swept away by flood waters, steps have been taken to limit the trains running on the Kelani Valley line only up to the Waga railway station.
