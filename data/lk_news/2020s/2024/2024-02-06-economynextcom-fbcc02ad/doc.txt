ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has to conduct presidential and general elections within the 10 billion rupees allocated for them in the 2024 budget, cabinet spokesman Bandula Gunawardena said.

“An allocation of 10 billion rupees was set aside by the budget for the year 2024, for covering the expenditure of the presidential election and general election this year,” Gunawardena said at a press briefing on Tuesday to announce cabinet decisions.
