Dilith Jayaweera to enter Parliament through ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ national list

The ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ alliance has decided to nominate the leader of the alliance and Gampaha District parliamentary candidate Dilith Jayaweera as an MP through the party’s National List, the General Secretary of ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ Ranjan Seneviratne said.

Issuing a statement, the ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ announced that this decision was reached unanimously by the alliance’s executive committee.

Accordingly, the Executive Committee of the Sarvajana Balaya decided to nominate Dilith Jayaweera as the party’s National List MP and to convey the decision to the Election Commission today, he said.

Formed less than 06 months ago, the ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ managed to secure 178,006 votes islandwide at the 2024 General Election, which was the sixth highest total votes obtained by a political party or an independent group which contested the election, and obtained a single bonus seat.

Thus, this will be the first time where an MP will represent the ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ alliance in Sri Lanka’s Parliament.
