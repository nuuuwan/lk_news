Nimal Siripala appointed Acting Chairman of SLFP

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has decided to appoint Minister of Ports, Aviation and Shipping Nimal Siripala de Silva as the party’s Acting Chairman.

This decision has been arrived at during the SLFP politburo meeting led by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, which was held this morning (08) at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute.

The SLFP convened the party’s politburo in order to discuss the future course of action of the party, in view of its current internal crisis situation. It was reported that all party members excluding former President Maithripala Sirisena, former General Secretary Dayasiri Jayasekara and MP Shan Vijayalal de Silva have been invited for the relevant meeting.

On Thursday (04), the Colombo District Court issued an interim injunction preventing former President Maithripala Sirisena from functioning as the SLFP chairman, following a complaint filed by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.

Nevertheless, Sirisena has reacted, saying that he intends to present facts before the court regarding the matter.

Meanwhile, the Acting General Secretary of SLFP Dushmantha Mithrapala lodged a complaint with the Maradana Police on Friday (05), alleging that several ‘important’ files have gone missing from the party headquarters.

Thus, entering the SLFP headquarters in Darley Road, Colombo 10, has been prohibited for all individuals, due to the ongoing investigation into the relevant complaint.

Earlier in March, former President Maithripala Sirisena had stirred controversy when he claimed he was aware of the true mastermind of the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks and that he was prepared to disclose the information to the judiciary if inquired from him or if an order is issued regarding the matter.

Speaking to the media in Kandy, Sirisena said that he is ready to disclose the relevant information and that at the same time, it is the responsibility of the judges to keep the information strictly confidential.
