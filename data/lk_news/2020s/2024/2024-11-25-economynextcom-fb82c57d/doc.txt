Sri Lanka new gov performance can only be evaluated during 5th IMF review: former minister

ECONOMYNEXT – The true performance of the new National People’s Power administration can only be evaluated during the fifth International Monetary Fund review, former State Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe has said.

“The true performance of the new administration can only be evaluated during the 5th review, which will exclusively cover their period in office. (Jan to Jun 2025),” Semasinghe said on social platform X.

“Even the fourth review will largely reflect the achievements of our government. It is essential that the new administration continues to follow the EFF programme, despite their past opposition, to ensure sustained economic progress.”

The former state minister said he was pleased that the staff-level agreement has been reached between the IMF and Sri Lankan authorities, marking the successful completion of the third review of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme.

“This achievement paves the way to unlock the fourth tranche of financial assistance, reinforcing Sri Lanka’s journey toward economic recovery.

“It is important to note that the period under review, from January to June 2024, during President Ranil Wickramasinghe’s tenure. This crucial period for Sri Lanka gave full confidence in reaching the staff-level agreement, reflecting the progress achieved, not only meeting but exceeding agreed targets in several areas.”

Revamp of Sri Lanka’s IMF programme is within its “guard rails”

The current administration, despite initially opposing the EFF programme the previous administration introduced to revitalize the economy, has now acknowledged its indispensable role in addressing the country’s challenges, Semasinghe pointed out.

“This shift highlights the critical importance of adhering to a structured and disciplined framework to ensure Sri Lanka’s economic stability and growth.” (Colombo/Nov25/2024)
