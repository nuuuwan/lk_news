Special notice from SriLankan on Europe flights as Israel-Iran tensions rise

SriLankan Airlines says it is currently modifying its flight paths for European destinations as a precautionary measure amidst the current tensions between Israel and Iran.

In a press release, the national carrier explained that these changes mean that flight times to Europe are extended, requiring additional fuel and reducing the available payload.

Additionally, in order to meet slot times in London, these flights are being advanced by one hour, the airline said further, adding that some passengers on the London flights unfortunately have missed connections or been offloaded, as a result.

The airline asserted that it would maintain this routing and the earlier departure time to London for the next few days while monitoring the situation. However, the departure times from London, and to and from other European cities remain unchanged.

SriLankan Airlines noted that it is in direct communication with affected passengers, providing assistance with alternative flight arrangements and hotel accommodation.

At the same time, passengers to London have been advised to arrive at the airport in good time.

“We regret any inconvenience caused due to the current situation, and we thank you for your understanding and cooperation as we prioritize safety above all else,” SriLankan said highlighting that the safety of the passengers and crew remains its top priority.
