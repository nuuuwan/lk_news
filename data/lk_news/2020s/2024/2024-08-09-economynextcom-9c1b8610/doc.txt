Harin, Manusha say happy to leave after helping make Sri Lanka stable

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s ex-tourism Minister Harin Fernando said he was glad to have crossed over and helped President Ranil Wickremesinghe stabilize the country, after losing his portfolio due to a court order.

“When I joined Ranil Wickremesinghe, the country was in dire straits,” Fernando told reporters hours after the court upheld a decision by Samagi Jana Balawegaya to expel him along with Manusha Nanayakkara.

“I am glad that I did. Yesterday I realized this was going to happen so I drove to pilawoos on my own and at a koththu.”

“Now I will have more time to devote to Ranil Wickremesinghe’s campaign.”

Nayanayakkara, who also lost his portfolio, said he had no regrets.

“We have made the country win,” he said. “We crossed over when people were dying of dehydration on fuel queues. We are proudly leaving our ministers.”

Fernando said he had previously resigned his positions to contest.

Before leaving his office he said he picked up some photos that he had and a trophy that the tourism promotion office that was given to Sri Lanka he returned to officials.

“That trophy did not belong to me but the officials who did the work,” he said. “Some of the photos were from the first foreign trips we did in the crisis. We did not stay at hotels. I stayed at friends’ houses and met foreigners. So I felt a bit emotional about that.

“I went in my own vehicle. I did not use a ministry car. My father gave me the car in 2011. It is still in good condition. So I left in that.”

Fernando said he wanted to thank SJB leader Sajith Premadasa for appointing him to the national list, making him an member of parliament so that he could serve the people at a time of need.

Nanayakkara said he wanted to thank all the supporters of the SJB that voted for him. (Colombo/Aug09/2024)
