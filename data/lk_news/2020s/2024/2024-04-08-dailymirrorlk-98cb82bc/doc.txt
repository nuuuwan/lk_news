SLFP appoints Nimal Siripala as acting Chairman

Colombo, April 08 (Daily Mirror) - Minister of Ports, Aviation and Shipping Nimal Siripala de Silva has been appointed as Acting Chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).

The appointment was made at the SLFP politburo meeting held this morning at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute under the chairmanship of former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.

The Colombo District Court last week issued an interim injunction, barring former President Maithripala Sirisena from functioning as SLFP Chairman.
