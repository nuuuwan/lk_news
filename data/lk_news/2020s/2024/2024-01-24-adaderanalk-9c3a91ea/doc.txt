The relevant cash rewards will be awarded to the individuals who provide information for the ‘Yukthiya’ special police operation, through which multiple successful raids have been carried out since its launch on December 17, 2023 to crack down on narcotics distribution and criminal offences in the country.

Accordingly, the Acting Inspector General of Police Deshabandu Tennakoon has given instructions to all the Senior DIGs, DIGs, and the Officers In-Charge of each police division regarding the matter.

Accordingly, Rs. 250,000 is offered to tip-offs about automatic firearms such as T56, AK47, M16, SAR80 and T81 as well as semi-automatic firearms including 84S, SLR, auto loading shotguns.

When a suspect is arrested along with an impounded revolver, the informant will be offered Rs. 150,000. The seizure of a revolver without a suspect will lead to a cash reward of Rs. 100.000.
