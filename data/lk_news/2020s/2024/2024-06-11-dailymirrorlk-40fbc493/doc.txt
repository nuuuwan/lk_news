Severe weather warning for rough seas, strong winds

June 11 (Daily Mirror) - Coastal regions in Sri Lanka are bracing for severe weather conditions as the Meteorology Department has issued a warning for very rough seas and strong gusty winds in several sea areas.

Accordingly, the sea areas extending from Trincomalee to Kalpitiya, via Kankasanthurai and Mannar, are expected to be particularly affected.

These regions will experience very rough conditions with wind speeds reaching between 60-70 km/h. Further, the sea areas stretching from Hambantota to Pottuvil are also forecasted to face very rough seas with similarly strong gusty winds.

As such, the Meteorology Department has urged naval and fishing communities to exercise extreme caution and remain vigilant.

In addition to the marine warning, significant rainfall is expected at times in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, and North-Western provinces, as well as in the Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Galle, and Matara districts.

Some places in the Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces may experience fairly heavy showers, with rainfall amounts reaching up to 75 mm, as per the latest report.

Showers or thundershowers are also likely to occur at a few places in the Uva province in the evening or night.
