Kandakadu Policy Change: Unsuitable Individuals Excluded

COLOMBO (News 1st); Rehabilitation Commissioner General, Retired Major General Darshana Hettiarachchi, has announced a significant shift in policy following recent conflicts at the Kandakadu Treatment and Rehabilitation Center.

The Commissioner General has pledged to avoid housing individuals deemed unsuitable for rehabilitation into the centers henceforth.

The policy change comes in the wake of the arrest of 34 individuals who were implicated in instigating conflicts at the Kandakadu Treatment and Rehabilitation Center on the 4th of February.

The group has since been presented to the court under several charges, as confirmed by Major General Darshana Hettiarachchi.

In a decisive move, all individuals who contributed to the violent acts at the Kandakadu Treatment and Rehabilitation Center have been removed.

Commissioner General Hettiarachchi further emphasized his cautious approach in obtaining court orders to refer individuals to rehabilitation.

This is expected to ensure that only those suitable for rehabilitation are admitted into the centers.
