Sri Lanka cabinet nod to elect 160 members on first-past-the-post system

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Cabinet of ministers have approved a proposal to draft an amendment to the constitution to elect 160 out of the 225 members of parliament on the first-past-the-post system, the government information office said.

The approval comes amid reports President Ranil Wickremesinghe informed the Cabinet that Presidential elections will be held this year.

“To meet the goal of the Election Expenses Regulation Act No. 03 of 2023, and achieve a truly democratic election process, the present electoral system has to be changed,” the statement said.

A ministerial sub-committee was formed tasked with producing a report to Cabinet after obtaining feedback from all party leaders represented in parliament and other relevant stakeholders, the statement continued.

“According to the feedback received, a majority of ministers have agreed to change the system so that 160 of the 225 Members of Parliament will be elected through votes of the relevant election division, while the remaining 65 will be chosen through the proportional representation system from the national or provincial level.”

Recommendations made by a committee headed by Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena to amend the electoral system will also be included.

Cabinet approved the proposal by the Minister of Justice to draft the relevant legislation.

The proportional representation in which a prospective member has to camppaign in an entire district has come under fire for requiring too much campaign financing and opening the doors for more corruption.

There has been support by smaller parties for Sri Lanka’s proportional representation system as they can get elected with residual votes in a district due to a cut off level below that of some other countries.
