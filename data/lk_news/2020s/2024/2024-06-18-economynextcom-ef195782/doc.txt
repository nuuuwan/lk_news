Sri Lanka to exempt one house from imputed rent wealth tax: President

ECONOMYNEXT  – Sri Lanka will exempt one house from a proposed wealth tax outlined in an International Monetary Fund program, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.

About 90 percent of the people’s houses are likely to be exempt from the proposed tax, he said.

“[O]ne house will be exempt from this,” President Wickremesinghe told parliament Monday.

“It is going to have a very high threshold and I do not think the vast majority of the people in this country should even be worried about their house

The IMF program document however did not mention an exemption on one house, but did mention an exemption threshold.

Taxing houses and thrift in general could have detrimental effects on people’s well-being, housing stock and their willingness to remain in the country without migrating, critics say.

The mechanism of imputed rents was used because rates on houses were assigned to provincial councils and courts could strike it down.

Opposition legislator Harsha de Silva said the Samagi Jana Balwegaya welcomed President Wickremesinghe’s statement.

In social media there is active discussion about taxing houses and savings.

“When we paid income tax for the money we bought the land,” according to a post going viral.

Paid stamp duty for buying the land. Paid vat import duty etc for all building materials to build the house. Paid rates on a annual basis for the value of the property.

“Now we are asked to pay a tax for living in that house as the owner 🥲.

“Very soon we will have annual tax for having to be married and for creating kids as its supposed to be a burden for the state.”

In some countries, married couples filing together gets tax credits.

Sri Lanka has monetary stability due to so-called flexible inflation targeting (an operating framework of a floating regime foisted upon on a central bank with a reserve target), triggering exchange rate depreciation, outright currency crises, output shocks, spikes in deficits and debt, eventual external defaults and high tax rates.
