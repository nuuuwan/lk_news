Gazette to be issued on new speed limit regulations

State Minister of Transport, Lasantha Alagiyawanna, stated that the on-going strikes are motivated by political interests rather than genuine professional rights.

He also announced that a gazette with the necessary regulations on speed limits, aimed at reducing road accidents, will be issued within the next two weeks, said President’s Media Devision.

State Minister for Transport Lasantha Alagiyawanna, made this statement during a news conference held yesterday (11) at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC), under the theme ‘Collective Path to a Stable Country’.

“We have initiated several programs to enhance efficiency in the transport sector. Notably, the Kadawatha bus terminal is scheduled to be opened in August under the patronage of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. These bus terminals incorporate modern transport management methods and advanced technology.

In 2023, there were 2,214 reported road accidents resulting in 2,321 deaths. As of the 30th of June, 1,103 road accidents have been reported this year, with 1,154 fatalities. To address this issue, our Ministry has implemented various programs aimed at reducing the number of road accidents.

The National Council for Road Safety has allocated LKR 50 million to the Sri Lanka Police for the purchase of necessary speed control equipment. Additionally, the Ministry of Transport will issue a gazette with new road speed limit regulations within the next two weeks.

Furthermore, arrangements have been made to provide teachers with manuals for establishing Road Safety Clubs at the school level. These clubs will be included in the school system as an extracurricular activity, and a medal awarding program has also been introduced.

Additionally, we are actively engaged in addressing issues related to the rail strike. The Public Service Commission has already granted approval for the promotion of station masters every five years. The necessary Cabinet paper seeking approval from the Cabinet for this promotion has been prepared.

However, it is evident to the public that the current strikes are motivated purely by political agendas. It should be noted that these strikes do not stem from genuine professional grievances”.
