CEB to submit electricity tariff reduction proposal to PUCSL today

The proposal seeking to reduce electricity tariffs will be handed over to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) during the course of the day, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) says.

Its spokesperson, Eng. Noel Priyantha said the state-owned electricity supplier intends to provide the benefits of the profits it earned to the consumers through this tariff revision.

Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera told the Parliament yesterday (Feb.22) that the CEB expects to reduce the rates by at least the same rates and percentages increased in October 2023.

In October last year, the electricity tariffs were raised by 18% for domestic and religious places of worship, by 12% for industries and hotels and by 24% for government institutions.
