Heavy rainfall and strong winds expected over the island

The Meteorology Department says that Southwest monsoon conditions are gradually establishing over the island and hence the prevailing showery and windy conditions will continue further.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central, North-western, Southern and Northern provinces, it said.

Very heavy showers about 150mm are likely at some places in Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces and in Kandy and Nuwara-Eliya districts. Heavy showers above 100mm are likely at some places in North-western province and in Mannar, Galle and Matara districts.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places elsewhere of the island.

Strong winds about 40-50 kmph at times are possible in the western slope of the central hills and in Southern province. Fairly strong winds about 30-40 kmph can be expected at times elsewhere of the island.

The general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
