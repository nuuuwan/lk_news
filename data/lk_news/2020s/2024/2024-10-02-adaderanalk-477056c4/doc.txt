Parties that backed Ranil to contest general election under ‘Gas Cylinder’ symbol

All political parties that supported former President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the recent Presidential Election are to contest the upcoming General Election under the New Democratic Front (NDF), with the ‘Gas Cylinder’ as their symbol.

Former President Wickremesinghe had also contested the recent presidential election under the symbol of the ‘Gas Cylinder’, albeit as an independent candidate.

Political sources told Ada Derana, earlier today, that former MPs who supported Wickremesinghe are preparing to contest the upcoming General Election under either the ‘elephant’ symbol or another common symbol.

It was reported that the opinion of the Election Commission had been sought to obtain the ‘Gas Cylinder’ symbol and that a final decision was to be taken after the commission’s decision is conveyed.

The group of former MPs had gathered at the Election Operations office of the former president at Flower Road in Colombo today (02), in order to reach the final decision regarding the symbol and the alliance they will contest under in the upcoming election.

It was further reported that if the former MPs were unable to obtain the ‘Gas Cylinder’ symbol, they would most likely contest under the symbol of the ‘Elephant’ or another common symbol.
