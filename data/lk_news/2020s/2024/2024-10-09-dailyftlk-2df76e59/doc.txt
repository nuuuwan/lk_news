Sri Lanka to seek BRICS memberships at upcoming meeting in Russia

Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Vijitha Herath yesterday said Sri Lanka is set to pursue membership in the BRICS economic bloc during an upcoming meeting in Russia later this month.

“Sri Lanka has been invited to the BRICS meeting later this month and we expect to seek membership,” he said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

Herath added that discussions on Sri Lanka’s BRICS membership ambitions were also held with Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar during his recent visit to Colombo.

The push to join BRICS follows a decision made by the previous administration, which has approved the move to join the organisation that includes major global economies such as China, India and Brazil.

BRICS originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, is a prominent intergovernmental organisation of emerging market nations aimed at boosting economic cooperation. This year, the group has already expanded welcoming four new members, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the UAE.

Against this backdrop, Sri Lanka’s potential inclusion in BRICS would mark a significant step towards deepening its economic ties with key global players and further integrating into international economic platforms.
