Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon states that 42 Interpol ‘Red Notices’ have been issued against criminals who have fled the country and are in connection with underworld activities and drug offences.

Joining the event to declare open a new police checkpoint in front of the Colombo National Hospital, Tennakoon expressed that the relevant criminal suspects would be brought back to the island with the assistance of Interpol.

Furthermore, he mentioned that main accomplice of the notorious underworld figure Salindu Malshika alias “Kudu Salindu,” who was repatriated to Sri Lanka early this morning, will be interrogated further to uncover more details regarding drug syndicates operating in the country.

The Acting IGP also pledged to repatriate the police officer who assisted the underworld figure Nadun Chinthaka alias “Harak Kata” in his failed attempt to escape from the custody of Criminal Investigation Department (CID). He said the repatriation is expected soon, with support from the Interpol as soon as possible.
