Fahmy doing it…his way

Fahmy Nazick will be seen in action at the Anchorman’s 20th Anniversary Gala Dinner Dance, on 31st, May, in Canada, and he is eagerly looking forward to entertaining the large crowd expected with his style of music.

Says Fahmy: “Lots of events are taking place but not my style of music. I have nothing against oriental music but that seems to be the trend now.

“In fact, Binara, from Binara and the Clan, reached out to me recently and is keen to organise a dance and have me doing all my style of music because he says that some of the audience may not even know what western music is like.

Fahmy is a classy singer whose style of singing covers the Elvis Presley/Jim Reeves era.
