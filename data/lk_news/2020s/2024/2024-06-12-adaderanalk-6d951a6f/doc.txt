PUCSL approval for CEB’s new electricity tariff revision by mid-July

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) says that the granting of approval for the new electricity tariff revision proposed by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is anticipated to be finalized by mid-July.

PUCSL Chairman, Prof. Manjula Fernando, stated that public consultations on the tariff revision proposal will also be held before a final decision is reached.

Prof. Fernando indicated that the PUCSL’s final conclusion regarding the tariff revision will be communicated to the CEB by the second week of July.

However, this follows a statement made by Minister of Power and Energy, Kanchana Wijesekera, who recently told Parliament that electricity tariffs are expected to be reduced with effect from July 1.
