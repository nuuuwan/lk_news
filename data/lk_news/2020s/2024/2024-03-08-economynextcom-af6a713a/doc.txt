Sri Lanka to call tenders for 50MW Mannar wind power plant

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka plans to call tenders for a 50 MegaWatt wind plant in the North Eastern Mannar area, next week Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said as investor interest increased amid economic stability.

“A lot of investors are showing interest,” Minister Wijesekera told reporters Thursday. “Accordingly, we plan to call tenders for 10 wind and solar plants from local and foreign investors.”

“Next week we plan to advertise tenders for a 50MW wind plant in Mannar.”

Mannar is an area with a Ceylon Electricity Board wind plant with proven plant factor of around 45 percent which sharply reduces the costs per unit.

Daily output sometimes gusts up to 60 percent according to some of the data in the public domain.

Sri Lanka will also reach agreements with investors for other sites who have proposed prices between 26 and 30 rupees, Minister Wijesekera said.

Bids for a 100MW renewable plant in Siyambalanduwa had come in at 8 US cents a unit, he said.

Sri Lanka planned to sign agreements quickly with earlier proposals between 25 and 26 rupees, he said.

“For a project to be approved, signed and implemented it takes at least two years,” Wijesekera said.

“We expect the Siyambalanduwa project to connect by the end of 2025. (Colombo/Mar08/2024)
