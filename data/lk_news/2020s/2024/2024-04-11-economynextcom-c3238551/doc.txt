Sri Lanka airport, port get scanners and smart toilets from Japan

ECONOMYNEXT – Japan has gifted Sri Lanka 8.4 million dollars worth equipment to improve operations at the Bandaranaike International Airport and the Colombo Port.

“The Japanese government has arranged to provide a stock of high-tech scanning machines worth 8.4 million US dollars to the Katunayake International Airport and the Port of Colombo in order to monitor disease conditions harmful to public health such as epidemics and infectious diseases that come to this country by foreigners,” a statement by the Government Department of Information said.

Scanners that detect diseases, baggage scanners, full body scanners, foreign passport scanners and a biometric access control system have been provided, under this project supported by the International Organization for Migration (IOM).

The island nation has seen a rise in visitor arrivals, and the number is expected to increase, especially with the country attracting cruise ships.

“Tourists are going to come to Sri Lanka through the ports in addition to the airports,” the statement said

The first batch of equipment was handed over to the Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva on Wednesday at Katunayake Airport by the Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Misukoshi Hideaki.

A smart toilet system with 150 units will also be constructed at the BIA as part of this project. (Colombo/Apr11/2024)
