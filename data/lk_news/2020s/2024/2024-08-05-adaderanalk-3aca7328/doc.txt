Bangladesh PM has left Dhaka palace for ‘safer place’: Report

Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has left the capital Dhaka in the face of mass protests demanding her resignation, a source close to the embattled leader told AFP on Monday.

“She and her sister have left Ganabhaban (the premier’s official residence) for a safer place,” the source told AFP. “She wanted to record a speech. But she could not get an opportunity to do that.”

This comes as Bangladesh’s army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman is set to address the nation after 98 people were killed in fierce clashes yesterday, taking the death count since protests erupted last month to over 300.
