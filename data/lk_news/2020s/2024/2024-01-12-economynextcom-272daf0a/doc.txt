Sri Lanka to slash red tape for film tourism

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Tourism Promotion Bureau will get fast approval for foreign producers who want to use the South Asian island as a location, with Indian film-makers in particular looking for new locations, an official said.

“To shoot a film in Sri Lanka permission has to be obtained from 41 institutions,” Chairman of Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau Chalaka Gajabahu said.

On the suggestion of Tourism Minister Harin Fernando, a cabinet paper on the matter has been prepared by the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, to set up a ‘single window’, which will provide the required permission for a TV commercial in seven days and for a film in two weeks.

“They will now have to apply to us,” Gajabahu said. “We will obtain the permission and give it for a small facilities fee like 60 dollars.
