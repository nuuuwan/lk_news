Businessman claims Rs.50 Mn from Gota, Mahinda, Basil

Colombo, April 25 (Daily Mirror) -  A businessman, who was adversely affected by the country’s economic crisis, has sent letters of demand claiming Rs.50 million as damages from former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa, former CBSL Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal and the Monterey Board for mishandling the economic crisis in the country.

It has warned that legal action will be instituted against the above-mentioned individuals if the money with the interest is not paid within two weeks.

Businessman Kalinga Silva, who is engaged in producing disposable surgical items, has sent these letters of demand through Attorney-at-Law Pramod Polpitiya.

The businessman stated that due to the mishandling of the economy between 2019 and 2022, he was unable to carry out his business activities, resulting in a loss of Rs. 50 million. He further stated that the depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee against the US Dollar, restrictions imposed on imported items, and daily power cuts were the main reasons for the loss of business activities, for which the aforementioned individuals should be held responsible.

The businessman further stated that the Supreme Court judgement in SC FR 195/2022 held that several respondents including former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa, former CBSL Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal and the Monetary Board are responsible for mishandling the economic crisis in the country and they have violated the Public Trust reposed in them.
