IORA chair Sri Lanka invited for BRICS Foreign Minister summit in Russia

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka as the chair of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) has been invited to BRICS Foreign Ministers’ summit in Russia, the island nation’s Foreign Minister Ali Sabry said, from May 30-31 to discuss anti-microbial resistance.

BRICS is an intergovernmental organization comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates, while the IORA is a regional forum, tripartite in nature, bringing together representatives of Government, Business and Academia, for promoting co-operation and closer interaction among them.

We have been invited by BRICs Foreign Minsters’ meeting in Russia on the basis that we hold the chairman ship of the IORA,” Sabry told last week at a media briefing.

Moscow will host the International Conference titled “Antimicrobial Resistance: A Global Challenge to the National Well-Being of BRICS. Reality and Innovation” at the end of May.

Sri Lanka, a founding member of IORA, assumed the chairmanship in October 2023.

The Moscow Conference will be attended by roughly 100 representatives of BRICS countries, as well as the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), its official website showed.

Upon conclusion of the Conference, BRICS experts are expected to adopt a joint statement that will subsequently be presented at the High-Level Meeting of the UN General Assembly on Antibiotic Resistance in September 2024 in New York. (Colombo/May 13/2024)
