Air ambulance service between Maldives-Sri Lanka to begin on March 01

Colombo, Jan 30 (Daily Mirror) - An air ambulance service between the Maldives and the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) will start on March 1 this year as part of Phase I of the programme, Ports, Shipping and Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.

The announcement was made following a special meeting between the Maldives Transport and Aviation Services Minister Capt. Mohamed Ameen and Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva at the Ministry office today with the aim of initiating an air ambulance service between the two countries.

The service will enable Maldivian citizens to arrive promptly in Sri Lanka for urgent medical treatment in cases of accidents, illnesses and other health emergencies. Previously, Maldivian citizens were transported to India for emergency medical care.

"However, considering the quality of emergency treatment in Sri Lanka, the Maldivian government has decided to direct such patients to Sri Lankan hospitals in the future," the Maldivian Transport and Aviation Services Minister said.

The Minister has granted all necessary approvals to the airport officials and the Civil Aviation Authority for this and instructed the Ministry Secretary, K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, to establish a dedicated unit at the airport and ensure that it is equipped with all essential facilities
