President assures free land rights to 2 million by June

President Ranil Wickremesinghe instructed officials to expedite the completion of the national “Urumaya” freehold deeds program by June.

The President emphasized that it is the dream of every citizen to attain legal ownership of land, regardless of their background. He firmly believes that everyone should have this fundamental right.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe made these remarks while attending the ‘Urumaya’ Freehold Deeds program held in the Ottagapulam, in Jaffna on Friday.

Accordingly, 408 land deeds were vested with the people of Jaffna as part of the ‘Urumaya’ program, aimed at providing free land rights to 2 million individuals.

Under the leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the release of lands previously utilized by the Jaffna Security Force Headquarters was undertaken.

Jaffna Commander Major General Chandana Wickramasinghe presented the official land release documents to President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Subsequently, President Wickremesinghe handed over the documents to Jaffna District Governor Maradalingam Pradeepan.

According to the agreement, 234 acres of land from five Grama Niladhari Divisions in the Valikamam North were vested with locals. These lands are intended for agricultural purposes in alignment with the government’s agricultural modernization program.

As part of this initiative, seeds were distributed under the leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Following this distribution, the President engaged in cordial discussions with the land recipients and ceremoniously planted a sapling on the returned land.
