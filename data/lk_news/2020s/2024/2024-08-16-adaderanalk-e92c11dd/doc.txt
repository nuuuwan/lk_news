Prevailing showery condition over the South Western parts of the Island is expected to enhanced due to the low-level atmospheric disturbance in the vicinity of Sri Lanka during today and tomorrow (17), it said.

Heavy showers above 100 mm are likely at some places in Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces and in Galle, Matara, Kandy and Nuwara-Eliya districts, the advisory warns.
