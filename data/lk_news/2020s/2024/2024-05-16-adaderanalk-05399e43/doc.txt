Four arrested for attempted abduction of schoolgirl in Aladeniya

Four youths have been arrested on suspicion of attempting to abduct a 16-year-old schoolgirl who was on her way home after sitting for the G.C.E. Ordinary Level examination.

Following information received from a three-wheeler driver via the ‘119’ police emergency hotline regarding the abduction, Aladeniya Police had acted immediately and reportedly apprehended the suspects along with the van in question within an hour.

According to police, one of the arrested suspects had been involved in a relationship with the teenage girl, despite him already being married. The suspect, a former army soldier from Avissawella, and his friends had hired a van to carry out the abduction, police said.

The relationship had begun after the suspect had visited the girl’s brother, also an army soldier, at his home in Polonnaruwa on multiple occasions. Upon discovering that the suspect was married, the girl had ended the relationship. However, due to continuous threats from the suspect, the girl’s parents had moved her to a house in the Kulugammana area.

The abduction attempt has occurred while the student was returning home after sitting for the O/L examination in that area.
