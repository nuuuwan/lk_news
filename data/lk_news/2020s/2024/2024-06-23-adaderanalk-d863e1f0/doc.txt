Railway operations restored on Up-country Line

The railway operations on the Up-country Line have been restored after around 09 hours of disruption caused by fallen trees, Ada Derana reporter said.

Train operations had reportedly been disrupted due to several fallen trees on the tracks between the Inguru Oya and Galabada railway stations since early this morning (23).
