I am the mother of cannabis baby: Diana

Colombo, Feb 06 (Daily Mirror) -  Criticizing State Minister of Indigenous Medicine Sisira Jayakody whom she said had falsely claimed that he had submitted papers to the cabinet to seek approval for getting foreign investors for cannabis plantation, State Minister Diana Gamage said she is the mother of the cannabis baby.

“I am not disappointed at all with the cabinet’s move to reject the proposal to get foreign investors to grow cannabis in Sri Lanka. The whole world knows I am the one who initiated it and got it passed through in parliament. Sisira Jayakody opposed it from the beginning. There are TV interviews where he criticized me. There will be lots of fathers for my cannabis baby but they will have to remember I am the baby's mother,” Ms. Gamage told Daily Mirror.

Referring to a remark made by Cabinet spokesman Bandula Gunawardane who said the cabinet had rejected the promotion of cannabis plantation in Sri Lanka, she said the cabinet has actually rejected the proposal of State Minister Jayakody. “ it was Jayakody who said he submitted cabinet papers to promote cannabis plantation in Sri Lanka,”she said in this regard.
