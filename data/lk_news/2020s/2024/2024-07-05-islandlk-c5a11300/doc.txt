Keep genie in bottle

A person described as an entrepreneur from Moratuwa has filed a fundamental rights (FR) petition, seeking a Supreme Court (SC) determination on the duration of the president’s term, and an interim order preventing the official announcement of the next presidential election until the apex court decision. The members of the Election Commission (EC) including its Chairman and the Attorney General have been named as respondents. This petition has not come as a surprise. We are reminded of a vain attempt President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga made in 2005 to remain in office until 2006.

We thought the Constitution was very clear on the duration of the presidential term. Otherwise, the EC would not have undertaken to hold the presidential election this year itself. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was elected, in 2019, for a period of five years, and following his resignation in 2022, Parliament elected Ranil Wickremesinghe as his successor to serve the remainder of his term. We, however, do not intend to dwell on the legal aspects of a matter that is before the SC. They are best left to the learned judges. Instead, we discuss the political, social and economic issues that arise from poll postponements.

The Opposition is letting out howls of protest against surreptitious moves being made to postpone the upcoming presidential election. It has vowed to do everything in its power to defeat them on both political and legal fronts. The SJB, the JVP/NPP, and the SLPP dissidents have said they will come forward as intervenient petitioners in respect of the FR petition at issue. One cannot but appreciate their concerns about democracy and action to counter threats to the people’s franchise. They can rest assured that every right-thinking person, who cherishes democracy, will be on their side. (In this country, politicians fight for the people’s democratic rights only when they happen to be in the Opposition!)

Attempts to have the next presidential poll put off could prove counterproductive, for they are bound to go pear-shaped, and will be seen as proof that those who are behind them are afraid of facing elections.

The Presidential Media Division has issued a statement that President Wickremesinghe is of the view that the EC is right in having decided to hold the next presidential election this year. It has also said the person who filed the aforesaid petition had not consulted either President Wickremesinghe or his lawyers. But it is the UNP which has called for a poll postponement. Its General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara himself has reiterated that the presidential and parliamentary polls have to be put off.

The SLPP has claimed that it is against postponing elections. It seems to think that Sri Lankans are suffering from amnesia. It has postponed the Local Government polls twice. There is no bigger threat to democracy than a regime that undermines the people’s franchise. Elections not only help the people elect their representatives to run political institutions or govern the country but also enable them to canalise their resentment towards those at the levers of power in a democratic manner.

Pressure that builds up in a polity, where the people undergo unbearable economic hardships and are denied their democratic rights including franchise, or elections do not reflect the popular will due to malpractices, etc., tends to find expression in political upheavals. There have been several instances where poll postponements made Sri Lankan democracy scream. If the SLFP-led United Front government had not extended the life of Parliament by two years from 1975 to 1977, the UNP would not have been able to obtain a steamroller majority, which it abused in every conceivable manner to suppress democracy.

The scrapping of a general election due in 1982 with the help of a heavily-rigged referendum, under J. R. Jayewardene’s presidency, paved the way for the second JVP uprising and a bloodbath. Thousands of young lives were lost and state assets worth billions of rupees destroyed. The social and economic costs of the JVP’s reign of terror and the UNP’s equally savage counterterror operations were incalculable. The Gotabaya Rajapaksa government also blundered by putting off the LG polls. If they had been held on schedule, they would have allowed the public to give vent to their pent-up anger democratically, forcing that blundering regime to heed public opinion and make a course correction without provoking the people into taking to the streets. The postponement of the LG polls last year on President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s watch has also created a massive pressure build-up, which has the potential to erupt into an uprising. Another poll postponement will make the situation even more volatile.

Let those who are making a last-ditch attempt to delay the presidential election be warned that they are playing with fire. They had better recall that the Rajapaksas, who preened themselves on having defeated terrorism, had to head for the hills in 2022 as they, in their wisdom, chose to slight public opinion and ride roughshod over the people. Unless those who boast of waging a successful economic war abandon their attempts to subvert democracy and stop testing the people’s patience, which is manifestly wearing thin, it will soon be their turn to outrun the irate public.
