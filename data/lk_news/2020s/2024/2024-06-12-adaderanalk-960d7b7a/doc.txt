Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry, delivering his statement at the BRICS Foreign Ministers’ meeting, stated that Global South should collectively address global challenges of climate change, debt burden and food security, the Sri Lankan Embassy in Moscow said in a statement.

He further stressed that the architecture of global governance, established in the aftermath of World War II has achieved significant milestones. “However, that it was increasingly evident that this structure must evolve to reflect the contemporary realities of our world”, he added.

The Foreign Minister highlighted that voices and interests of emerging economies and developing nations must be integrated more fully into the decision-making processes of international institutions, the statement added.

Emphasizing the need for the rules based order, the Foreign Minister stated that “it is imperative that we strive hard to ensure a rules-based order, not only when it suits the rich and powerful, but as an equitable and justifiable model for a sustainable world order. This means upholding international law and ensuring the principles of fairness, justice, and respect for sovereignty guide our actions. Only then can we create a world where all nations, regardless of their size or power, have a fair opportunity to thrive”.

While underscoring the important and effective role of the regional organizations in shaping the world order, Minister Sabry who also spoke in his capacity as chairman of the Indian Ocean RIM Association (IORA) said “IORA can serve as a platform for fostering regional cooperation and advancing the shared goals of sustainable development and security”.
