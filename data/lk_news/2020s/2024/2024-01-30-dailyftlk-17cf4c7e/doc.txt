USAID, CCC with SLEDB equip officers to boost regional SME exports

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Partnership for Accelerating Results in Trade, National Expenditure, and Revenue (PARTNER) activity, with the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC), have completed an on-the-job coaching program for 50 Development Officers (DOs) attached to the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (SLEDB).

At an award ceremony on 18 January, SLEDB, USAID PARTNER and CCC, recognised the officers for completion of the coaching program, which included a three-day residential program followed by a one-month “self-coaching program” guided by experienced master coaches. The coaching prepared the officers to mentor other DOs attached to the SLEDB tasked with uplifting the export potential of regional small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Sri Lanka.

SLEDB Chairman Dr. Kingsley Bernard stated, “I strongly believe that this program has empowered the EDB Officers and the Development Officers with knowledge to strengthen the capacity of regional SMEs, enabling these businesses to connect with the export value chain and to enter the international market. Finally, this will help improve regional-level export figures and, ultimately, increase the overall income of the country.”

The coaching for 50 DOs is a sustainability initiative, which was delivered as a follow-on to a larger capacity building program supported by USAID PARTNER with CCC as the implementing partner from August 2021-April 2023. In total, 317 DOs attached to EDB across Sri Lanka participated in a five-day curriculum-based classroom training to enhance their ability to support regional SMEs to reach export potential.

“Playing a significant role as the implementing partner of this collaborative initiative underscores the CCC’s commitment to fortifying Sri Lanka’s export landscape, and empowering our SMEs with the knowledge and tools to ensure enhanced competitiveness and sustainable growth,” said CCC Deputy Vice Chairman Bingumal Thewarathanthri.

In Sri Lanka, USAID supports SMEs with direct technical and financial assistance, while working closely with stakeholders to improve the enabling environment that impacts SME competitiveness. USAID Mission Director for Sri Lanka and Maldives Gabriel Grau underscored USAID’s commitment to inclusive private sector-led growth, stating, “Small and medium-sized businesses are at the forefront of businesses affected by Sri Lanka’s economic crisis. The ongoing critical reforms in Sri Lanka are essential for the country to reemerge as a resilient economy, with small businesses continuing to be the engine of commerce and growth. By offering technical assistance, the United States, through USAID, aims to help boost Sri Lankan exports, create jobs, and, ultimately, contribute to putting money back into the pockets of citizens.”
