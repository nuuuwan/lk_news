Global tea convention positions tea as a versatile lifestyle choice

The Colombo International Tea Convention recently brought together a global audience in Colombo to explore the future of the tea industry. A primary focus of the forum was the need to position tea as a versatile lifestyle choice.

Dr. Sharon Hall, Chief Executive of the UK Tea & Infusions Association (UKTIA), provided exclusive insights into the event’s success, the challenges facing the industry, and the emerging trends that are shaping the future of tea.

The convention proved to be a resounding success, with participants from across the globe converging to discuss the future of tea, which the world body on the subject stressed.

Dr. Hall, speaking exclusively to The Island Financial Review highlighted the event’s theme, ‘Tea, A Lifestyle & A Livelihood,’ as central to its success. This theme emphasized the need to position tea as a versatile lifestyle choice and to enhance its value proposition among tea drinkers.

Dr. Hall added: ‘The Convention’s focus on consumption trends and encouraging younger generations to embrace tea aligns perfectly with UKTIA’s mission. By advocating for the health benefits of tea and supporting consumer campaigns, UKTIA aims to bolster tea consumption and adapt to evolving preferences.

‘Key trends discussed at the Convention included health-conscious choices. With a significant portion of young people opting for tea over alcohol, there is a growing trend towards health-conscious drinking. The UK’s younger demographic, particularly 18 to 29-year-olds, prefers tea for its taste and perceived health benefits.

‘Younger consumers are experimenting with tea pairings beyond traditional snacks. This presents an opportunity to introduce tea into various meal contexts.

‘The Convention addressed the gap in out-of-home tea consumption compared to coffee. Enhancing the value and experience of tea in cafes and takeaway settings is a crucial area for growth.

‘The rise of Bubble Tea and spiced chai is driving new consumer interest and could serve as gateways to broader tea consumption. These trends reflect a desire for innovative tea experiences.

‘One of the primary challenges discussed was the perception of tea’s value. As tea producers face increased regulatory and environmental demands, ensuring fair pricing and recognition of these efforts is essential. The Convention highlighted the need for a comprehensive approach to valuing tea that considers all aspects of its production and benefits.

‘The importance of international collaboration in advancing the tea industry was stressed. The Convention served as a platform for fostering partnerships and initiating working groups to address the industry’s challenges and opportunities.

‘With tea already being the second most consumed beverage globally, the future looks promising. UKTIA is preparing for future developments by focusing on sustainability and on enhancing consumer experience.

‘The Colombo International Tea Convention set the stage for a dynamic future for the tea industry. By addressing current trends, challenges, and opportunities, the Convention highlighted the potential for tea to evolve and thrive in the global market. As actions and collaborations from the Convention take shape, the industry looks poised for a bright future, driven by innovation and a renewed appreciation for tea’s diverse offerings.’
