Sri Lanka to restrict railway scrap metal tenders to local bidders

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet has decided to restrict tenders for disposal of scrap metal by state railway and bus companies, to local bidders only, Minister Vijitha Herath said.

Sri Lanka’s cabinet had decided in June 2024 to call international tenders to sell scrap metal.

The two state transport agencies had large volumes of scrap metal, a post-cabinet statement said.

The cabinet had decided to restrict tenders to local buyers to help local industries which needed scrap metal.

The cabinet had approved the proposal by the Minister of Transport, Ports and Civil Aviation to only allow local companies to bid. (Colombo/Oct22/2024)
