Bus strike launched on Avissawella - Colombo route

The employees of the buses operating from Avissawella to Colombo (Route No. 122) have decided to withdraw from their services.

Accordingly, 60 buses operating on route number 122 have been out of service since this morning (Feb. 08).

The bus operators have resorted to this strike action, on account of an alleged assault on the Superintendent of Homagama Bus Depot and a few other employees by a group of individuals while travelling on a bus attached to the depot.

The bus operators also allege that no legal action has been taken against the relevant suspects.
