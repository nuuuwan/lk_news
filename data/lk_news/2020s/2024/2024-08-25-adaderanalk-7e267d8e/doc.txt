‘NPP attempts to build a rich country’: Anura Kumara explains how

Presidential candidate of the National People’s Power (NPP) Anura Kumara Dissanayake states that the NPP is attempting to build a rich country.

Addressing a public rally held in Balangoda, the NPP leader also explained how the country will be developed under an NPP government.

“The country has collapsed completely. But, we guarantee that we will start to develop this country step by step after the 21st of September”, Dissanayake said.

“How do we do that? First of all, the nexus between the politician and the citizen should be strengthened.  Firstly we will inspire a political reformation to earn the trust of the voters who didn’t vote in our favour. We will set that example.”

“For a long time, we were governed by governments that were built upon families, relations and friends. However, under an NPP-led government, we will only give positions to those who are qualified for the job. We will not consider political connections or family relationships”, he added.

“Don’t we need a country like that? Now, we are attempting to build a rich country - a wonderful life”, the NPP’s presidential candidate said.
