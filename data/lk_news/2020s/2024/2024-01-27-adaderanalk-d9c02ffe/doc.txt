Exam centre chief arrested over 2023 A/L exam paper leak

The Criminal Investigations Department (CID) has arrested another individual on suspicion of his involvement in the incident of several questions of the 2023 G.C.E. Advanced Level examination’s Agricultural Science I & II question papers allegedly being leaked prior to the test.

The arrested female suspect was the chief at the A/L examination centre established at the Moratuwa Maha Vidyalaya, the police said.

Police mentioned that she served as a teacher advisor attached to the Piliyandala Zonal Education Office.

Last week, the CID also arrested a 38-year-old man who had served as the peon of the female exam centre chief in question and a 52-year-old A/L Agricultural Science teacher of a popular government school in Ampara on suspicion of being involved in the incident.

The three suspects have been remanded in custody until February 02, 2024, after being produced before the Ampara Magistrate’s Court.

The Department of Examinations said the CID is conducting further investigations regarding the incident.

On January 12, the Department of Examinations decided to cancel the 2023 G.C.E. Advanced Level examination’s Agricultural Science I & II question papers, due to reports that several questions of the paper had been leaked prior to the exam.

Accordingly, the relevant test paper, which students sat for on 10 January, was deemed invalid by the Examinations Department on account of numerous questions included in the paper having been leaked before the exam date.

After annulling both question papers, fresh date and time have been announced for the relevant exam paper:

Earlier, the Department said that the admission card for school applicants for this exam would be sent to the respective school principals, while admission cards for private applicants are mailed to them.
