Suspect arrested over temple shooting that killed a Buddhist monk

A man has been arrested on suspicion of his involvement in the killing of a Buddhist monk at a temple in the Malwathuhiripitiya area last month.

The arrest was made by the Western/North Crimes Division during a late-night operation conducted yesterday.

In addition, the T-56 rifle used by the perpetrators was also recovered from the possession of the 29-year-old suspect.

A group of four assailants, who had arrived in a car, shot dead a Buddhist monk inside a temple in the Malwathuhiripitiya area of Gampaha in the early hours of January 23.

The 45-year-old Buddhist monk, Ven. Kalapaluwawe Dhammarathana Thero, who sustained critical injuries in the incident, had been rushed to the Gampaha Hospital. But he later succumbed to injuries while receiving treatment.
