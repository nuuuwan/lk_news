Sri Lanka sets 161-run target for Afghanistan in first T20I

Dambulla, Feb 17 (Daily Mirror) - In the inaugural T20I match at Dambulla today, Sri Lanka posted a challenging total of 160 runs for Afghanistan to chase down.

Despite early setbacks, skipper Wanindu Hasaranga's resilient innings of 67 runs provided a much-needed boost to the Sri Lankan innings.

Opting to bowl first after winning the toss, Afghanistan's decision seemed justified as they struck early, dismissing opener Pathum Nissanka cheaply.

Sri Lanka were four wickets down for just 55 runs when Hasaranga walked in.

Hasaranga's aggressive approach, featuring three sixes and seven boundaries, propelled Sri Lanka's total to a competitive score.

For Afghanistan, Fazalhaq Farooqi was the pick of the bowlers, picking up three wickets for 25 runs. Naveen-ul-Haq and Azmatullah Omarzai also chipped in with two wickets each.
