Singapore team to help improve Sri Lanka immigration system

ECONOMYNEXT – A six-member delegation from Singapore’s Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) is in Sri Lanka to conduct a comprehensive study of airport and immigration department operation systems.

“The purpose of this visit is to provide cooperation to improve Sri Lanka’s immigration system by achieving the same standards as Singapore and integrating advanced technology,” the Ministry of Public Security said in a statement.

“This will greatly contribute to Sri Lanka’s efforts to modernize and improve all processes related to immigration, visa issuance and citizenship.”

The team, who are  here after Minister Tiran Alas requested Singapore Minister for Law K Shanmugam’s help, will provide a detailed report on recommendations to bring the existing system on par with that of Singapore.

Sri Lanka recently controversially outsourced its visa handling function to VFS Global, which requires the payment of “processing” and “convenience” charges of 26 dollars, even though the government does not collect any fees.

Maldivian authorities have reminded Sri Lanka of the long-standing bilateral agreement under which their citizens could travel freely between the two neighbours without any charges or bureaucratic barriers.

Singapore is another country which could take action against Sri Lanka if the bilateral deal is found to be violated, according a source said.

There are only a handful of countries to which Sri Lankan passport holders can travel without any visa restrictions. (Colombo/May30/2024)
