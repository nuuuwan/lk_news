Upcountry plantation workers launch strike; demand Rs. 1,700 daily wage

Hatton, April 21 (Daily Mirror)- UpcountryÂ  plantation workers launched a strike and staged a protest today demanding that their daily wages be increased to Rs. 1,700.

The plantation workers displayed black flags and wore back bands during their protest.

Trade associations in Hatton, Kotagala, Bogawanthalawa, Dikoya and Maskeliya closed down their shops and displayed black flags in support of the strike action.

The Ceylon Workers' Congress organised the trade union action and other trade unions such as the Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) extended their support to the strike.

The protesting plantation workers claim that the plantation companies had not taken any steps to increase their wages despite massive profits earned by the companies.
