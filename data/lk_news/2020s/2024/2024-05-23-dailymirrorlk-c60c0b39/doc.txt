Customs will begin auction preparations next week

Colombo, May 23 (Daily Mirror) - Preliminary work related to conducting all auctions in the Customs Department will be started next week, Finance State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

He pointed out that all parties can participate in the relevant auctions from home without any influence.
