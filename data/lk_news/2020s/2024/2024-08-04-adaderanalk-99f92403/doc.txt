Paris Olympics: Sri Lanka’s Aruna Darshana advances to 400m semi-finals

Sri Lankan sprinter Aruna Darshana has qualified for the semifinals of the Men’s 400m event at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games after finishing third in the Heat race.

Darshana finished 3rd in the Men’s 400m Heat 5 with a timing of 44.99 seconds, his personal best, and qualified for the semifinals which are scheduled to be held on Tuesday (Aug. 06).

Kirani James (44.78) of Grenada placed first in Heat 5 while Canada’s Christopher Morales-Williams came second with a time of 44.96 seconds.

Aruna Darshana recently showcased his exceptional speed and skill on the track achieving an impressive first-place finish in the Men’s 400m event at the 2nd Belt and Road Invitational Athletics Championship held in China.

He has been tipped by many to follow in the footsteps of former Sri Lankan athlete Sugath Thilakaratne. Darshana won the men’s 400m event during the 2018 National Athletics Championships by clocking a time of 46.16 seconds.
