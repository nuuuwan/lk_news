University non-academic staff to continue strike action

The University Trade Union Joint Committee (UTUJC) has announced that university non-academic employees will continue their trade union action.

UTUJC Co-Chairman Dhammika S. Priyantha emphasized that the issue cannot be resolved by merely appointing committees.

“We expected a positive response to the two Cabinet memorandums sent to address long-standing issues in the university system. Instead, another committee has been appointed,” Priyantha stated.

“We went on strike for 27 days, not to see another committee formed. These demands have been accepted as reasonable through previous reports. We have yet to receive an answer from the government, so the union leaders have decided to continue the trade union action,” he added.
