Doing it with Pumpkin

You will need 01 small slice of pumpkin (let’s say ½ cup), 01 raw egg, ½ teaspoon honey, and ½ teaspoon apple cider vinegar

All you need to do is to puree the pumpkin in a food processor, until smooth. Once that is done, add in the egg, honey, and apple cider vinegar and blend.

Okay, now apply this mixture to your clean face and keep it for 15 to 20 minutes. Finally, rinse and apply your usual skin care products.

You will need ½ cup pureed pumpkin, ½ cup organic brown sugar, 01 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, 01 tablespoon honey, and 02 drops of vanilla extract.

Put the pureed pumpkin in a food processor, then add in the remaining ingredients, and mix together.

In the shower, apply the scrub on dry skin and gently rub to exfoliate dead skin cells. Finally, rinse off the remaining scrub in the shower. Wow! Your skin will instantly feel smoother.

You will need 02 cups of chopped and cooked pumpkin, 01 tablespoon coconut oil, 01 tablespoon honey, and 01 tablespoon yoghurt.

Blend the pumpkin and yoghurt until smooth and then add the coconut oil and honey. Once everything is blended, apply this mixture to shampooed hair and let it remain for 10-15 minutes. Finally, rinse your hair thoroughly.

(Oh, by the way, to treat dark spots and pigmentation, mix 01 tablespoon of pumpkin puree, 01 teaspoon honey, 01 teaspoon of freshly squeezed lemon juice, and 01 teaspoon of vitamin E oil. Leave this mask on for 30 minutes and then rinse off with warm water.)
