19-year-old dies after allegedly jumping from flyover to expressway

A youth is suspected to have jumped to his death from a flyover to the Outer Circular Highway in Colombo last night (24).

The 19-year-old male had died after falling from the flyover near the 1.2km post of the Outer Circular Highway in Colombo on to the expressway at around 7.00 p.m. last night.

At the time, he had collided with a car heading towards Matara, police said.

The youth, who was seriously injured in the accident, was pronounced dead after being admitted to Homagama Base Hospital for treatment.

However, police state that the incident has occurred under suspicious circumstances as they believe the deceased may have attempted to take his own life.

The deceased, a 19-year-old resident of the Athurugiriya area, was following a course at a private university in Padukka, the police said.

The vehicle, in which the deceased had come into contact with, was also damaged in the incident while the police have arrested the driver of the car.

Meanwhile, during the investigations carried out by the police, a note suspected to have been written by the deceased youth was also found in his home indicating that he intends to take his own life.
