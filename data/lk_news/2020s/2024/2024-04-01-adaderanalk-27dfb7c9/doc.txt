Management and daily operations of expressways handed over to private sector

The daily operations and management of the countryâ€™s expressways have been officially handed over to the private sector under a formal management agreement, with effect from today (April 01).

Furthermore, all relevant assets will reportedly be transferred to the private sector within six months, following a legal and financial feasibility study jointly carried out by the Road Development Authority (RDA) and the private sector.

Minister of Transport Bandula Gunawardena had submitted the Cabinet paper pertaining to the matter to the Cabinet of Ministers on March 25, 2024.

Accordingly, the expressway network, lands owned by the expressway, and the related staff will be transferred to the relevant private-sector company, enabling them to manage the expressway network in a more commercial manner.
