Sri Lanka to partner with India for digital transformation

Sri Lanka is set to strengthen its digital transformation efforts by leveraging India’s expertise in e-governance, financial technology (FinTech) strategies, artificial intelligence (AI) and digital infrastructure.

The Cabinet of Ministers has approved a proposal by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in his capacity as the Digital Economy Minister to formalise this collaboration through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with India’s Electronics and Information Technology Ministry.

“The proposed MoU aims to enhance institutional cooperation between the two countries, focusing on capacity building for Government officials in Sri Lanka and the implementation of innovative digital solutions,” Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday. The collaboration is expected to address gaps in technical expertise and accelerate the implementation of digital transformation strategies and solutions.

He added this initiative also aligns with the Government’s broader vision of building a digitally inclusive and innovation-driven economy.
