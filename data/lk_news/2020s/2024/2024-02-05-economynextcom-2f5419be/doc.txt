Sri Lanka SEC launches webpage to report dodgy social media

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Securities and Exchange Commission said it had started a webpage to report “suspected market related wrongdoing on social media.”

“With the rapid evolution of communication channels and the increase of social media influence in the financial markets, the SEC recognized the need for proactive measures to identify and address potential social media wrongdoings that may impact investors and market stability,” SEC Deputy Director General Tushara Jayaratne was quoted in the statement.

“Considering these developments, the SEC has taken a significant step towards enhancing investor protection and market integrity with the launch of a dedicated webpage to report suspected market related wrongdoing on social media.”

The webpage offers a user–friendly, confidential process for submitting information related to potential market manipulation, fraudulent activities, and other securities-related misconduct.

The SEC hopes this would encourage “investors, market participants, and concerned citizens, to play an active role in maintaining the integrity of the securities market.” (Colombo/Feb5/2024)
