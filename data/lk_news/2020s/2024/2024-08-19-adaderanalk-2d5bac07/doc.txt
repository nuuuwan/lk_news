New luxury airport shuttle service suspended after just 4 days

The new luxury shuttle service which was recently launched to provide passenger transport services from the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) to the Colombo Fort Railway Station and the Multimodal Transport Centre (MMC) in Makumbura, has been temporally suspended effective from today (August 19).

The relevant luxury bus service was initiated on August 15, however, it had faced immediate protests on the very same day.

Specifically, the Airport-Fort Bus Employees’ Union had launched a bus strike on August 16 against the newly-initiated luxury airport shuttle service.

In addition to this, the union had also lodged complaints with the Ministry of Transport and Highways as well as the Election Commission.

The BIA taxi service associations had also expressed their support to the protest campaigns.

Accordingly, after considering the concerns put forward, it has been decided to temporarily suspend the ‘Airport Terminal Shuttle Service’ after only four days of operation.

President of the Airport-Fort Bus Employees’ Union, Indika Gunasekara said that instead of the suspended luxury shuttle service, it is expected to allocate ten of the union’s buses from the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) to the Colombo Fort Railway Station and the Multimodal Transport Centre (MMC) in Makumbura.
