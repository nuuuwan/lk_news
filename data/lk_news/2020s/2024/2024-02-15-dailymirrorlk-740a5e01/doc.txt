Electricity tariff must be reduced by 28 to 33%: NPP tells PUCSL

Colombo, Feb. 15 (Daily Mirror)- Claiming that the proposed electricity tariff revision by about 3 percent is not at all sufficient, the National People's Power (NPP) said the tariffs should be reduced by at least 28 to 33 percent.

Making submissions during the public hearing at the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PCUSL) with regard to the proposed electricity tariff revision, former NPP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said people must receive an electricity tariff revision of at least 28 to 33 percent.

He said the CEB's new proposal to reduce electricity tariff by some 3 percent is not at all satisfactory and added that the CEB in its new proposal had submitted some unacceptable increase in expenditure.

Dr. Jayatissa said the PUCSL should not take decisions solely based on the CEB's information and that the Commission should take steps to ensure justice to the consumers.

"The PUCSL has been constituted by a Parliamentary Act. The Commission should exercise its powers to mete out justice to the consumers by using its expertise knowledge without solely based on information provided by the CEB," he said.
