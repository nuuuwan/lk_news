A show not to be missed, says Suzi

Singer Suzie Croner, who is now a popular figure in the entertainment scene, in her hometown of Zurich, in Switzerland, was in contact with The Island to elaborate on her plans when she travels to Australia later this month for ‘Country Night’ to be held in Melbourne on 26th October.

Referring to last week’s article ‘More excitement for Sri Lankans in Melbourne’, Suzi said that it’s certainly going to be a happening scene on 26th October.

“I wasn’t 100 percent fit when I last performed in Australia, and that was in October 2023.

“I fell sick and had a bad throat, but I still sang, and, jokingly, she added: “Perhaps I would have sounded like those roosters crowing in the morning cock-a-doodle-doo!”

“I was in bed for 11 days, but I did perform as I couldn’t disappoint the crowd; the show had to go on.

“This time, however, I’m raring to go and I’m going to give country music lovers something extra special and I want to see all my Sri Lankan friends, living in Melbourne, at The Grand On Princess on Saturday, 26th October.

“I guarantee it’s going to be a show full of excitement…and memories.

“I would also be performing to my own music and that would give me the freedom to do things my own way, to keep the crowd entertained.”
