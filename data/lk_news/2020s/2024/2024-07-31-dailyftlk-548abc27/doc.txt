Cabinet approves to gazette Bill to amend National Transport Commission Act

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the publication of a new Bill to amend the National Transport Commission Act in the Government Gazette, with plans to subsequently table it in Parliament for approval.

This development follows the decision made at the Cabinet meeting held on 22 September 2022, to amend the National Transport Commission Act No. 37 of 1991.

“The Bill prepared by the Legal Draftsman has received clearance from the Attorney General,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

He said the proposed amendments aim to extend the regulatory authority of the National Transport Commission (NTC) to include the pricing of three-wheelers, office vans and school vans.

“The current price regulation, which is limited to buses, will now be expanded to cover three wheelers, school vans and staff transportation. This move is intended to bring more comprehensive oversight and ensure fair pricing across various modes of transportation,” he added.
