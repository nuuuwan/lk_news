PM Hasina says ‘Anarchists’ tried to create SL-type Aragalaya in Bangla

Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has accused groups she referred to as ‘anarchists’ of trying to create Sri Lanka-type mayhem in the country during the recent quota reform movement. She has claimed they had planned to topple the Government.

“Actually, they planned to create a Sri Lanka-type violence and oust the Government,” she said when Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Pranay Verma called on her at her official residence Ganabhaban this week.

According to Bangladeshi news reports the Prime Minister had told Verma that the recent movement centring on quota reform was not a normal movement at all, rather at one stage it turned into almost a terrorist-like attack.

Hasina, who sanctioned a brutal crackdown on the protestors has called for the people involved in the violence to be brought to justice.

The unrest which took place in Bangladesh in mid-July killed at least 150 people, injured several thousand people and damaged major Government agencies.

The protests subsided after the apex Appellate Division of unitary Bangladesh’s Supreme Court on 21 July ordered a massive quota reform, keeping only seven% of reserve posts instead of the existing 56%.
