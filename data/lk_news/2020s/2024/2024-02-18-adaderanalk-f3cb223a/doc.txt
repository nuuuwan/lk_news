‘Now is the time to end traditional politics’ – Dilith Jayaweera

Leader of the Mawbima Janatha Party (MJP), entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera says the time has come to end traditional politics in the country.

Speaking at the party’s district conference in Colombo, held at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium on Saturday (17 Feb.), Mr. Jayaweera said he intends to bring the change the country needs.

“I am not someone who expected to get into politics, but throughout my university life, and afterwards, I supported various political parties and figures hoping for one thing, and that is the hope that they will, some day, make the country that we love, a better country. But, we were continuously, let down, so as a result, ultimately we decided that we ourselves would come and make that change. That is what we are here for,” he stated.

Former Governor of the Eastern Province Anuradha Yahampath, Deputy Chairman of the Communist Party of Sri Lanka MP Weerasumana Weerasinghe, former MP Piyasiri Wijenayake, diplomat Palitha Kohona, Sri Lankan racing champion Dilantha Malagamuwa and former sprinter Shehan Ambepitiya were present at the event, among other dignitaries.
