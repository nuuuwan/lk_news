Sri Lanka Treasuries yields rise, 3-month up 50bp

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Treasuries yields rose across maturities at Wednesday’s auction, with all 230 billion rupees offered volume sold.

The three-month yield rose 50 basis points to 9.39 percent, with 91.6 billion rupees of bills sold after offering 25 billion.

The six-month yield rose 51 basis points to 9.81 percent, with 95.03 billion rupees raised after offering 90 billion.

The 12-month yield rose 36 basis points to 9.90 percent with 43.3 billion rupees of bills after offering 65 billion.

Sri Lanka’s interest rates eased amid a build-up of excess liquidity from dollar purchases.

Unsterilized liquidity, leads to a faster fall in rates than if the liquidity was mopped up to lock in reserves.

Unsterilized liquidity also requires the currency to be defended to prevent a loss of credibility of the exchange rate through a so-called ‘flexible’ exchange rate, and mild panic among importers who will cover early, instead of using informal suppliers’ credit.

Excess liquidity has since fallen, though the  central bank is also injecting cash. Some term cash has was also injected below the overnight rate. (Colombo/June18/2024)
