Drug traffickers behind recent incidents at Kandakadu rehab centre?

Rehabilitation Commissioner General Major General (Retd.) Darshana Hettiarachchi, has revealed that stricter and immediate measures are underway to curtail the frequent conflicts being reported from within the Kandakadu Treatment and Rehabilitation Centre.

Hettiarachchi further explained that the admission of drug traffickers into the rehabilitation centre, resulting in drug peddling rackets within the Kandakadu Camp, has been identified as the main cause behind these frequent conflicts.

He assured, however, that while the situation has been contained for now, a long-term solution is required for the issue.

For this month alone, two incidents of such conflicts were reported from the Kandakadu Rehabilitation Centre, with a total of over 100 inmates having escaped from the facility.
