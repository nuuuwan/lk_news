Sri Lanka Tax ID Fines On Hold

COLOMBO (News 1st); The Inland Revenue Department has temporarily suspended imposing fines on individuals who have not obtained their Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) or tax registration number, according to the instructions of the Ministry of Finance.

The government had previously announced that every citizen above the age of 18 must open a tax file, and it was planned to be made mandatory from January 1, 2024.

When asked about the matter, Nihal Wijewardena, Deputy Commissioner of the Inland Revenue Department, stated that those who did not obtain the relevant number by February 1, 2024, will not be fined.
