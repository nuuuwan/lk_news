Programme initiated to manufacture artificial limbs

The Sri Lanka Army, in bilateral cooperation with the High Commission of India in Sri Lanka, yesterday initiated a programme to manufacture artificial limbs at the Ranaviru Sevana, Ragama.

This endeavour not only signifies the enduring bond between Sri Lanka and India but also reflects a collective commitment to support those who have made sacrifices for the nation's security and are now confronting challenges due to disabilities.
