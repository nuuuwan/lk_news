We, as a coalition of civil society organisations advocating for the well-being of Children in the country, urge all the Candidates at the 2024 Presidential Elections in Sri Lanka to step up to ensure tangible, timely, and relevant actions in their next government to achieve the aspired impact of development and inclusive societies through the right policy, investment, and action for protecting Children.

As the upcoming election draws near, we write to you with an urgent appeal to prioritise the protection and well-being of our children in your campaign and future administration. The challenges facing our children are vast and pressing, and it is crucial that we address them with both urgency and precision.

Children are our society›s most delicate and precious members, and they need to be cared for, protected, nurtured, and empowered and hold equal status as any human being. Their well-being, safety, and development are crucial for a prosperous future. In light of increasing concerns about child safety, we propose a comprehensive proposal to ensure that every child has the opportunity to grow up in a secure, healthy, and supportive environment. This proposal outlines a multi-faceted approach to child protection, encompassing legislative measures, family and community initiatives, and educational programs.
