Honouring the Unsung Heroes of Sri Lanka on International Women’s Day

As we celebrate International Women’s Day, it prompts us to wonder, what does it truly mean to be a woman? In a world marked by increasing competitiveness and relentless pace, women often find themselves questioning their place and value. Today, as we honour the spirit of womanhood, it is imperative to recognise the enduring legacy of women and address the scarcity of female role models to inspire the next generation.

Being a woman is a profound journey, marked by the diverse roles of daughter, wife, mother, educator, career woman and a caregiver to her family. From the moment a child is cradled protectively in her womb, she begins a journey of nurturing and guidance that extends far beyond birth. A mother’s love envelops her child, shaping their perceptions and experiences as they navigate the world.

Sri Lanka, throughout its history, has boasted a rich culture where women have consistently woven threads of societal progress with subtlety and resilience. From the reign of Queen Anula, the first queen in Sri Lankan history and the first documented female head of state in Asia, to the present-day leaders in various fields, women have made remarkable contributions. Despite their significant influence, their accomplishments have often gone unnoticed, primarily due to a lack of recorded history and recognition of their contributions. While it’s important to celebrate these women it is imperative for our nation to honour and immortalise these resilient women, inspiring future generations to follow their strength and legacy.

The absence of recognition for the outstanding achievements of exceptional women results in a lack of inspiration for young girls. Without sufficient inspiration, there is a notable absence of motivation to propel them forward. Sri Lanka has been shaped by the collective wisdom and leadership of countless women. However, in Colombo, the lack of female representation in public monuments is glaring, with men frequently depicted in positions of prominence, while women are often marginalised. Lifebuoy Shampoo, a brand dedicated to empowering girls, shines a spotlight on the heart of this matter.

In Sri Lanka, women have made notable contributions across a spectrum of fields including education, healthcare, science and technology, business, politics, and governance. Yet, it’s disheartening that many of these accomplished women continue to go unnoticed and unacknowledged in Sri Lankan society. Unilever sheds light on this concerning trend, emphasising that the absence of influential female role models in the lives of today’s youth has led to a situation where women struggle to recognize their rightful place and value in society.

Renowned as the queen of Sri Lankan cinema, Malini Fonseka brilliantly captured the essence of women’s empowerment with her profound words, “Empowerment is not about giving women power, it’s about reminding them that they already have it.” This sentiment emphasizes the profound impact of women believing in themselves and uplifting one another all aligns with a reminder that they are capable by showing how women of the past have dared to dream and achieved extraordinary goals.

To be a woman is to embody resilience, grace, and compassion, while possessing the strength to conquer daunting obstacles. Countless women have defied societal stigmas of their time, making significant contributions as they navigate various leadership roles. They serve as beacons of determination, shaping a future that is both brighter and more inclusive for all.

To change the narrative, it is important to understand the significance of nurturing strength and self-confidence in young girls by celebrating the achievements of women, which will equip young girls with the inspiration to thrive in a rapidly evolving society and when women are afforded equal appreciation, they become catalysts for innovation, drivers of economic growth, and advocates for social justice.

By celebrating the achievements of women and amplifying their voices, we pave the way for a more inclusive and equitable society, where gender does not hinder opportunity but enriches our collective experience.

In essence, celebrating and immortalising a woman is not only a moral imperative but also a strategic investment in the future prosperity and well-being of our nation. It is imperative that we recognise the pivotal role women play in shaping societies and economies. Let us embrace the responsibility to ensure that future generations inherit a world where gender equality is not a distant aspiration but a lived reality, where every individual, regardless of gender, has the opportunity to thrive and contribute fully. By doing so, we forge a path towards a brighter, more equitable future for all, where the potential of every individual is realised and celebrated.
