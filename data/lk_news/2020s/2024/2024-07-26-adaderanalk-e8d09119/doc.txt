Women’s Asia Cup: Sri Lanka beat Pakistan to set up final with India

Sri Lanka women’s cricket team defeated Pakistan by three wickets in the second semi-final of the Women’s T20 Asia Cup 2024 which was played at Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium on Friday.

The hosts chased down the 141-run target in the last over which was bowled by Pakistan’s skipper Nida Dar.

Sri Lanka needed three off six balls in the last over but Dar’s impressive display made it somewhat difficult for the home side. However, the Pakistani skipper ended up bowling a wide ball which changed the game in the hosts’ favour.

During their chase, Sri Lanka suffered initially as they lost two of their batters Vishmi Gunaratne and Harshitha Samarawickrama and were 19-2 in just four overs.

However, skipper Chamari Athapaththu played a leader’s knock which guided Sri Lanka near to victory. She scored 63 runs on 48 balls with 10 boundaries.

Down the order, Anushka Sanjeewani provided crucial 24 runs and the Islanders chased the target with one ball to spare.

For Pakistan, Sadia Iqbal bagged four wickets while Dar and Omaima Sohail took one each.

Sri Lanka will now face India in the final on July 28 in Dambulla.
