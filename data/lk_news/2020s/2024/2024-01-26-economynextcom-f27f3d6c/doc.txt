Sri Lanka Police to take street children into custody

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka Police said it will continue to take street children into the State’s custody and eventually place them with a suitable guardian, a DIG said.

“An operation to take street children into custody in 2023 saw us take into custody 102 street kids who were used for begging,” Deputy Inspector General of Police Renuka Jayasundara said at a press briefing.

“We were able to place them with suitable guardians. We will continue this operation in 2024,” she added.

The Police has also introduced a 109 hotline for child and female victims of any form of abuse to reach out to them.

“This line is handled by female officers who will protect your privacy,” Jayasundara said, pointing out that victims of abuse usually avoid going to a Police station because of the treatment they are meted out.

The government was improving laws to curb child molestation and compiling a sex offender list, officials said at the briefing. (Colombo/Jan26/2024)
