Suspect arrested for defrauding money promising jobs in UK

A person has been arrested today (18) by the Special Investigation Unit of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) in connection with a foreign employment scam after he allegedly cheated millions of rupees by promising employment opportunities in the United Kingdom (UK).

The investigations have revealed that the institution that was operating in the Colombo 02 area was an unlicensed foreign employment agency, without the necessary authorisation from the SLBFE and the owner of the institution, identified as ‘Samanture Jinna’, had fraudulently obtained Rs. 4 million per person by promising teaching assistant and restaurant jobs in the UK.

Accordingly, the suspect was arrested in the Dehiwala area by the Special Investigations Unit of the SLBFE, following a complaint claiming that the person in question had swindled money from them under the pretence of providing foreign employment opportunities.

The bureau said it is receiving complaints against the suspect and the Special Investigation Unit is conducting further investigations in this regard.

The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) requested foreign job seekers to verify on the www.slbfe.lk website or by contacting the 1989 hotline whether the agency holds a valid license for recruiting for foreign employment and even if the agency is legitimate whether they have received the specific job order, before providing money or a passport to any organization or individual promising overseas employment.
