Supreme Court rules Diana Gamage ineligible for parliamentary seat

Colombo, May 08 - The Supreme Court in another landmark judgment today held that State Minister Diana Gamage is disqualified to be a Member of Parliament and is thus not entitled to hold office as a Member of Parliament, as she was not a citizen of Sri Lanka.

With this Supreme Court judgment, Diana Gamage’s disqualification will lead to the loss of her parliamentary seat.

The Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprised  Justices Gamini Amarasekara, Kumuduni Wickremasinghe and Janak de Silva.

Counsel Hafeel Farisz with Nishika Fonseka and Shannon Thilekaratne appeared for Petitioner Oshala Herath.
