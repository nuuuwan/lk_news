Japan gives bikes to Sri Lanka schoolchildren

ECONOMYNEXT – Japan has donated 517 bicycles to rural schoolchildren in Sri Lanka to help them get to school daily.

“To encourage safe and daily attendance of school in rural areas, 517 bicycles were donated by the people of Japan through ChildFund Japan,” ChildFund Sri Lanka said in a statement.

Schoolchildren between the ages of 12-16 were selected from 108 schools in 12 districts where there are transportation difficulties, such as Monaragala, Puttalam, and Mullaitivu.

Some students in these areas have to travel over two and a half kilometers from home to school with no means of transport available.

The bicycles were handed over to the Ministry of Education, Sri Lanka on Monday with Ambassador Mizukoshi Hideaki and Minister of Education Susil Premajayantha participating. The bicycles will be distributed to the selected schools and children by ChildFund Sri Lanka. (Colombo/Apr2/2024)
