China-Sri Lanka Trade: MOU signed to align export standards

Sri Lanka’s Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena has called for closer economic cooperation with China. He made the comments during an official visit to Shanghai on Friday. China’s national Quality Certification Center and Sri Lanka’s Bureau of Standards signed an MOU to better align trade standards. China is Sri Lanka’s second-largest trading partner and the country’s second-largest source of imports.

Dinesh Gunawardena, Sri Lankan Prime Minister said: “We have to abide by the quality requirements that are needed. Therefore, China’s advanced quality requirements for Sri Lankan exports into China will also need more cooperation and working together for which so many discussions have been held. We hope this area will be able to pursue faster so that Sri Lankan products could come into China on the approved agreements and approved standards.”

Meanwhile, Xie Zhaoxun, Managing Director of China Quality Certification Center said: “Conformity assessment is a globally acknowledged quality management tool and trade facilitator. We firmly anticipate this partnership to further facilitate China-Sri Lanka technical exchange on conformity assessment and economic and trade exchanges.”
