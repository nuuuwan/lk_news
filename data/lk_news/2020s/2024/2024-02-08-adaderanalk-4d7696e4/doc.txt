CEB, Rividhanavi ink agreement for 100MW Ground Mount Solar project

The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) on Thursday (Feb.08) inked a power purchase agreement with Rividhanavi (Pvt) Ltd. for the 100MW Ground Mount Solar project in Siyambalanduwa.

The deal was signed in the presence of Power & Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera.

In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Wijesekera said the investment is expected to be USD 132 million.

The project was advertised by the state-owned electricity supplier in September 2022, evaluated in 2023, and awarded to the lowest and most successful bidder by the end of 2023.

The minister said Rividhanavi would also build the transmission line of 27.5km for the project and transfer it to the CEB.

Rividhanavi (Pvt) Ltd. is a consortium of shareholders, Lakdhanavi Ltd., Windforce PLC and The Blue Circle PTE Ltd of Singapore, he added.
