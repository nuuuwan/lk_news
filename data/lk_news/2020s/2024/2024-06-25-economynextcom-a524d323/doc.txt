Sri Lanka apparel showcased in London under ‘Your Vital Island’ brand

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s textile and apparel industry has showcased the country as a sourcing destination at an exhibition in the United Kingdom, the Export Development Board said.

The primary goal of Sri Lanka’s participation in the exhibition is to discover new buyers and provide a boost to the country’s apparel export sector aiming to increase apparel exports to the United Kingdom by a billion dollar in 2026, the EDB said.

Sri Lanka unveiled its “Your Vital Island” brand to reaffirm its “dedication to meeting global standards while preserving its distinctive identity.”

“It signals a promise of unparalleled quality, unique products, and customized services, all delivered with genuine authenticity.”

The export promotion programme titled “Sourced Sri Lanka” was organized by the EDB, Sri Lanka Apparel Sourcing Association (SLASA), Sri Lanka High Commission in the UK, and Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF).

40 Sri Lankan exhibitors representing apparel, textile and accessory industries participated at the event held on June 17-18, at the Royal Horticultural Hall in London, United Kingdom.

Parallel events such as fashion shows, panel discussions and guest speaker sessions were also held. (Colombo/Jun25/2024)
