Sri Lanka SEC approves scholars to certify Islamic securities

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Securities and Exchange Commission said it had approved six scholars to certify Islamic Financial Products that are to be public listed.

These accredited Shariah scholars are authorized to certify the Shariah compliance of Islamic Capital Market Products intended for listing on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) in accordance with the Listing Rules.

“The SEC considers this as an essential step in view of products that require Shariah compatibility and to satisfy the needs of Islamic investors,” Deputy Director General Tushara Jayaratne said in a statement.
