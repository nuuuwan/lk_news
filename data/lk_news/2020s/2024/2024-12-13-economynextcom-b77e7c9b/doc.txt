Sri Lanka Port City Economic Commission gets new chairman, members

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s President Anura Dissanayake has appointed Harsha Amarasekera PC as chairman of the Port City Economic Commission.

Other members include Damien Amal Cabraal, Mohan Ray Abeywardena, Sanjaya Kulatunga, and Dr Harsha Subasinghe, the president’s media division said.

Sri Lanka’s China-backed Colombo Port City Economic Commission Bill was passed in 2021.

The Colombo Port City Commission approves large investments such as those that invest in building as primary businesses of strategic importance which get investment incentives.

The Colombo Port City is a dollarized special economic zone which will be free of central bank liquidity tools and therefore free of currency crises. (Colombo/Dec13/2024)
