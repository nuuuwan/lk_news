Sri Lanka minister, banks discuss loans for estate community

ECONOMYNEXT – Two of Sri Lanka’s banks have agreed to provide housing loans for the estate community to build houses once they are given land ownership, Minister of Estate Infrastructure Jeevan Thondaman, said.

“…They are to utilize this land as collateral not just for housing but for their children’s education and so many others,” Thondaman told reporters this week.

“We have spoken to two priority banks in the country and they have agreed that once land rights are given, they will be eligible for a housing loan which will be at a subsidized rate for the estate dwellers.”

Earlier this year, Thondaman said that only 8 percent of families in the plantation sector own homes compared with the national average of 86 percent.

However, Thondaman said that in order for those living on estates to have houses, their livelihoods should increase, as costs of electricity and water also come with home ownership.

“There have been many instances where estate workers who build houses sell their houses and have gone back to the land.”

Sri Lanka to create villages, provide land for 176,000 families living in plantations

Sri Lanka’s cabinet has approved the drafting of a law to create village communities in areas where people, mainly descendants of former plantation workers, are resident in plantations.

There are about 115,000 workers employed in plantations, but a total of about 987,000 persons are living in the plantations, made up mostly descendants of former workers.
