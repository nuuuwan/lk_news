Daintee, the confectionary arm of Sunshine Consumer Lanka Ltd. (SCL), recently marked its 40th anniversary, highlighting four decades of excellence in crafting delicious sweets and confectionery delights for millions of Sri Lankans. The grand celebration, which took place on 1 April 2024, was graced by Sunshine Holdings Deputy Chairman Vish Govindasamy, Sunshine Consumer Lanka Chief Executive Officer Anuruddha Aluvihare, senior management of Sunshine Holdings and SCL, Daintee employees, and other distinguished guests.

Established in 1984 through a collaboration with UK confectionary giant Barker and Dobson, Daintee has since emerged as a market leader, captivating consumers’ hearts and taste buds across Sri Lanka. The company’s extensive product range includes toffees, sweets, jellies, chocolates, cocoa-based confectionery, bubblegum, desserts, biscuits, and snacks. Daintee maintains a 40% market share in toffees and sweets.

In 2020, Sunshine Holdings acquired Daintee to expand its presence in Sri Lanka’s fast-growing FMCG segment by extending its portfolio beyond tea. Additionally, the acquisition aligned with the Group’s strategy to nurture and build local brands. Daintee has been a part of SCL’s growing portfolio of businesses that markets and distributes some of the country’s most-loved tea brands—Watawala, Zesta and Ran Kahata.

Commenting on this significant milestone, Sunshine Holdings Deputy Chairman Vish Govindasamy said, “Daintee is one of the most loved brands in Sri Lanka, and it makes everybody smile. Daintee’s enduring legacy and commitment to quality and trust have made it a household name cherished by generations of Sri Lankan consumers. This milestone is a testament to our talented employees’ dedication and hard work, who have contributed to the company’s growth and success, making Daintee a super brand in Sri Lanka.”

During the event, Daintee announced that it has earned ISO 22000:2018 certification for its food safety management system implemented within its manufacturing facility in Anura Mawatha, Ratmalana. This certification, conferred by Control Union Inspections Ltd., underscores Daintee’s commitment to ensuring the highest food quality and safety standards across its extensive product range.

Expressing his views on Daintee’s trajectory during the next 40 years, Govindasamy said, “For the last four years, Daintee has been an important brand under the SCL umbrella, alongside our esteemed array of tea brands. As we embark on the next 40 years, our mission is clear: To innovate, collaborate, and redefine excellence in the confectionery industry. As a team, we will chart new territories, embracing change and setting new benchmarks for quality and taste.”

“Our commitment to investing in cutting-edge machinery, refining processes, and empowering our employees through training underscores our dedication to ensuring Daintee’s enduring success. With a focus on differentiation, innovation, and relentless competition, we are poised to elevate Daintee into a powerhouse brand, delighting Sri Lankans for generations to come,” Govindasamy stated further.

The 40th-anniversary celebrations were further enriched by the remarkable talents showcased by the Daintee staff. From singing to dance and drama performances, the event came alive with the vibrant energy and creativity of Daintee’s employees.
