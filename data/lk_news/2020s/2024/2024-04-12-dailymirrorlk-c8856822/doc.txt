NTC has failed to assign buses for people to leave Colombo: Anjana

Colombo, April 12 (Daily Mirror) - The Inter-Provincial Private Bus Association (IPPBA) today claimed that the National Transport Commission (NTC) has failed to provide sufficient buses for people to leave from Colombo.

The Association's Secretary Anjana Priyanjith claimed that people have to wait at the private bus stand for more than three hours to get their buses.

During previous years the NTC had discussions with private bus associations to arrange buses without inconveniencing commuters, he said.

"Earlier, we were advised to assign short-distance buses to long-distance services to meet the demand. But this time no such decision has been taken. Therefore, people have to wait many hours at the bus stand to get their transport facilities", Priyanjith said.

Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) said that sufficient buses were assigned for people to get to their villages.

The Railways Department also said that additional trains were assigned for people to leave for their villages. The Department also said they have made new arrangements to assign additional trains according to the requirements.
