Sri Lanka to establish ‘Children of Gaza Fund’ to aid victims of violence

The Cabinet of Ministers has approved a proposal seeking to create a ‘Children of Gaza Fund’ in aid of the victims of violence in the besieged Palestinian enclave.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe has tabled the proposal at the Cabinet meeting held on Monday (Feb.26), according to a statement from the President’s Media Division (PMD).

As such, President Wickremesinghe and Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena have instructed all ministries and state institutions to forego the Iftar celebrations and contribute to this fund.

Contributions from the members of the public are encouraged for this endeavour, the PMD said.

The Sri Lankan government’s donation of USD 1 million will be distributed through official UN agencies to support the health needs of war-affected children in the Gaza Strip.

The Presidential Secretariat has appealed to the citizens to make donations for the ‘Children of Gaza Fund’ during the month of Ramadan to the account number 7040016 at Bank of Ceylon (7010), Taprobane Branch (747) by April 11 and to forward the deposit receipt to 077-9730396 via WhatsApp.
