Police bust suspect selling organ to buy drugs

Jan -26 (Daily Mirror) - In a grim tale of addiction and desperation, Kattankudi Police nabbed two suspects yesterday, uncovering a significant stash of the illegal drug ICE and a shocking story of organ traf­ficking fuelled by addiction.

The raid, led by OIC G.gajanayake, netted a 32-year-old man caught with nearly 3 grams of ICE.

During interrogation, the suspect revealed a chilling truth: he had allegedly sold one of his own kidneys to fund his drug habit.

Adding another layer to this disturbing bust, police apprehended another individual at the scene, found in possession of over 2.4 litres of ICE - a substantial quantity indicative of potential large-scale distribution.

Both suspects were produced before Batticaloa Magistrate M.H.M. Hamza and remanded until February 6th.
