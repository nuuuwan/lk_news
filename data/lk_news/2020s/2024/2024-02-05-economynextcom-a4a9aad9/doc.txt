Sri Lanka should switch to daylight saving time to save energy: SOE revamp unit

ECONOMYNEXT – Switching to daylight saving time would reduce the country’s electricity load demand, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit (SOERU) has said.

“For the electricity sector, an immediate move to daylight saving time could reduce night peak load demand by as much as a third with consequent reduction in thermal energy generation,” SOERU said on social media platform X.

The restructuring unit, established under the Ministry of Finance, in its report ‘SOEs in Sri Lanka: Governance and Consolidation Plan‘, said that “The most serious fiscal problems originate in relation to the energy utilities. Therefore, reforms in this sector are urgent.

“While detailed studies for longer term reform must be undertaken as an interim measure, re-introducing the pricing formula for fuel and extending the formula to electricity will prevent large imbalances building up.”

It recommended “Options to extend hydropower generation though pumped storage solutions, improvements in turbine efficiency and minimising distribution losses could be explored.”

SOERU pointed out that foreign direct investment in the energy sector has been continuously declining in the past decade, from USD 44.9 million in 2013 to USD 1.1 million in 2017.

“This is majorly due to the policy uncertainty and the domestic lending sources are incapable of delivering the liquidity requirement of the energy sector.” (Colombo/Feb5/2024)
