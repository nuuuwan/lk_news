President orders establishment of ‘Ashraf Memorial Museum’ in Kalmunai

President Ranil Wickremesinghe has directed the prompt commencement of construction of the “Ashraf Memorial Museum” in Kalmunai, honoring the late M.H.M. Ashraf, founder of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) and former Minister.

A distinguished politician known for his dedicated service to the Muslim community, the late M.H.M. Ashraf is to be memorialized through this museum.

In recognition of his contributions, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has directed the establishment of an “Ashraf Memorial Museum.”

This initiative follows the request made by Mr. H.M.M. Haris, Digamadulla District Member of Parliament, and the local Muslim community, coinciding with the 24th anniversary of Mr. Ashraf’s death.

The President has allocated Rs. 25 million for the project and has instructed officials to begin construction immediately, the President’s Media Division said.

Mr. Ashraf, remembered as an eloquent lawyer and legislator, played a significant role in serving the Muslim population of the Eastern Province. He was widely respected across various ethnic communities, including Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim groups in the country.
