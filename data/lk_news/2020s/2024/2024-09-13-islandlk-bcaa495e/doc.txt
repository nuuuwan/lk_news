Sri Lanka’s Central Asia gambit

This is the second of a two-part article that was published in The Diplomat.

Today, in terms of bilateral trade, Sri Lanka enjoys modest relations with the region. Between 2011 and 2020, exports to Central Asia exceeded USD 10 million in just one year and with just one country: 2014, with Uzbekistan. On the other hand, in 2015, Sri Lanka imported USD 21 million worth of goods from there.

This underlies a basic feature of the island’s economy: even after 75 years of independence, Sri Lanka imports large-scale manufactures but has only been able to export commodities such as tea, paper products, and coconut oil. As Shiran Illanperuma, an economic analyst, points out, Central Asia’s bilateral relations have been strongest with countries like China, Russia, and India, which have industrialised or are industrialising at a rapid pace. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, “is still using traditional avenues like tea.”

It is also unclear what Central Asia can bring to Sri Lanka. Ravinatha Aryasinha, Executive Director of the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute, noted at the Forum that Sri Lanka should have reached out more to the region after the end of the 30-year war in 2009. Aryasinha served as Sri Lanka’s Foreign Secretary back then, when the country was controversially engaged in a diplomatic battle at the UN Human Rights Council over allegations of human rights abuses and war crimes in the last stages of the conflict.

On the other hand, P. K. Balachandran, an Indian foreign policy analyst based in Colombo, contends that Sri Lanka needs to stabilise its relations with neighbouring South Asian countries, particularly Delhi, before it can think of Central Asia. Rathindra Kuruwita, a Sri Lankan foreign policy commentator and a regular contributor to The Diplomat, largely agrees. “India is engaging more constructively with the region. Whether Sri Lanka can match Delhi’s clout and influence is a big question and at best highly debatable.”

That raises the question of what avenues the island can try in bolstering relations with the region. Bilateral trade and diplomatic relations are obviously paramount, but these will need to be supplemented by other strategies. Cultural cooperation is one possible method – Sri Lanka and Central Asia enjoy historical and cultural ties going back to the third century BC – but all too often, as pointed out at the August 21 conclave, such ties tend to be parroted out like a mantra. These now need to be updated.

One potential way would be sport. For instance, Central Asia and Sri Lanka share a platform for volleyball, Sri Lanka’s national sport. In February 2022, before protests erupted, the country hosted the Central Asian Volleyball Association (CAVA). While cultural engagement is hardly a substitute for economic ties, volleyball and other non-elite sports like elle – Sri Lanka’s equivalent of baseball – garner a lot of interest and galvanise the youth. They have proved less expensive, at a grassroots level, than cricket, the nation’s most popular sport. According to Pasindu Nimsara Thennakoon, a school volleyball player from Ratnapura (a village in the country’s Sabaragamuwa Province) now studying for his A Levels, these sports provide easy, cost-effective ways of reaching out to other regions.

Then there is the issue of how Sri Lanka can get closer to the region. The most obvious way would be through Central Asia’s outreach in South Asia in general and India in particular. Multilateral platforms like the SCO represent another way. Yet the SCO is dominated by a troika – China, Russia, India – while Sri Lanka’s ties with India, which entered a new phase after the 2022 crisis, has been rife with many controversies. Central Asia is pondering energy connectivity with Delhi. But given the blowback against such forms of cooperation, as the lawsuit against Adani Group’s wind power plant project in the country shows, the Sri Lankan government may not be too keen on pursuing this line.

Direct connectivity seems to be the preferred option. As a result of last year’s consultations, for instance, Air Astana began direct charter flights to Colombo. This came about seven months after Türkiye launched direct flights as well. Such developments suggest that the Sri Lankan government and the Foreign Ministry are sincere and keen on extending outward while prioritising relations with major powers. Yet is sincerity alone enough in ensuring that these efforts are carried forward?

As always, the verdict is out there. There is no denying that Sri Lanka faced major issues and sticking points in its foreign policy between 2020 and 2022. That is not to say there were no problems before. But it was during this period that these issues were thrown into sharp relief. More than anything, there was a sense of policy incoherence, an inability to define the country’s foreign policy and a breathtaking ability to anger multiple partners at the same time. Coming out of a crisis, Sri Lanka has only begun to admit to these failures. Central Asia clearly has become a crucial part of the damage-control.

It should be noted, however, that such efforts predate the crisis as well. In 2020, the Sri Lankan government drew up a paper on Africa. Ravinatha Aryasinha, who served as Foreign Secretary then, observes that this was part of a strategy to diversify Sri Lanka’s external relations. However, Aryasinha was replaced soon afterwards, and moved as Ambassador to Washington, from where he retired in 2021. The government did hold consultations with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan that year. But these were never fully followed up.

Certainly, whether or not these strategies bear fruit, the crisis has spurred Sri Lanka to keep its options as open as possible. As it reaches out to new regions and new countries, it will have to prioritise economic recovery. As Sashikala Premawardhane observed at the Central Asia Forum, moreover, the private sector will need to play a major role. She went on to add that a Sri Lankan conglomerate is already operating in the region.

Sri Lanka’s Central Asia gambit may or may not work. Without necessarily parading it as a turnaround in the country’s foreign policy, it must be said that it provides a broader insight into what vulnerable states seeped in crisis are doing to navigate themselves amidst a sea of geopolitical complexities. It is clear that Sri Lanka will need to be innovative and responsive. The question, however, is whether the country can continue these engagements, or whether they will peter out – as they have, all too often, in the past.

He studied at the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies (BCIS), from where he graduated in 2023. His thesis, supervised by Dr Chulanee Attanayake, was on Sri Lanka Central Asia relations. It won the Prize for the Best Dissertation that year.
