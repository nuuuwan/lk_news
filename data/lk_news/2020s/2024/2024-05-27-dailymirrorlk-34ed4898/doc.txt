Western, Sabaragamuwa Provinces, Nuwara-Eliya district affected by heavy showers

Colombo, May 27 (Daily Mirror) - The Western and Sabaragamuwa Provinces and the Nuwara-Eliya district were affected by heavy showers above 100 mm during the day, the Natural Hazards Early Warning Centre of the Meteorology Department said.

This is according to the advisory report on heavy rain issued for the Gampaha, Kegalle, Nuwara Eliya, Colombo, Kalutara and Ratnapura districts.

However, the Department said that prevailing rainy and windy conditions are expected to continue further due to the south-west monsoon that has established over the island.

Fairly heavy showers of about 75 mm are likely at some places in the North-Western and Southern Provinces and in the Kandy district.
