Thilanga Sumathipala has no ethical or legal right to represent UPFA

Colombo, June 6 (Daily Mirror) - Thilanga Sumathipala has no ethical right to pretend to be the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) illegally, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Senior Vice President Mahinda Amaraweera said.

Addressing the media, he said Sumathipala is not the UPFA General Secretary.

"He has not been legally given such a position. I have filed a case before court regarding that appointment. The court has issued an injunction to prevent him or me from using that position until the case is over. Also, the Election Commission has sent a letter in this regard," he said.

"Thilanga Sumathipala is making a mistake by claiming to be the UPFA General Secretary. It is contempt of court. So I am taking legal action in this regard.

"Neither he nor I have permission to do so. Also, after the court decision and the letter given by the Election Commission, I have never expressed my views as the UPFA General Secretary. But I have a legal appointment as the UPFA Secretary General. All these are problems created by the former SLFP President," Minister Amaraweera said.

"None of the parties and organizations that were with the UPFA are now with them. All those people are now with us in the SLFP. Therefore, they only have the board to show as the UPFA. Also, this group is trying to combine the UPFA with the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB). They have been trying for that ever since. But we will not give it a chance.

"They can go personally and join the SJB or any other party. There is no obstacles between us," Amaraweera said.
