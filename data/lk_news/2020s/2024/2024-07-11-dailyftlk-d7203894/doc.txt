Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report published online, to be tabled in Parliament

The Cabinet of Ministers on Tuesday approved presenting the Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report to Parliament for approval.

The Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies has published the Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report on its website, in compliance with Section 10 of the Public Finance Management Act No. 3 of 2003.

This report, which must be tabled in Parliament by the Finance Minister, provides a comprehensive overview of the fiscal position of the State as of mid-year.

The report’s publication fulfils the legal requirement to release this information for public access by the last day of June 2024.

The Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report is a critical document that outlines the Government’s financial performance, including revenue collection, expenditure and overall fiscal health. It serves as an essential tool for transparency and accountability, allowing the public and lawmakers to assess the Government’s economic strategies and fiscal management.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s proposal, in his capacity as the Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies Minister was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

“We encourage all interested parties, particularly the Opposition to review the document on its official website for detailed information,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

“Hopefully, the report will provide valuable insights into the current State of the economy, helping to create a fruitful debate about the policy decisions aimed at economic stabilisation and growth,” he added.
