University non-academic staff to reach decision on future trade union actions

A final decision regarding the future trade union actions of the university non-academic staff will be taken following a discussion with the representatives of all the trade unions, the Inter-University Trade Union Federation said.

The non-academic staff members of state universities engaged in a one-day token strike yesterday (Jan.18) in protest of the government’s decision to increase only the allowances for lecturers.

Earlier this month, the Cabinet of Ministers green-lighted President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s resolution seeking to increase the study allowance granted to university lecturers by 25%. It was decided that this allowance would be included in their January salary.

However, the university trade unions took issue with this Cabinet decision, complaining that increasing the salaries of lecturers has left the non-academic staff members upset.

When inquired by Ada Derana, the co-secretary of the Inter-University Trade Union Federation K.L.D.G. Richmond said they would provide services as usual from today (19) and that a final decision regarding their future trade union actions would be arrived at over the weekend.
