GI Pipes case: Court rejects Keheliya’s objections

Colombo, March 12 (Daily Mirror) - The Colombo High Court today rejected the preliminary objections raised by former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella against the GI pipes case.

Accordingly, Colombo High Court Judge Nawaratne Marasinghe decided to fix the matter for trial and the case will be called again on April 4.

The Bribery Commission had filed indictments before Colombo High Court against former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and two others for allegedly causing unlawful loss to the government after purchasing GI pipes using Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation’s (SLRC) funds during the 2015 Presidential Election while Keheliya Rambukwella was serving as the Minister of Mass Media.

The former Health Minister had raised preliminary objections challenging the maintainability of the case.

The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed indictments against Minister Rambukwella, former SLRC Director General Chandrapala Liyanage and former SLRC Chairman Wimal Rubasinghe under Section 70 of the Bribery Act.

The Bribery Commission alleged that three accused in the case had incurred a loss of Rs.990,000 to the SLRC after unnecessarily purchasing 600 lengths of GI pipes on or around December 2, 2014.
