Sheraton Colombo Hotel welcomes guests to a new era of hospitality

The stunning new Sheraton Colombo Hotel, part of Marriott Bonvoy’s portfolio of over 30 extraordinary brands opened its doors recently. Strategically situated in the central hub of Colombo’s business and shopping district, the new 320-room hotel boasts the brand’s signature warm hospitality amidst a beautifully designed property. With over two decades as an experienced hospitality professional with a passion for operational excellence and guest engagement, Sheraton Colombo Hotel General Manager Rahul Maini shares insights into the hotel’s signature experiences and commitment to providing superior hospitality.

Q: What inspired Colombo as the location of the new Sheraton Hotel, and how does it contribute to the overall guest experience?

Marriott International as a brand is growing globally, increasing its presence across various countries and continents. The company has also been expanding its footprint specifically within Sri Lanka, having witnessed strong growth and positive response for existing hotels in the country. For instance, Weligama Bay Marriott Resort & Spa was the first property launched here, followed by Sheraton Kosgoda Resort & Spa, Courtyard by Marriott Colombo, and now the new Sheraton Colombo Hotel – representing Marriott’s fourth hotel in total and second Sheraton-branded property.

The rationale behind opening an additional Sheraton hotel in Colombo is timing, as we believe current conditions make it an optimal opportunity to cater to rising tourists and business travellers by providing world-class accommodation and meetings infrastructure. Sri Lanka has been recording month-on-month increases in tourist arrivals since 2023, a momentum expected to continue in 2024. Moreover, the government’s tourism promotion initiatives across source markets such as India, China and Europe will further boost demand. Marriott International has been steadily increasing its competitive presence and offerings in Sri Lanka during this period via compelling brands including Sheraton that exemplify world-class service.

Q: Can you elaborate on the world-renowned Sheraton experience and any signature services that guests can look forward to at Sheraton Colombo Hotel?

The Sheraton experience draws inspiration from the public square and is built upon the brand’s passion point, which centres around Sheraton’s design and guest experience strategies. These elements are seamlessly integrated to create an environment that works in harmony, strengthening the brand’s vision of being the world’s gathering place.

When we speak about Sheraton, it is about a place that welcomes the world. There are numerous features to explore, one of which is the Community Table. This table is designed with the idea of making Sheraton a world’s gathering place, where people come together to celebrate special occasions, build connections, and engage in meaningful interactions.

In addition to the Community Table, we have a range of activities that we are planning to include in our services. These activities aim to enhance the overall guest experience. For instance, we will have special community days where locally inspired artists will be invited to showcase their talents, welcoming both hotel guests and neighbours from the community to enjoy these unique experiences.

We aim to provide a distinctive array of local experiences to our guests, going beyond our dining area catering to a wide range of regional, Asian and international cuisines. A special section dedicated to showcasing the rich and diverse flavours of Sri Lankan cuisine, will enable guests to immerse themselves in local culinary delights.

Q: How does the hotel cater to the needs of business travellers, and what facilities are available for corporate events or conferences?

Our Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program is today regarded as the world’s largest travel program. Our services are also designed to cater to the needs of our corporate clientele.

A noteworthy offering for our busy corporate guests is the recently launched Mobile Key. Designed for individuals engrossed in meetings and seeking minimal time at the reception desk, the service supports mobile check-ins. Rooms are pre-blocked and pre-booked based on the arrival date, enabling guests to use their mobile devices to directly access their rooms, bypassing the traditional reception counter.

For our Marriott Bonvoy members, the Sheraton Club Lounge on the 21st floor provides an exclusive space ideal for meetings with clients or business partners. The secluded environment offers special boardrooms and kiosks, ensuring a private setting.
