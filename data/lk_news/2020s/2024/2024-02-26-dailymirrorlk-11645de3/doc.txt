Opposition decides to bring in no faith motion against Speaker

Colombo, Feb 26 (Daily Mirror) -Â  Opposition parties have decided to bring in a no confidence motion against Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena a short while ago.

SJB MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha who confirmed the move at a media briefing said the Opposition parties decided to bring in the no faith motion as the Speaker had violated Parliamentary procedures by neglecting instructions given by the Judiciary with regard to the Online Safety Bill.

"The no faith motion will be handed over within the coming days," Bandara said.

The decision on the no faith motion was made during a meeting of the Opposition parties today.
