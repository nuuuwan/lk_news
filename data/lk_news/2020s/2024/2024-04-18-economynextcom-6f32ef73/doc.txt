Travel industry sources said they had not been consulted on the VFS Global linked cost increases and had taken up the issue with authorities and were awaiting a reply.

Low fees for SAARC citizens have a been Sri Lanka foreign policy strategy of regional integration.

In the ASEAN region, citizens of member countries can travel without any visa and all airports in the region have dedicated immigration counters for them.

Visas for other Asian nationals including those in ASEAN have gone up to from 50 to 75 dollars. With the VFS Global Levy the fee will go up to 93.5 dollars, of up 87 percent.

Meanwhile Sri Lanka’s Daily FT newspaper reported that another 7.27 dollar, ‘convenience fee’ not originally disclosed on the website was charged on top of the 18.5 dollar fee.

So called ‘hidden fees’ are problem in online transactions, according to observers.

If the hidden fee was not charged earlier, SAARC visas would be up 203 percent and ASEAN and other would be up 100 percent.

Earlier an extra fee was charged for on-arrival visas issued physically at the airport, encouraging pre-arrival ETAs which helps speed up passenger processing at the airport.

The VFS Global levy and the visa fee hike comes as President Ranil Wickremesinghe pursues a strategy of greater integration with the ASEAN region.

ASEAN follows a strategy of drawing citizens into the country and getting them to spend in hotels and entertainment.

Sri Lanka is expecting 2.3 million tourists in 2024. At 18.5 dollars a person, the VFS Global Levy would amount to 12.76 billion rupees over a 12-month period.  (Colombo/Apr18/2024)
