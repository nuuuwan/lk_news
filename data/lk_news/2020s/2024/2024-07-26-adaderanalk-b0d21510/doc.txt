President cannot appoint Acting IGP as post is not vacated - PM

Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena has clarified that the President has no legal provisions at this moment to appoint an Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP).

Delivering a special statement in Parliament, the Prime Minister also emphasized that the position of the IGP is not vacated presently.

He also stated that the court cannot change the approval granted by the Constitutional Council to appoint the current IGP.

“We remind the Speaker and Parliament that the order of the Supreme Court suspending the duties of the IGP should be nullified. We request the Speaker to intervene as soon as possible in this regard,” he said.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued an interim order preventing Deshabandu Tennakoon from performing duties and functioning in the position of the IGP.

The Supreme Court had issued this order after granting leave to proceed with the nine petitions, filed by several parties including Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, challenging Tennakoon’s appointment as the IGP.

The Supreme Court had also ordered the President to name a suitable person for the position of IGP, for the duration of the interim order being enforced against Deshabandu Tennakoon.
