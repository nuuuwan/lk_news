Two COVID-19 deaths reported from Kurunegala Teaching Hospital?

Colombo, April 12 (Daily Mirror) - Recent PCR tests conducted on two female patients who had passed away during treatment at the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital have confirmed to be Covid-19.

According to sources, it is not yet conclusive that the deaths can be directly linked to Covid-19. The deaths had occurred yesterday (11).

However, authorities have mandated quarantine measures for both patients and staff members from the ward where the individuals were receiving treatment.

There have been a couple of deaths last year where the patients had tested positive for Coronavirus following their deaths.
