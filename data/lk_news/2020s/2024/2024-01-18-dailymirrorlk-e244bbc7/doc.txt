50 Wild elephants killed by electrocution in 2023: CEB

Colombo, Jan 18 (Daily Mirror) - It was reported that a total of 50 wild elephants had been killed due to electrocution during the past year by connecting Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) power lines to fences protecting farmlands illegally, CEB Deputy General Manager (Business & Operational Strategy) and media spokesman Eng. K.A. Noel Priyantha said.

While issuing a media release, he said that a total of 474 wild elephants had been killed due to various human activities during the past year.

Therefore, the CEB had already taken legal action against those who illegally use electricity to kill elephants. The CEB requests support from the people to protect the elephant population in the country.

Accordingly, the CEB has issued an emergency number 1987 to make direct complaints about incidents relating to connecting power lines to fences protecting cultivations.
