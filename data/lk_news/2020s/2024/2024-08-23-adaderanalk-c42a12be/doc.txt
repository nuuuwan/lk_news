Inland Revenue Department warns public of ‘fake tax collectors’

The Inland Revenue Department (IRD) has issued a warning to the public regarding a surge in fraudulent activities involving individuals impersonating tax officials.

These scams have been reported in various regions, including Colombo, Panadura, Negombo, Wennappuwa, and Minuwangoda, it said in a statement.

The department emphasized that legitimate Inland Revenue Officers will only visit to advise taxpayers to make payments directly into designated bank accounts at the Bank of Ceylon or People’s Bank under the name of the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue and that they will never collect cash or cheques in person.

“If you encounter anyone claiming to be a tax official and requesting cash or checks, please do not comply and instead, report the incident to the nearest police station immediately,” the IRD said, adding that the public’s cooperation is crucial in apprehending such fraudsters.
