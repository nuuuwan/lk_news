The study is an exploratory exercise based on an extensive literature review and interviews with 41 diverse businesses in all nine provinces of Sri Lanka. The study and dialogue at the event aimed to shed light on best practices and how businesses can leverage on existing know how to grow their business potential in modern markets.

Speaking at the event, . Carmen Moreno emphasized that “We must all play a part in promoting inclusion and equality. Governments and the public sector must adopt and implement the necessary legislation and public policies to combat all forms of discrimination and promote social justice. But also, the private sector has an essential role to play in building social cohesion and inclusion, starting at the workplace.” She further stated ” Improving business performance is an imperative at a time of crisis, and the report presented today shows clearly the linkages between economic growth, inclusiveness and social justice and the opportunities for businesses in Sri Lanka to embrace diversity and contribute to build a more resilient and prosperous society”.
