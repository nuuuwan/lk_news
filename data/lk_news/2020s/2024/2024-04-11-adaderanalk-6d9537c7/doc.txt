CPC assures uninterrupted fuel supply during Avurudu season

The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) says it has taken necessary measures to ensure an uninterrupted supply of fuel from Ceypetco filling stations during the Sinhala and Tamil New Year season.

To this end, steps have been taken to maintain adequate stocks by importing fuel shipments to meet the demand, the CPC said further, adding that the filling station owners were given directives in this regard.

Additionally, in a bid to ease the distributorâ€™s fuel ordering procedures, transactions via cheques have been facilitated until 15 April.

During this period, the Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Ltd. will be dispatching sufficient tankers for fuel distribution activities, the CPC added.
