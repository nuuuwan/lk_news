Death becomes a costly affair for Colombo dwellers

Colombo, Feb 7 (Daily Mirror) - Death had become a costly affair for Colombo city dwellers as the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) has increased the charges for a grave (two square feet) to Rs 180,000.

“One can obtain only a small piece of land which is two feet by two feet and it is only possible to bury an urn with ashes of a dead person.” one former member of the CMC who did not wish to be named told Daily Mirror.

However he said the charges for a grave was to be increased in 2018 but the members of the council defeated this resolution in the council that year.

Daily Mirror learnt that the charges have increased to be in line with the land value increase.

Meanwhile former member of CMC Alfred Sampath said the crematorium charges within Colombo City limits have been increased to Rs 10,000 from Rs 1000 for Colombo city dwellers and Rs 20,000 for outsiders. “I have made a written complaint to President Ranil Wickremesinghe with regard to this matter. I was told that the matter was referred to Western Province Governor Roshan Goonetileke,” he said.

Former member of the CMC Shermila Gonawala also said crematorium and grave charges have been increased tremendously. “People cannot afford the new amounts which the CMC charges,” she said.
