Sri Lanka’s SOE losses reverse trend; likely to post Rs. 456 bln profit in 2023: State FinMin

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s key state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have reversed its 2022 losses and made profits in 2023, State Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe said after the government was forced to remove all the subsidies on energy following an International Monetary Fund deal.

Sri Lanka’s state-owned enterprises in 2022 made big losses as currency depreciation hit dollar loans, posting a loss of 743 billion rupees in 2022. Semasinghe said the same SOEs will report a profit of 456 billion rupees in 2023.

Such losses in the past have led the government to borrow more before an unprecedented economic crisis in 022.

“The Minister stated that the reason for recording this profit was the setting of cost-based prices at institutions such as the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC),” the Finance Ministry said in a statement.

The island nation is in the process of implementing comprehensive reforms in SOEs including selling some key firms and privatizing them and reducing a bloated state sector. However, so far none of these reforms has been implemented.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s government has committed to the IMF of getting rid of losses in the SOEs while ensuring higher transfer payments for vulnerable and poor people.

“Minister Semasinghe points out that the government is working to get the contribution of the private sector in order to make the state enterprise more effective,” the Finance Minister said adding that such move will allow the government to focus more on its basic responsibilities.

“The Minister points out that it will provide an opportunity to confirm the effectiveness of people’s tax money and focus more attention on sectors such as education, health, agriculture and infrastructure.”

Semasinghe said the inefficiency of the public enterprises will be minimized and political interference will also be eliminated by restructuring them.

“The Minister further states that it (restructuring) will motivate the relevant institutions to make decisions based on the market conditions and it will create an opportunity to move the country towards a more competitive and sustainable economy.”
