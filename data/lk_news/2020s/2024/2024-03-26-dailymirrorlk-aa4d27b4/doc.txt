NFCO urges Power Ministry to repay electricity reconnection fees

Colombo, March 26 (Daily Mirror) - The National Front of Civil Organizations (NFCO) today demanded that the Ministry of Power and Energy repay the fees collected as electricity reconnection charges.

NFCO president Priyantha Thilakarathna told the media that Rs. 3,000 is charged from electricity consumers for reconnections at present, but it was not reduced as announced by the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL).

He said that the PUCSL had announced the revised charges for electricity consumers for reconnections, but the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) had not taken any decision to revise the reconnection charges.

Therefore, the members of the NFCO gathered in front of the CEB head office in Colombo today, requesting the authority to reveal the total amount of charges collected through the electricity reconnection process via the Right to Information Act.
