Vietnam delegation on agriculture, fisheries, meets Sri Lanka chamber

ECONOMYNEXT – A roundtable discussion between a delegation from Vietnam’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, and the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, looked for collaboration opportunities in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries.

The delegation led by Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development of Vietnam Le Minh Hoan, comprised Ministry officials and entrepreneurs of Vietnam’s agriculture sector.

‘Sri Lanka is strong in several agricultural sectors, with tea, fruit and vegetables especially, having strong export potential to Vietnam. Similarly, Vietnam’s progressive technology can strengthen the agriculture sector in Sri Lanka,’ Chairman of the Ceylon Chamber Duminda Hulangamuwa said in a statement.

Minister Le Minh Hoan said that “bilateral agricultural trade between Vietnam and Sri Lanka has potential for growth,” and highlighted “the respective strengths of the two countries to complement mutual progress and development.”

Given the similarities in topography and climate between the two countries, partnerships to develop the agriculture sector were particularly relevant, the Ambassador of Vietnam to Sri Lanka Ho Thi Thanh Truc said, inviting delegates from both countries to make use of the opportunity to forge connections.

The event was followed by B2B sessions providing a platform for Sri Lankan companies to interact with their Vietnamese counterparts. It was organized in association with the Sri Lanka – Greater Mekong Business Council and the Embassy of Vietnam in Sri Lanka.

President of the Council S M D Suriyakumara said they would facilitate trade and investment cooperation in the agricultural sectors of Sri Lanka and Vietnam. (Colombo/Feb26/2024)
