Online Safety Bill: Chilling Effect On Free Speech

COLOMBO (News 1st) â€“ The Committee to Protect Journalists joined 58 organizations in calling on Minister for Public Security Tiran Alles to withdraw the proposed Online Safety Bill and conduct sustained multi-stakeholder consultations, including with civil society and human rights experts.

The Bill, set to be tabled in Parliament this month, has drawn sharp criticism for its overly broad definitions of offenses, lack of independent oversight, and potential for abuse by the executive.

Vague terminology: "False statements" and "ill-will" definitions could arbitrarily restrict speech and empower censorship.

Executive control: The Bill grants excessive power to a President-appointed Commission, raising concerns about political manipulation.

Data privacy risks: Demanding user identification and proactive monitoring pose threats to privacy and security.

Digital economy harm: Stifling online expression could damage Sri Lanka's growing digital economy and employment opportunities.

The groups urged the government to withdraw the Bill and engage in meaningful consultations with all stakeholders, including human rights and technology experts, to develop a nuanced approach to online content regulation.

They emphasized the need for safeguards that respect fundamental rights, follow international law, and prioritize user empowerment.
