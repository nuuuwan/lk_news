McDonalds gets court order to stop Sri Lanka franchise: report

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Colombo Commercial High Court has issued an order preventing the island’s McDonalds restaurant franchisee from using the brand, a media report said.

Sri Lanka’s Daily Mirror newspaper said McDonalds Corporation had sought an order preventing Abans Plc from selling McDonald’s food items in Sri Lanka.

There were restaurants in Kotahena, Nugegoda, Kiribathgoda, Battaramulla, Kollupitiya, Rajagiriya, Welisara, Mount Lavinia, Colombo City Centre, Macleod Road restaurant and Shangri-La restaurant.

McDoland’s had entered into a Development Agreement with the local franchise on August 21, 1997.

“The plaintiff further states that the basis of the Development Agreement has ceased to exist due to the actions of the defendant,” the Daily Mirror said.

“The plaintiff further states that the plaintiff does not desire the defendant to be a franchisee and to operate any restaurant under the name McDonald’s.” (Colombo/Mar24/2024)
