Four females arrested after brutal assault on child goes viral

Aranayake Police arrested four women yesterday after a video showing them brutally assaulting a six-year-old boy went viral on social media platforms.

Police said the four women included the boy’s mother, grandmother, aunt and great-aunt.

In the video, two older women are seen beating and dragging a child inside a house. After closing the door, they continue the beatings inside. The child’s cries can be heard aloud as the person recording the video and other neighbours remain outside. The video had been recorded by a neighbour in the area.

According to police spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa, the incident had taken place in Ehelagastenne, Aranayake. The police had arrested the four women within hours of the video being uploaded online, he confirmed.

“The child had been beaten due to an act of disobedience,” he said. “The mother was observed watching the child being assaulted and she was arrested for aiding and abetting the abuse,” he added.

Thalduwa said the child is set to undergo medical checks. The boy is currently receiving treatment at the Mawanella Hospital.

The Spokesperson said the child will undergo medical examinations and urged the public to report any such acts of cruelty against children.

This is the second such incident this year, where a viral video led to the arrest of suspects involved in the abuse of children.
