Sinhala and Tamil New Year dawns today; ‘Punya Kaalaya’ begins

The inauspicious time (Punya Kaalaya or Nonagathaya) of 2024 Sinhala and Tamil New Year commenced a short while ago at 2.41 p.m. and is slated to end at 3.29 a.m. tomorrow (14). Sri Lankans are set to celebrate the dawn of the traditional New Year this year at 9.05 p.m. today (13).

The New Year, known as ‘Aluth Avurudda’ in Sinhala, and ‘Puththandu’ in Tamil, is celebrated by both communities by observing various rituals and customs.

According to traditional astrological belief, the Sun completes its movement across the twelve segments of the Zodiac in the course of a year taking one month to travel each constellation.

The transition of the Sun from the House of Pisces to the House of Aries marks the beginning of the New Year (Aluth Avurudu).

A number of customs and traditional beliefs are associated with Avurudu celebrations in Sri Lanka. The Sinhalese are influenced by astrological faiths and perform several religious practices during this time.

This year, deciding on the best date for the New Year celebrations was marred by a disputation among the 42-member group of astrologers employed by the Cultural Affairs Ministry, with one of them accusing the others of misinterpreting the position of stars.

Despite the majority setting the dawn of the traditional Sinhala and Tamil New Year on the night of April 13, one astrologer claimed that this ‘auspicious’ time was wrong and would lead the country into “disaster.”

Against this backdrop, the Ministry of Buddha Sasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs issued a special statement regarding the matter, urging the public to follow the official list of auspicious times issued by the State Astrologers’ Committee.
