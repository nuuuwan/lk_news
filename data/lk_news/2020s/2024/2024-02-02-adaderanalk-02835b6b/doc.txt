The Sub-Inspector (SI) of Police who was arrested over the alleged ‘accidental’ shooting of a lorry driver in Narammala recently has been further remanded.

Accordingly, the SI was ordered to be remanded until 16 February on orders of the Narammala Magistrate’s Court.

On January 18, a 41-year-old lorry driver was killed after a police officer in civilian attire had ‘accidentally’ discharged his firearm during a vehicle inspection. The victim was identified as a resident of Maharachchimulla area.

The police media division said the driver had failed to comply with a signal to stop at a police checkpoint in Dampelessa, Narammala.

The concerned SI and a Police Constable had then chased down the lorry and pulled.
