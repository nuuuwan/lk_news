National Organizer of the party Namal Rajapaksa has been temporarily appointed as the Anuradhapura district leader, ousting Parliamentarian S. M. Chandrasena from the position.

Meanwhile, Parliamentarian Nipuna Ranawaka has been temporarily appointed as the Matara district leader, replacing Minister Kanchana Wijesekera, while State Minister Mohan Priyadarshana de Silva has been appointed as the Galle district leader, replacing Minister Ramesh Pathirana.

In this context, the Kandy District electoral council of the SLPP convened yesterday (03) under the chairmanship of District Leader Parliamentarian Mahindananda Aluthgamage. During the meeting, a resolution was passed to support the incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Meanwhile, a rally was held in Hanguranketha, Nuwara Eliya, under the chairmanship of S. B. Dissanayake, where a resolution was passed expressing support for President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Additionally, at the Kegalle District Conference of the SLPP, a resolution endorsing President Ranil Wickremesinghe for the upcoming presidential election was unanimously adopted. The conference was attended by Kegalle district ministers, provincial council members, and local government representatives, as per reports.

In the meantime, a group of Ministers from the Ratnapura district of the SLPP met today to discuss whether to support the incumbent President Wickremesinghe. The meeting, chaired by State Minister Janaka Wakkumburu, was attended by Minister Prasanna Ranatunga, State Minister Premalal Jayasekara, Parliamentarian Mudita De Zoysa, and several other members.

Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, the United National Party, and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party in the Gampaha District have initiated efforts to develop a joint program aimed at re-electing President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in the upcoming presidential election.

However, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna has sent a letter to its MPs notifying the decisions made by the political bureau regarding adherence to party discipline. The letter states that any member who opposes the decisions made by the party will have their membership revoked, regardless of their position within the party
