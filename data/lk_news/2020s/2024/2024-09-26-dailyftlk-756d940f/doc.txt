Research Intelligence Unit (RIUNIT), a leading international research and consulting firm, yesterday announced the signing of an exclusivity agreement for a prime plot allocation within Port City Colombo. This marks a pivotal second step in RIUNIT’s ambitious real estate venture, “Asia’s Real Estate Opportunity of the Century.”

The agreement was signed on 24 September by Port City Colombo General Manager of Investment Promotion and Marketing Zheng Tian reinforcing RIUNIT’s ongoing commitment to driving economic growth and innovation in the region. This milestone follows the successful launch event held on 16 July, where RIUNIT unveiled its comprehensive initiative designed to empower local developers and investors to engage with the transformative Port City project.

The signing ceremony underscores RIUNIT’s role as a key player in opening new avenues for Sri Lankan developers and small investors within the Port City development. By securing this plot, RIUNIT strengthens its ability to create accessible entry points for local participation, offering a unique opportunity to invest in one of Asia’s most promising real estate markets.

Speaking on the occasion RIUNIT CEO Roshan Madawela stated: “This agreement represents a critical step towards our vision of involving regional developers in Port City Colombo. Our initiative is geared towards facilitating sustainable investments for Sri Lanka ensuring they can take advantage of the vast potential of this ground-breaking project.”

This agreement builds on the success of RIUNIT’s launch event, which attracted industry leaders, visionaries, and experts to explore the unparalleled opportunities within Port City. The initiative, titled “Asia’s Real Estate Opportunity of the Century,” offers detailed insights into market trends, investment strategies, and regulatory frameworks, making it an essential resource for investors. “The Port City represents a strictly regulated and zoned space that respects the aesthetic needs of humans while also providing all supporting commercial and recreational amenities at close hand. The lifestyle opportunities that will be offered here are unparalleled in Sri Lanka and perhaps the world over,” said RIUNIT Member of Advisory Board Architect Nilesh De Silva.

With this exclusivity agreement now signed, RIUNIT said it is well-positioned to advance its goal of fostering local involvement in Port City’s growth. RIUNIT added that it remains committed to providing in-depth research, analysis, and insights to guide industry professionals and investors as they navigate this evolving landscape.
