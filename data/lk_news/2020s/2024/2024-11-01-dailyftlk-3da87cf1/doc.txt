Charitha accuses Govt. of not having clear plan

Claims President and NPP’s push to acquire Parliamentary power to strengthen the Presidency, undermines the role of Parliament

Argues that Parliament is the primary legislative body representing the people and should not be positioned as an arm of executive power

Says PM’s recent statement dismissing relevance of cabinet decisions taken by previous Government is constitutionally inaccurate

Former MP Prof. Charitha Herath has criticised the current Government for governing without a clear plan. He also raised concerns over the approach advocated by President Anura Dissanayake and the National People’s Power (NPP), suggesting that their push to acquire Parliamentary power to strengthen the Presidency, undermines the role of Parliament as an independent legislative body.

The former MP made these comments while addressing a press conference at the Samagi Jana Sandhanaya (SJS) head office yesterday.

Herath argued that Parliament is the primary legislative body representing the people and should not be positioned as an arm of executive power. “Bringing Parliament as half of the Executive President is politically incorrect,” Herath emphasised, warning that the constitution does not place parties or central committees above Parliament’s authority.

Herath further highlighted instances of what he described as hasty and uncoordinated decisions by the current administration. He noted that the Prime Minister’s recent statement dismissing the relevance of cabinet decisions taken by the previous Government is constitutionally inaccurate. According to Herath, while the new cabinet can amend past decisions, it cannot reject them outright, as cabinet decisions are constitutionally significant within the governing structure.

The former MP also commented on an issue regarding the previous administration’s decision to raise public servants’ salaries, a matter reportedly missing from the Finance Ministry’s records. Herath said that if the current Government opposes the decision, it should formally rescind it through a new cabinet paper, underscoring the importance of transparent governance.

Herath also voiced strong opposition to suggestions that Parliament should function primarily to support the Presidency, stating, “The Presidential election and general election are distinct processes. We urge citizens not to conflate the two by allowing Parliament to act merely as an extension of Presidential authority.” He emphasised the importance of an independent, intelligent Parliament, with members who are capable of open dialogue and critical thinking rather than blind support for the President. Herath also noted a decline in protest actions against the Government, attributing it to the fact that many groups that previously led protests now hold Governmental power. He argued that these groups, after gaining power, have failed to take action against corruption and fraud, with anti-corruption pledges remaining mere rhetoric. As the general election nears, Herath urged citizens to elect a capable, knowledgeable Parliament that can tackle the country’s pressing economic and social issues rather than one focused on reinforcing the Presidency. He commended Sajith Premadasa’s leadership within the SJS, highlighting their political vision and team as key players in moving forward.

Herath questioned whether any single party could realistically secure a two-thirds majority in Parliament and raised the possibility of a coalition Government. He advised voters to select experienced, talented representatives in the general election, cautioning against voting for NPP candidates based on Presidential support alone.
