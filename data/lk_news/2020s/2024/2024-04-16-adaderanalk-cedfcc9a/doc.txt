Expressway generate revenue of Rs. 235 million in six days

The Road Development Authority (RDA) says the expressways have generated an income of Rs. 235 million within the past six days from 10 - 15 April.

According to the RDA’s director general, Eng. Priyantha Suriyabandara, this year’s expressway revenue improved by approximately Rs. 80 million during the Sinhala and Tamil New Year season, in comparison to 2023.

During festive seasons, especially the traditional New Year, the RDA collects a substantial amount of revenue from expressways as traffic volume on the thoroughfare surges with many people visiting their hometowns and going on vacations.
