Vehicle prices set to increase after import resumptions next year: Importers

Colombo, March 15 (Daily Mirror) - Local vehicle importers claimed that the current market prices of vehicles would increase after the proposed resumption of vehicle imports from next year due to the chang in the duty structure.

They said the government had implemented a significant change in the duty structure in January, resulting in a substantial increase in the marginal cost of importing vehicles.

The importers also claimed that vehicles would be imported under huge restrictions.

According to the survey conducted by the association, the existing local market prices of vehicles would increase after the import of new vehicles.

Addressing a gathering organized by the United Youth Union, titled "Future of the Youth," held this week at Taprobane Entertainment, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that he hopes to gradually relax the import of private vehicles starting next year.

The President also said that under the balance of payments, the government has allowed the import of everything other than vehicles.
