USAID gives Sri Lanka disaster management equipment

ECONOMYNEXT – The USA has given vital equipment to Sri Lanka’s Disaster Management Centre (DMC) to strengthen the island’s preparedness for climate-related emergencies, as climate change intensifies.

The donation was made by the United States Agency for International Development’s (USAID) Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA), through the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP).

The consignment is part of a broader 2.5 million dollar (approx 760 million rupees) USAID-funded WFP project and will complement government efforts to improve its disaster risk management capacities and strengthen Sri Lanka’s ability to better prepare for climate shocks.

Equipment including submersible water pumps, kitchen sets, chainsaws, polysack bags and tarpaulins, was handed over by USAID BHA’s Regional Humanitarian Advisor for South and Central Asia Dustin Shiau to Director General of the DMC Major General (Retired) Udaya Herath.

“Helping save lives, protect property, and reduce the impact of disasters on populations is at the core of US humanitarian disaster response efforts in Sri Lanka and worldwide,” US Embassy Chargé d’Affaires Doug Sonnek said.

USAID has been working with Sri Lanka’s disaster management authorities to augment their preparations to prevent and mitigate disasters and their impact on at-risk populations.

“Effective preparedness is critical in saving lives and livelihoods and preventing hazards from turning into disasters,” WFP Sri Lanka’s Representative and Country Director Abdur Rahim Siddiqui said. “As climate

change intensifies, our efforts are channelled towards mitigating its impact to safeguard people and their access to food and nutrition.”

Recent flooding caused by the South-west monsoon affected 20 of the country’s 25 districts. The island has seen a rise in extreme weather conditions. (Colombo/Jul18/2024)
