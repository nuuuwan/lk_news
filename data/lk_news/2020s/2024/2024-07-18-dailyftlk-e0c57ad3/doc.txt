The World Bank Group has retained the services of MTI Consulting to assess the Bahrain Private Sector – through the Bahrain Enterprise Survey 2024, which will finally be used as inputs for the World Bank’s Business Ready

The Enterprise Surveys collect data on firms’ perception of the business environment, including finance, infrastructure, competition, and corruption. This data is used for the World Bank’s B-READY project, a flagship report that benchmarks the business and investment climate worldwide, evaluating the regulatory framework, public services for firms, and their practical efficiency.
