India pledges continuous backing for Sri Lanka’s economic recovery

ECONOMYNEXT – India has pledged continuous support for Sri Lanka’s economic recovery after the island nation reached formal debt restructuring deal with its bilateral creditors.

Sri Lanka also reached the same deal with Export and Import Bank of China separately after Beijing had negotiations with Colombo government outside the Official Creditors Committee (OCC).

“India will continue to support Sri Lanka’s economic recovery including by promoting long-term investments in its key economic sectors,” India’s External Affairs Ministry said in a statement.

India said the milestone signing the deal after several rounds of engagements, “demonstrates the strong progress made by Sri Lanka in stabilizing its economy and moving towards reform and growth”.

India was the first country to assist Sri Lanka with a $1 billion credit line after the island nation declared bankruptcy in April 2022.

India has been in discussion with Sri Lanka for renewable energy projects along with land, fuel, gas, and power grid connectivity projects.

However, Indian projects are facing delays partially due to more than expected negotiation process and legal cases after some environmentalists have filed fundamental rights case over Adani wind power project.

Sources this week said Sri Lanka’s state-run Ceylon Electricity Board has received the lowest bid for 4.88 US cents a kilowatt hour for a 50 MegaWatt wind power plant in Mannar from Windforce Plc compared to 8.26 US cents, a move which is likely to intensify protest against Adani deal.
