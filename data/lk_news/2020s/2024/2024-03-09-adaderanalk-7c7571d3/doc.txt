Possible train delays on coastal line over next two days

Train operations on a section of the Coastal Line, stretching between Colombo Fort and Wellawatte railway stations, have been restricted due to essential maintenance activities, Sri Lanka Railways said.

Accordingly, train operations will remain limited to a single track of the railway line on 09,10 and 11 March 2024, as communicated by the Department of Railways.

The department explained that this action was taken as a result of essential maintenance of a bridge located between the Kollupitiya and Kompanna Veediya railway stations and a pipeline laying work by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board.

Thus, there will be possible train delays on the coastal line owing to this situation, the Department of Railways added.
