Iran foreign minister in Sri Lanka to discuss expanded cooperation

ECONOMYNEXT – Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Hossein Amir Abdollahian is in the island on an official visit to Sri Lanka.

“Consultation to expand cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, agriculture, science and technology, technical and engineering services, etc is on our common agenda,” the minister said on X (twitter).

The Iranian minister’s visit on an invitation, follows a visit by Israeli Minister of Transport and Road Safety, Brig Gen Miri Regev last week.

State Minster of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya welcomed the Iranian Minister. “Sri Lanka is honoured to host His Excellency, and I hope his time in #SL will contribute to deepening ties of #diplomacy and partnership between our countries,” Balasuriya said on X (twitter).

Analysts say the diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and Iran have been intact despite a sanction by the United States which deprived Sri Lanka from receiving cheap Iranian light crude since 2012.

Colombo has been in the process of repaying a $251 million due for crude imports before the sanctions via tea exports to Tehran. Sri Lanka inked a deal in December 2021 to set off export of tea to Iran against the legacy oil credit owed by state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corporation to the National Iranian Oil Company, without busting US sanctions.

Iranian leader Dr Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi has accepted an invitation by his Sri Lankan counterpart Ranil Wickremesinghe to visit the South Asian island nation in the near future, after the two met on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York in September.
