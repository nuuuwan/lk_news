Daily consumption of eggs has increased by one million

Colombo, May 31 (Daily Mirror) - The daily consumption of eggs in the country has increased by one million compared to the last few months, the Animal Production and Health Department (DAPH) reported.

The rise in foreign tourists and the increase in meat, fish and egg prices, which are highly nutritious and affordable foods, were cited as the reasons for the boost in consumption.

Officials of the DAPH said the above points were discussed at a meeting with Agriculture and Plantation Industries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.

However, the Minister instructed the Agriculture Ministry Livestock Division to conduct a survey on the consumption of eggs, milk and meat since a proper information survey has not been done for a long time.
