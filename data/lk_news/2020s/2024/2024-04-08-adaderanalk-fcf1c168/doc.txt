Ex-Health Minister Keheliya and 07 others further remanded

Former Minister of Health Keheliya Rambukwella and 07 others who were implicated in the alleged import of substandard immunoglobulin vials have been further remanded until April 22 by the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court, Ada Derana reporter said.

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Rambukwella on 02 February in connection with the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), when he arrived there, complying with a court order. He had been grilled for nearly 10 hours before being arrested.

The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker.

Prior to the apprehension of Rambukwella, seven arrests had been made in connection with the drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail. As such, the former Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministry’s Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, now remain in remand custody.

Meanwhile a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition was filed Thursday (29 Feb.) on behalf of former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella.

Rambukwella’s attorneys have filed the relevant petition challenging his arrest by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), and demanding a compensation of Rs. 100 million.

The individuals who currently remain under remand custody over the alleged drug scandal include former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, former Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Chandragupta, Additional Secretary of the Health Ministry Dr. Saman Ratnayake, the Director of the Health Ministry’s Medical Supplies Division and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the relevant company which is said to have imported the batch of substandard Immunoglobulin vials by forging documents.
