Strict security measures in place for May Day rallies

Colombo, May 1 (Daily Mirror) - Police have deployed nearly 10,000 officers including Special Task Force (STF) personnel and intelligence officers across the country for security and traffic management during today's May Day rallies and parades.

Police Spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa said that tri-forces personnel are also on standby at police stations if needed. May Day rallies are planned in 35 police areas across the country with at least 14 scheduled in Colombo alone.

"Nearly 5,000 police officers are deployed solely for security and traffic management in Colombo," DIG Thalduwa said.

With a focus on enhancing security measures, the spokesman said only permitted drone cameras will be allowed for use during the rallies.

Police urged rally attendees to refrain from littering roads with plastics and waste.

DIG Thalduwa said strict action will be taken against individuals engaging in unruly behavior under the influence of alcohol, causing inconvenience to the public and traffic.

"Motorists are advised to remain vigilant due to the large number of political party supporters attending the rallies and parades, which may impact road conditions," he said.

Meanwhile, he said that legal action will be taken against bus drivers transporting supporters to the rallies if found under the influence of alcohol.

If anyone traveling to the hospital in their own vehicles due to an emergency is stranded on the road due to rally activities, they are urged to inform nearby officers on duty. The spokesman said that the officers will provide assistance to ensure they reach the hospital promptly.
