Govt. eyes import of eggs again?

The Ministry of Trade states that the government is once again focusing on the import of eggs.

When inquired by Ada Derana, a spokesperson of the ministry said that this decision comes in response to local egg producers maintaining consistently high prices.

Furthermore, the spokesman highlighted that local producers are deliberately limiting the number of eggs released to the market to keep prices elevated. Additionally, he mentioned that these producers have resorted to selling animals for meat to control egg production further and maintain high prices.

However, it is reported that a discussion pertaining to the matter is scheduled to be held tomorrow (22), where further measures will be considered to address the ongoing issue.
