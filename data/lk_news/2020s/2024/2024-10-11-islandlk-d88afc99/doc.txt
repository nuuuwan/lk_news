Justice Thurairaja makes impassioned plea on behalf of SL’s plantation community

‘Unveiling the hidden struggles of Sri Lanka’s plantation workers: A Call for Action’, in other words improving living conditions, providing fair wages, enhancing access to social services and ensuring that the rights of plantation workers are respected and protected under the law. This is the belief of Justice S. Thurairaja; judge of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka.

Justice Thurairaja made an impassioned speech last week at a Caritas Sri Lanka event in Colombo, during the launch of two significant research reports: ‘Right for Education: For the Children of the Plantation Community in Sri Lanka – Issues, Challenges and Future Directions’ and ‘Culture and Identity of the Plantation Communities in Sri Lanka’. His heartfelt words resonated deeply with those present as he highlighted the hidden struggles of the plantation community.

Justice Thurairaja is the first person of Indian origin in Sri Lanka to become a Court of Appeal judge and a Supreme Court judge.

Opting to speak without a prepared script, Justice Thurairaja, who hails from the upcountry, reflected on the profound social and economic inequalities faced by the plantation workers.

He drew a poignant contrast between the smiling faces of young girls dancing at the event and the harsh reality of women labouring in the tea estates without a fraction of that joy. “I wish the ladies and girls who are plucking tea leaves also had that millionth of a smile, he remarked, emphasizing the emotional and physical toll that plantation labor takes on these workers.

In a symbolic anecdote, Thurairaja pointed to a tree planted as a sample, now standing tall at 90 feet, and used it as a metaphor for the backbreaking work performed by the plantation workers under its shade. “We see the green on top, but we don’t see the blood underneath, he stated, bringing attention to the unseen sacrifices of those whose efforts fuel Sri Lanka’s globally renowned tea industry.

The justice also touched on the complexities of identity faced by Sri Lanka’s plantation communities, often referred to as “Indian Tamils.” He reflected on his experiences in Fiji and Malaysia, observing how Indian-origin populations in those countries had largely lost their cultural identities. In contrast, he praised the plantation community in Sri Lanka for maintaining its cultural roots despite significant challenges. However, he noted that identity issues remain, particularly due to the erroneous classification of Indian-origin Tamils as Sri Lankan Tamils during census registration, leading to the gradual erosion of their unique heritage.

Thurairaja also critiqued the economic model that continues to marginalize plantation workers. “Ceylon tea is marketed worldwide, bringing significant foreign exchange into the country, but are these workers compensated? Isn’t it blood money? he asked, referring to the dire conditions under which tea is produced.

He also shared a harrowing personal account of a mother who sold her kidney to ensure her child’s education, emphasizing the extreme sacrifices made by plantation workers in pursuit of better opportunities for their children.
