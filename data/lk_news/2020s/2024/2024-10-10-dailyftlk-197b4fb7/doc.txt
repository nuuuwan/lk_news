Dilith criticises Sajith for weak Opposition leadership

Sarvajana Balaya Alliance leader Dilith Jayaweera criticised Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa for failing to effectively challenge the Government and offer robust leadership. At a press conference held yesterday, Jayaweera argued that Premadasa was “forced to remain in Opposition” because he has not fulfilled the responsibilities of the position with sufficient bravery and vision.

According to Jayaweera, a true Opposition must not only criticise the Government but also guide it toward the correct path, offering constructive solutions while laying the groundwork for future political progress. “A brave Opposition must remain in Opposition but show the Government the correct path and provide guidance,” Jayaweera stated. “The Opposition should create the necessary circumstances for the future of politics to promote our political beliefs, our program, and our vision to realise the aspirations of the people.”

Jayaweera emphasised that the Sarvajana Balaya Alliance’s objective is not to remain permanently in Opposition but to influence the course of Sri Lankan politics toward their goals. “Our intention is not to remain in Opposition politics as Sajith has,” Jayaweera said,
