Mujibur Rahmanâ€™s name gazetted as SJB MP

A Gazette notification has been issued stating that Mujibur Rahman has been nominated by the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) to fill the vacancy in Parliament created by the disqualification of Diana Gamage as Member of Parliament by a Supreme Court verdict.

Accordingly, the Election Commission, acting under section 64(5) of the Parliamentary Elections Act, No. 1 of 1981 read with provisions of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, has announced that Mohamad Mujibur Rahman was declared elected as a Member of Parliament to fill the vacancy created due to the determination of the Supreme Court cancelling the parliamentary membership of Diana Gamage aforesaid.

The Secretary-General of Parliament informed the Election Commission that a Parliamentary seat in the Ninth Parliament has become vacant from 08 May 2024, due to the cancellation of parliamentary seat of Member of Parliament Diana Gamage.

In a press release, the Communication Department of Parliament said this was formally conveyed to the Chairman of the Election Commission in writing, pursuant to Section 64(1) of Parliamentary Elections Act No.01 of 1981.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday (May 08) declared that State Minister Diana Gamage is not legally qualified to hold a parliamentary seat.

Accordingly, delivering its verdict, the three-judge Supreme Court bench decided that Gamage is not eligible to hold the position of Member of Parliament as she holds dual citizenship.
