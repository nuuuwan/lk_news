Sri Lanka starts issuance of train tickets online

For the first time in Sri Lanka, the government has introduced an online platform (www.pravesha.lk) for railway passengers to purchase tickets.

This new system now allows passengers traveling even short distances to buy train tickets using their mobile phones.

Speaking about the initiative, the Ssecretary of the Ministry of Transport and Highways, Eng. Ranjith Rubasinghe, stated the issuance of train tickets online has been effective since yesterday (22).

“Passengers can now purchase digital train tickets through the website www.pravesha.lk eliminating the need to wait in queue. Tickets will still be available at counters for those who prefer to purchase them in person.”

“We plan to introduce this online system for season tickets before the end of this year. Additionally, new methods for train seat reservations and goods transportation will be rolled out over the next three months,” he said.
