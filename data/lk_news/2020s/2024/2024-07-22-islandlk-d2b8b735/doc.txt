Of that boomerang

The Rajapaksa-Wickremesinghe government has painted itself into a corner well and truly by trying to delay the upcoming presidential election. Two fundamental rights cases challenging the validity of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution and the legality of the reduction of the presidential/parliamentary term from six years to five years were laughed out of court. Now, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has undertaken to amend Article 83 b of the Constitution purportedly to infuse it with clarity in respect of the length of presidential/parliamentary term by replacing ‘six years’ with ‘five years’. He has had the proposed 22nd Amendment published in the Government Gazette for that purpose amidst speculation that it is aimed at creating confusion in the public mind and postponing the next presidential election.

Prof. G. L. Peiris has, in his article published on this page today, clinically examined the 22nd Amendment Bill and warned of dire consequences. One cannot but agree with him that such political moves are a danger to democracy. His cogent arguments and prescient warning should be heeded if trouble is to be averted.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s attempt to have the public believe that the 22nd Amendment Bill is intended to rectify a mistake made by Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne, PC, during the Yahapalana government has boomeranged on him. Speaking at a recent public event, Wickremesinghe sought to ridicule Dr. Wickramaratne, who has rightly condemned the proposed 22nd Amendment; he claimed that in 2015, for want of a better alternative, he had assigned Dr. Wickramaratne to draft the 19th Amendment to reduce the length of the presidential/parliamentary term, among other things, but the latter had botched the task by leaving Article 83 unchanged. He apologised to the public for the ‘mistake’, which, he said, he had undertaken to rectify. Dr. Wickramaratne responded that in 2015 Wickremesinghe, as the Prime Minister, himself had presented the 19th Amendment, prepared by a committee, to Parliament, and Article 83 had been left untouched because the Yahapalana  government did not want to move any constitutional amendment that required a referendum for its passage.

The Yahapalana administration was wary of facing a referendum as it did not want to undertake anything that would put its electoral strength to test before the 2015 general election. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had made a comeback sooner than expected, by that time, and the SLFP-led UPFA was recovering lost ground fast so much so that President Maithripala Sirisena had go to the extent of queering the pitch for Mahinda, who was leading the UPFA’s general election campaign, to ensure the UNP-led UNF’s victory in the 2015 parliamentary election. Thus, it may be seen that the Yahapalana government needed a referendum like a hole in the head, and Dr. Wickramaratne has told the truth.

A referendum is a huge gamble that no government is willing to take over a constitutional amendment. Not even the mighty J. R. Jayewardene government, which had a five-sixths parliamentary majority, dared to do so. One may recall that it sought to amend the Constitution to turn Kalawana into a two-member electorate in 1980 to accommodate UNP MP Abeyratne Pilapitiya, who lost an election petition, and the MP to be elected at a by-election the following year. When the Civil Rights movement challenged the third constitutional amendment Bill which the UNP moved to compass its sinister end, the Supreme Court held that its passage required ratification by a two-thirds majority in Parliament and endorsement by the people at a referendum. The Jayewardene government in which Wickremesinghe was a minister, abandoned its plan, and a by-election was held. Sarath Muttetuwegama was elected. Pilapitiya had to resign. Two years later, the Jayewardene government resorted to widespread rigging and political violence to win a referendum which enabled it to make a general election disappear; it thereby created conditions for the JVP’s second uprising that plunged the country into a bloodbath in the late 1980s.

The Rajapaksa-Wickremesinghe government had better learn from the 2022 popular uprising here and the current political upheavals in Bangladesh, and refrain from testing the patience of the public.

What brings about the downfall of a government or a political leader is the arrogance of power more than anything else. What befell President Mahinda Rajapaksa during his second term should serve as a lesson for other leaders. Intoxicated with power, he thought no end of himself, took public opinion for granted, and eventually had to head for the hills with angry mobs in close pursuit.
