Rice distribution not a panacea to people’s struggles - Namal

SLPP MP Namal Rajapaksa says despite difficulties Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s regime did not reach a point where rice distribution became necessary

Notes SL has a good economy especially during his father’s tenure where people could easily purchase rice

Says alongside rice distribution Govt. must focus on developing SL’s fledgling rural economy

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) National Organiser and Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa yesterday stressed that the Government’s distribution of rice to the people of the country is not a solution to the struggles they are facing.

“During the tenure of Mahinda Rajapaksa, we had an economy in which people could easily purchase rice. There was no need to distribute rice to the people,” he noted. He added that such a move was not necessary even during the tenure of his uncle, former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.

“During Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s tenure, power outages were prevalent. If the Uma Oya project had been completed by the previous Government, power cuts would not have been unnecessary. This would have prevented the need to import fuel, thus retaining dollars within the country. Despite the challenges we faced, our Government did not reach a point where distributing rice to the people became necessary,” he said.

The comments come amid a backdrop where the Government has commenced a National Rice Distribution program for low-income families. The initiative was announced by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in March.

Rajapaksa acknowledged the hardships faced by low-income families in villages and recognised the challenges in the country’s rural economy. “Distributing rice is a commendable initiative. However, alongside rice distribution, we must focus on building an economy that supports purchasing rice from rural farmers,” he emphasised. He further said that as a responsible party, the SLPP regularly informs the President and the Government about these concerns.
