Injunction issued preventing SJB from removing Sarath Fonseka from party and posts

A court order has been issued preventing the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) from suspending Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka’s party membership and removing him from positions held within the party.

Accordingly, the relevant injunction, effective for a period of 14 days, prevents the political party from ousting Field Marshal Fonseka from the SJB, taking disciplinary action against him and removing him from posts in the party.

The relevant order was issued by the Colombo District Court on Monday (19 Jan.), upon consideration of a petition filed by Fonseka.

The order was issued by Colombo District Judge Sandun Withana, against party leader Sajith Premadasa, SJB General Secretary Ranjith Maddumabandara, Treasurer Harsha de Silva and National Organiser Tissa Attanayake.

Appearing on behalf of the petitioner, President’s Counsel Faiszer Musthapha informed the court that according to recent media reports, the SJB plans on taking disciplinary action against Fonseka over his comments on former Army Commander Gen. (Retd.) Daya Ratnayake joining the main opposition party.

Thus, Fonseka requested the court for an injunction order preventing the SJB from taking disciplinary action against him, and removing him from the both, the party and his posts within the party.

MP Sarath Fonseka currently holds the position of Chairman of the SJB.
