COLOMBO (News 1st); Police Spokesman Senior Superintendent of Police Attorney Nihal Thalduwa said the Police officer who shot a person in Dampalassa, Narammala acted recklessly.

He said the relevant officer has also acted contrary to the directives issued for Police officers.

A special investigation unit of the Police has been deployed to Narammala, following the tragic death of a lorry driver during an encounter with police officers on Thursday (18).

The incident, involving the alleged accidental discharge of a firearm carried by a Sub-Inspector, has sparked concern.

Tennakoon assured swift action, stating, "Stern action will be taken against those responsible, following a thorough investigation."

The incident unfolded when two plainclothes Police officers in Narammala attempted to pull over a small lorry.

The driver, however, reportedly ignored their instructions, prompting the officers to pursue him on a motorcycle.

The chase culminated in Dampalassa, where the lorry was finally stopped.

According to Police Spokesman SSP and Attorney-At-Law Nihal Thalduwa, while inspecting the vehicle, the firearm carried by the Sub-Inspector discharged striking and fatally injuring the 40-year-old driver, identified as a resident of Alawwa.

The Sub-Inspector has been arrested and is currently detained pending further investigation.

News of the driver's death triggered protests outside the Narammala Police Station, necessitating the intervention of the Police Special Task Force to restore order.

The body of the 40-year-old resident of Alawwa, who died due to gunshot wounds, has been placed at the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital.
