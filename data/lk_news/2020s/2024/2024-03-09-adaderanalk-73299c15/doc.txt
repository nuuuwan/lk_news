Citing figures from Sri Lanka Customs, the PublicFinance.lk revealed that sanitary napkins are subjected to unreasonably high taxes in Sri Lanka, which amounts to 47.1% as opposed to 30.6% on gold jewellery, 22.3% raw silk, and 22.3% golf clubs, golf balls and military artillery weapons.

Meanwhile, a recent survey has made an alarming revelation about period poverty in Sri Lanka. As per the study, 40% of menstruating women and girls in Sri Lanka have stopped using menstrual products against the backdrop of the ongoing economic crisis.

Accordingly, in 2019, as many as 2.1 million Sri Lankan women aged between 15 and 47 years had not used menstrual products due to high prices.

The study showed that this figure will likely see a sharp rise as the cost of living continues to soar due to the economic crisis.
