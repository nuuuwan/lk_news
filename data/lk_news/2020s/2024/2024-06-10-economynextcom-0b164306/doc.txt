Sri Lanka to send 6,000 workers to Japan

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will send around 6,000 workers to Japan over the course of the year, a Ministry of Labor official has said.

“We are sending caregivers, construction workers, and workers in the agriculture sector to Japan,” Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara’s spokesman, Sanjaya Nallaperuma told EconomyNext.

“So far we have sent 3,223 workers to Japan, in 2023 we sent 5,647 workers, and in 2022 we sent 4,518 workers,” Nallaperuma said. “We will send around 6,000 workers this year.”

“The salary for skilled workers in Japan is high,” Nallaperuma said. “A skilled worker will get an estimated 5 lakhs in Sri Lankan rupees.”

Sri Lanka has been focusing on sending skilled migrant workers following Nanayakkara’s announcement that the country will phase out sending ‘housemaids’, who are considers unskilled and earn less.

The government also plans to send 10,000 workers to South Korea this year in the production, fishing and construction industries. Sri Lanka also is sending workers to warring Israel.

Workers sent to Japan will have to pass the required standards in a Japanese language proficiency test. (Colombo/Jun10/2024)
