Serendib Flour Mills (SFML), a cornerstone of Sri Lanka’s food industry, celebrated over 15 years of purposefully nourishing the nation with a gala event held on 5 December, at the Taj Samudra Hotel. The evening was a significant corporate milestone in SFML’s journey of transforming Sri Lanka’s wider food ecosystem since its establishment in 2008.

The celebration was graced by Board of Investment Chairman Arjuna Herath and Al Ghurair Foods UAE CEO Turgut Yeğenağa alongside other distinguished guests from the industry. The audience included the members of the Serendib distribution network, financial providers, key customers, staff and well-wishers.

In his address, SFML CEO Vijay Sharma reflected on the company’s journey and unwavering commitment to quality and innovation in Sri Lanka’s bakery and food industry.

“Over the past 15 years, SFML’s legacy has remained steadfast in our pursuit towards quality and innovation in Sri Lanka’s food sector. Throughout the journey, we have focused on ensuring consistent quality production, strengthening food security, and delivering nutritious products that nourish communities across the nation. We are grateful for the continued trust and support of our partners and customers,” stated Vijay Sharma.

A highlight of the evening was the unveiling of SFML’s newly redesigned retail pack range. The modernised packaging represents a fresh chapter for the company’s popular ‘7 Star’ retail range, which has been the first choice among households and home bakers since its introduction in 2012. The refreshed designs align with contemporary market trends while maintaining the brand’s commitment to quality.
