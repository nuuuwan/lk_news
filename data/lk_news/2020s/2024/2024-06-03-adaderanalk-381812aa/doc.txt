SC postpones petitions filed over deferral of 2023 LG polls

The Supreme Court has adjourned further hearings on the Fundamental Rights (FR) petitions filed against the postponement of the 2023 Local Government elections, which was initially scheduled to be held on March 09, 2023.

The bench, noting the absence of one of its members today (June 03), ordered the adjournment of the petitions’ hearing until June 05.

The relevant petitions have been filed by the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA), and People’s Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL), seeking an order declaring that the fundamental human rights of the people have been violated by the failure to hold the 2023 LG elections, as previously scheduled.
