India funds Sri Lanka smart classroom project in estates

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will construct 60 smart classrooms at selected schools in estates in Nuwara-Eliya, Kandy and Badulla Districts with funding from the Indian Government, Cabinet Spokesperson Minister Bandula Gunawardena said.

“The Indian Government is helping us financially to develop the quality of education in science, technology and mathematics for Advanced Level classes in the estate sector,” Gunawardena told reporters on Wednesday.

Minister of Estate Infrastructure Jeevan Thondaman has said that despite new schools, including an English medium school, built in the hill country, challenges remain in obtaining permission from plantation companies to expand the schools. (Colombo/Jul10/2024)
