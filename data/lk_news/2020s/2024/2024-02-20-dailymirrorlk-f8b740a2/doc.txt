Wimal questions Harinâ€™s statement in India

Parliament, Feb. 20 (Daily Mirror)- The government must inform Parliament wether the statement made by Tourism Minister Harin Fernando in India that Sri Lanka was part of India was the government's official stance or his personal opinion, Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa said.

He told Parliament that the Minister had stated in India that Sri Lanka was a part of India and the three airports will be given to India.

"The govenment must reveal if the Minister's statement is the official stance of the government or the collective stance of the Cabinet or the Minister's personal opinion. "Can a Minister make such a statement while represnting a country?" he asked.

Chief Government Whip Prasanna Ranatunga said the Cabinet had not discussed any such matter and said the Minister concerned will make a statement in Parliament.

Minister Manusha Nanayakkara said social media had twisted the Minister's statement and said if someone listens to his full statment, his idea would become clear.

"The Minister requested the Indians to visit Sri Lanka while pointing out the historical and traditional relationship between the two countries," he said.

Weerawansa said the Minister had not refuted his statement and said he should make an official statement regarding his remarks made in India.
