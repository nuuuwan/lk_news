Several spells of showers expected in parts of the country

The Department of Meteorlogy says several spells of showers will occur in Western, Sabaragamuwa and North-western provinces and in Kandy, Nuwara-Eliya, Galle and Matara districts.

Showers or thundershowers may occur at a few places in Uva province and in Ampara and Batticaloa districts during the evening or night, it said.

Strong winds of about 40-45 kmph can be expected at times over the western slopes of the central hills and in Northern, North-central, North-western and Southern provinces and in Trincomalee, Matale and Monaragala districts.

The general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
