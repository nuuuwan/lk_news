The Colombo - Wellawaya main road has been completely blocked due to a public demonstration staged this morning, Ada Derana reporter said.

The locals of the area have launched the protest, obstructing vehicular movement on the road at the Weherayaya area of Wellawaya, demanding solutions to the human-elephant conflict in the area.

As a result, traffic congestion ensued in the section of the Colombo - Wellawaya main road blocked by the protesters, according to the reporter.

However, the protesting local residents stated that they will continue the demonstration until a positive solution is received to their issues.
