SLPP to take disciplinary action against G.L. Peiris

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has decided to take disciplinary action against MP Prof. G. L. Peiris, the party’s general secretary Sagara Kariyawasam said.

According to him, the decision was reached by the executive committee of SLPP after taking into account the fact that he entered into an electoral pact with the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB).

Earlier this month, a group of six dissident SLPP parliamentarians, who are now members of the Freedom People’s Congress (Nidahasa Janatha Sabhawa), signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the SJB.

The agreement was inked between the main opposition and six MPs of Nidahasa Janatha Sabhawa including Prof. G.L. Peiris, Dilan Perera, Dr. Nalaka Godahewa, K.P. Kumarasiri, Dr. Upul Galappaththi and Wasantha Yapa Bandara, to form the SJB-led new alliance, ‘Samagi Jana Sandhanaya’.

These MPs, who were elected to the parliament from SLPP, later defected from the party and decided to sit independently in the House. They recently entered into an electoral pact with the main opposition to form a new alliance.
