Dialog customers contribute over Rs. 18 million to Little Hearts via Star Points

Over Rs. 140 million donated via Star Points to Little Hearts project since 2016

Dialog customers came together extending their support once again to contribute over Rs. 18 million towards Little Hearts, an initiative spearheaded by the Sri Lanka College of Pediatricians, bringing the total donation amount since 2016 to Rs. 140 million. The program aims to develop a 12-storey cardiac and critical care complex at Lady Ridgeway Hospital in aid of children with heart diseases and critical illnesses.

This donation will significantly contribute in the provision of life-saving healthcare to children in need, specifically to the facility which will feature four cardiac theatres, a catheterisation laboratory, over 100 cardiac, medical and neonatal intensive care beds, a bone marrow transplant unit, and advanced cardiac investigation and training facilities. In addition to causes such as Little Hearts, Dialog customers also donated to numerous charities such as SOS Children’s Villages Sri Lanka, HelpAge Sri Lanka, Kidney Association, UNICEF, Manudam Mehewara and more, bringing the total donation in 2023 amount to almost Rs. 22 Million.

Commenting, Dialog Axiata PLC Group Chief Customer Officer Sandra De Zoysa said, “We are truly grateful to our customers who have come together once again to contribute their Star Points to causes such as Little Hearts and other philanthropic initiatives. As a testament to Dialog’s continuous commitment to enrich and empower Sri Lankan lives, we have witnessed first-hand the profound impact that collective action can have on those in need”.
