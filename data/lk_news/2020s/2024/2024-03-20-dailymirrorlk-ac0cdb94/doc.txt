Viyath Maga’ member behind move to stop Adani group’s wind power project: Minister

Parliament, March 20 (Daily Mirror)- A member of 'Viyath Maga' who is now working with Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa is behind the move to prevent the implementation of the Adani Group’s wind power project, Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera told Parliament.

Responding to a question raised by the Leader of the Opposition, the Minister said former member of Viyath Maga Rohan Pethiyagoda is one of the persons who has come out against the proposed wind power project.

“Professor Pethiyagoda is an advisor to the Opposition Leader. He is a former member of Viyath Maga,” the Minister said.

He said Professor Pethiyagoda is one of the few who had raised an environment issue pertaining to the wind power project.

“We have taken steps to remove six turbines which belong to wind power plants which are already existing in Mannar. We will also keep a 2 km corridor for bird migration,” the Minister said.

Referring to the proposed unit price of power, the Minister said the matter is under negotiation at the moment.

“We have not made the final decision on the matter," he said.

It was also highlighted that the opinion of the residents have been sought with regard to the proposed project.
