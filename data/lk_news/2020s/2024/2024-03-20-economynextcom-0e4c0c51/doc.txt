NPP’s AKD calls Sri Lanka speaker a parasite

ECONOMYNEXT – Leader of the National People’s Power, Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the speaker of Sri Lanka’s parliament is a parasite that acts on behalf of the government.

“He has brought his entire family into parliament,” Dissanayake said Wednesday during the no-confidence debate against speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena. Dissanayake read out several names of the alleged family members employed in the speaker’s office.

“An entire Yapa generation (paramparavak) is here,” Dissanayake said, “One of his sons is the Development Lotteries Board chairman.”

“Because he is beholden to the executive, he acts as a parasite.”

Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva who followed Dissanayake in speaking said that the speaker had erred in giving too much time for the opposition and this was a case of ‘biting the hand that feeds them’.

He also said the NPP were wolves in sheep’s clothing. (Colombo/Mar20/2024)
