Ten families from Ella evacuated due to impending landslide danger

Steps were taken last morning to evacuate ten families from Karandagolla in Ella due to the danger of an impending landslide.

Ella Divisional Secretary Indika Gayan Pathirana said the flow of muddy water and cracks in the hill had been noticed earlier, and they had developed despite the prevailing dry weather, signalling the possibility of a disastrous situation that required the evacuation of families from the high risk area.

He said the National Building and Research Organisation (NBRO) carried out an inspection and recommended the evacuation of ten families.

The Divisional Secretary further said the displaced families were provided with temporary shelter and necessary facilities.
