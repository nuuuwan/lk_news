Indian High Commissioner visits Southern Province

Indian High Commissioner Santosh Jha became the first Indian High Commissioner in recent times to undertake a standalone visit to Southern Province, as he held diverse engagements in Galle, Matara and Hambantota Districts on 6 to 7 March.

The High Commissioner met the Governor of the Province Dr. Willie Gamage on 6 March and highlighted several projects undertaken by Government of India (GOI) in the region. He also expressed willingness to carry out more projects for the benefit of the people in the Province through grant assistance as well as investments. The Governor thanked the High Commissioner for GOI’s diverse initiatives.

The High Commissioner paid floral tributes at the bust of Rabindranath Tagore, installed in the auditorium named after Gurudev Tagore in University of Ruhuna. With a seating capacity of 1500 people, this is the largest auditorium in any Sri Lankan University. It may be recalled this facility, built through GOI grant assistance, was inaugurated in 2018. During an interactive session with the Vice Chancellor and faculty heads of the University, the High Commissioner expressed interest in closer educational collaborations and conveyed willingness to further support the University in multiple ways.

GOI is currently implementing two dedicated housing projects, covering around 50 villages in Galle, Matara and Hambantota Districts. GOI has committed to build 1200 housing units for the homeless, landless and low-income people under these two projects. The High Commissioner visited two villages in Hambantota District to take stock of progress of these two project sites.

High Commissioner Santosh Jha’s visit to Southern Province underscored the enduring cultural linkages between India and Sri Lanka. He sought the blessings of Lord Buddha at the sacred Dondra, Katragama and Tissamaharama Temples and prayed for further strengthening of ties between the people of India and Sri Lanka.
