Sri Lanka workers in Maldives turn to Undiyal as banks limit dollars: legislator

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka workers in the Maldives have to rely on Undiyal to send remittances home, as banks have limited dollar sales to customers amid forex shortages, a legislator told State Minister for Finance Shehan Semasinghe, seeking his intervention.

Data showed that the Maldive’s Monetary Authority’s domestic assets had risen over the past several months resulting in reserve losses as the liquidity pushed up dollar demand.

A large number of Sri Lankans work in the Maldives in high executive jobs in the hospitality sector in other categories including and labourers and housemaids.

“There are many Sri Lankans working in high level jobs in the Maldives,” ruling party legislator Weerasumana Weerasinghe told State Minister for Finance Shehan Semasinghe.

“They are paid in Maldives rufiyaa, which are deposited in banks there. Two of our banks, Commercial and Bank of Ceylon is there. There are people getting 1,000 to 3,000 dollars a month there, but they can send only 250 dollars or 300 back.

“Commercial Bank gives 300 and Bank of Ceylon only 250 dollars according to the limits they have set. So they have to send through Undiyal. So I am directing your attention to this matter.

Bank of Ceylon is a state bank, commercial bank is also one that is under some regulation, so I am asking for your intervention to help send these remittances here.”

Forex shortages emerge when activist macro-economists or inflationists running reserve collecting central banks print money to closely target a policy rate or interbank/call money rate with various inflationary liquidity tools (open market operations or standing facilities).

The Maldives Monetary Authority as the least activist monetary authority in South Asia does not usually target a policy rate and can therefore provide stability to the nation to grow and import labour, as Sri Lanka did before a central bank was set up in 1950.

One of the early actions of the Central Bank of Ceylon to curb economic freedoms of residents was to instigate limits on outward remittances of guest workers in the island, who had come during the operation of a currency board arrangement.

“Thank you for drawing attention to this matter,” Minister Semasinghe responded. “We will look into this matter and reply.”

The Maldives rufiyaa is the strongest currency in the region at 15.40 to the US dollar compared to 330 in Sri Lanka from the original 4.76 to the dollar and the country also has the highest per capita GDP and is a source of tourists to Sri Lanka as well as remittances.

Maldives-based Adadhu.com news portal said the kerb rate ranged as much as 18 rufiyaa to the Us dollar and banks.

“Dollar shortage is a serious problem in the Maldives,” the report said. “Despite a de facto exchange rate of MVR 15.42, most people are forced to buy dollars from the black market, where prices range from MVR 16 to MVR 18 per dollar.”

The report said banks were not providing dollar for telegraphic transfers on time to customers.

Money is South Asia is derived from the India rupee at 4.70 to the US dollar (before the RBI was nationalized and activist policy started to re-finance Gos-plan style 5-year programs).

MMA’s standing lending facility to create new rufiyaa to banks is 10 percent compared to 1.5 percent deposit rate, discouraging money printing and keeping inflation around 1 to 3 percent with a fairly credible peg.

However, the MMA got the ability to engage in open market operations over a decade ago (monetary policy modernization) and also provide advances to the government triggering forex shortages from time to time.

If open market operations are used to fill (sterilize) liquidity shortages from dollar interventions, forex shortages can continue and the peg can break, as an economy recovers and credit demand goes up.

In 2023, MMAs’s domestic assets started to rise as money was printed (some provisional advances were also converted to bonds) and forex shortages started to emerge.

Maldive’s gross official reserves which were at 795 million US dollars in February 2023 has since fallen to 588 million US dollars as money was printed.

MMA’s domestic assets went from around 11.9 billion rufiyaa to 14.6 billon rufiyaa over the past three quarter.

Maldives is also partly dollarized, reducing the burden on the rufiyaa monetary system somewhat. However monetary policy modernization, continued liquidity injections could lead to worse external problems, trigger downgrades and lead to default.

Undiyal payment can also help as it is effectively a floating exchange rate, which does not require the MMA to sterilize any reserve sales with new money and worsen a currency crisis. (Colombo/Jan24/2024)
