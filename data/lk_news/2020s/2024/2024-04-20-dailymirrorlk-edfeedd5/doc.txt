Vehicle importers call for increased space for importing used vehicles

Colombo, April 20 (Daily Mirror) - President of the Vehicle Importers Association of Lanka (VIAL), Indika Sampath Merinchige urged the government to expand the allowance for importing used vehicles alongside new ones.

He emphasized the need to extend the timeframe for importing used vehicles from three years to seven years or beyond.
