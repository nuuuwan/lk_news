KOICA partners  Sri Lanka to improve solid waste management and circular economy

In a significant move to advance environmental sustainability, the Government of Sri Lanka and the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) formalised their partnership today with the signing of the “Developing Sustainable Integrated Solid Waste Management Project in Uva and Northern Provinces” in Sri Lanka.

The event, held at the Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government (MoPCLG), was graced by the presence of KOICA Sri Lanka Office Country Director Kim Myung Jin, MoPCLG Secretary Alokabandara, Department of External Resources Director General Samantha Bandara, other dignitaries, and representatives from Government institutions.

Under the project, KOICA will invest $ 11 million to address the growing challenges of solid waste management in the Badulla and Vavuniya districts. The initiative aims to strengthen the capacity of Sri Lankan officials, introduce best practices in solid waste management from Korea, and enhance the infrastructure of waste management.

Alokabandara stated: “This partnership with KOICA will become a significant step in addressing Sri Lanka’s solid waste management challenges which may lead to longer-term sustainable outcomes, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, leading to a behavioural change towards eco-friendly waste management practices.”

Further, Kim added: “This project exemplifies KOICA’s commitment to advance global partnerships for environmental protection. We are confident that our bilateral ties with Sri Lanka will drive Sri Lanka’s waste management sector to a more sustainable path.”

Over the next five years, KOICA plans to invest more than $ 65 million to strengthen climate change mitigation and adaptation technologies in Sri Lanka.
