Teachersâ€™ trade union to launch action from Kandy

A trade union action is set to be launched from Kandy on Tuesday (20) by the Ceylon Teachers' Union (CTU), demanding the government to fulfill its promise of granting the remaining salary increment.

General Secretary of the CTU, Joseph Stalin, addressing the media said that while the government had granted one-third of the installment, they had not specified a timeline for providing the balance.

"We received only a fraction of the promised increment after enduring 120 days of aragalaya. The soaring cost of living has made it increasingly difficult to make ends meet. With no indication of further progress, we are left with no choice but to resume our protest," Stalin emphasized.

The demonstration, slated to commence from Kandy, is expected to witness the active participation of teachers, principals and teacher trainers alike.
