Sri Lanka, Singapore officials discuss trade cooperation, supermarkets

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Trade, Commerce and Food Security Minister met Singapore’s Non-Resident High Commissioner to discuss increasing trade and investment relations between the two countries.

High Commissioner Chandra Das invited minister Nalin Fernando “to visit the NTUC supermarket chain in Singapore as it would provide insight into running Sri Lanka’s supermarket chains, including Lanka Sathosa,” a statement by the Department of Government Information said.

NTUC FairPrice is the largest supermarket chain in Singapore with more than 60% market share.

Fernando pointed out that post-harvest damage was very high in Sri Lanka and asked for Singapore’s help with technical knowledge to store sufficient stocks for long periods of time.

To maintain food security, farmers should be properly coordinated through institutions such as cooperatives and provincial councils, Das said, adding that he was ready to provide facilities including investments to increase production.

The Sri Lanka-Singapore trade agreement and new opportunities were also discussed at length.  (Colombo/Jan31/2024).
