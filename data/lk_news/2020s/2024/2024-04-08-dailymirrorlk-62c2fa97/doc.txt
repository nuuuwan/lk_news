SJB leaders wonâ€™t be able to hold their positions if party membership loses faith: Fonseka

Colombo, April 8 (Daily Mirror) - The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leaders will not be able to hold on to their positions for long if the membership lose their faith in them, MP Sarath Fonseka said today.

"Party leaders should think of their party membership and not their personal success," Fonseka told the media.

"A few in the SJB want to push me out, but I am not scared of them. I am a man who has confronted political giants like Mahinda Rajapaksa," he said.

He also said former President Maithripala Sirisena should not be taken seriously.

"Former President Sirisena is not focusing on issues faced by the people but playing practical jokes," he added.
