Further honoring Jayakodi's service, the late constable was posthumously promoted to the rank of sergeant yesterday (26).

The driver of the jeep involved in the accident was arrested on charges of reckless driving and failure to avoid an accident. He is currently receiving treatment at the Ragama Teaching Hospital.
