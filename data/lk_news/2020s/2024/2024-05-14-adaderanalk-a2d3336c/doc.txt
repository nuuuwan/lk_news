Preschooler dies of electric shock while using charging mobile phone

Pediatrician Dr. Deepal Perera says there is a 3 – 15% chance that a child can die due to electrocution.

“It can affect the heart. It can affect the brain. That means it can damage the nervous system. The heart rate can change. We call it arrhythmia. Things like that can happen. Fainting, loss of consciousness, and even death can occur. This is very dangerous,” Dr. Perera warned.

Therefore, he stressed that it is the duty of adults to immediately rush them to hospital when such incidents occur as well as to prevent such situation from arising.

Meanwhile, a tragic incident has been reported from the Munhena area of Maggona, where a three-and-a-half-year-old girl has died allegedly due to electrocution while using a mobile phone that was plugged into a charger.

The girl, who had returned home from preschool, was using a mobile phone while it was charging in a room of the house. Her elder brother discovered her lying unconscious and immediately alerted their father.

Despite efforts to revive her, she was pronounced following admission to the Beruwala Base Hospital.

Preliminary investigations have uncovered that the girl was electrocuted after coming into contact with an unsafe power supply. The severity of the electric shock was evident from the bruises observed on the child’s chest area, suggesting she had held the charging mobile phone against her body.
