Several spells of showers expected in parts of Sri Lanka

The Meteorology Department forecasts that several spells of showers will occur in Western, Sabaragamuwa and North-western provinces and in Galle and Matara districts.

Showers or thundershowers may occur at a few places in Uva Province and in Ampara and Batticaloa districts in the evening or night.

Strong winds of about 40-50 kmph can be expected at times over the Western slopes of the central hills, Northern, North-central, and North-western provinces and in Trincomalee, Hambantota and Monaragala districts.

The general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
