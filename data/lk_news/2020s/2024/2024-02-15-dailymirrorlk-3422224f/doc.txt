No one can bring down hospital system except for doctors, nurses

Colombo, Feb 15 (Daily Mirror) - Apart from medical professionals such as doctors and nurses, no one has the capability to collapse the hospital system. If such an occurrence does happen for two days, the subsequent consequences are unpredictable, Government Medical Officers' Forum (GMOF) president Dr. Rukshan Bellana said.

Addressing the media, he said that the leaders of these trade unions were affiliated with higher officials attached to the Trade Union Division of the President's office.

"We have repeatedly said that the services of healthcare workers are no longer needed in hospitals. Another unsuccessful strike has been concluded. Hospitals only need the expertise of professionals from health trade unions, including doctors, nurses, and administrative staff. These ineffective trade unions cannot overthrow the government," he stated.

"As a result of this protest, significant developments occurred for the government. The protesters asserted that at least 100,000 health workers participated in the protest, risking the loss of their allowances for four days. Consequently, these demonstrators contributed to saving approximately Rs. 700 million for the government. Those who did not participate in the trade union action will receive their allowances, scheduled to be disbursed in April, allowing them to celebrate the upcoming Sinhala and Tamil New Year joyfully. However, the protesters are expected to have a less favorable start to the new year," he remarked.

"I think that the government can save more money if they participate in another two or three protests in the future.

"However, some approved allowances from the government should be given to nurses," said Dr. Bellana and requested the President to take immediate action to grant approved allowances to nurses.
