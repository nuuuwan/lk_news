SLFP internal crisis intensifies: Sirisena responds to injunction over CBK’s plaint

Former President Maithripala Sirisena says he expects to present facts before the court with regard to the interim injunction issued by the Colombo District Court, preventing him from functioning as the Chairman of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).

The Colombo District Court on Thursday (04) issued an interim injunction preventing Sirisena from functioning as the SLFP chairman, following a complaint filed by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.

Speaking to the media this evening (04), Sirisena said: “I got to know in the afternoon that Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike has obtained an interim injunction to remove me from the chairmanship [of SLFP]. I only saw on media that the injunction is effective until April 18.”

The former President also said that he has not been officially informed of the order in writing as of yet.

“These types of challenges are not new in the history of the SLFP. Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike, Mr. Kumaratunga, Mr. Anura Bandaranaike… they have all separated from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and formed new parties.  After Mrs. Bandaranaike’s civic rights were stripped in 1977, we had to remain in the opposition for 17 years due to such actions by them”, he added.

“Regardless of the challenges we face, we, as a steadfast group within the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, will conduct future political activities independently of the ruling party. In the future, we will present the facts before the court and also inform the people of the exact situation”, Sirisena expressed.
