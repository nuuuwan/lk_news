Sri Lanka President allocates Rs5bn for general elections

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s three-member cabinet, which includes the president, has approved President Anura Dissanayake’s proposal to release 5 billion rupees from the government’s consolidated fund for conducting the general election.

“The 2024 budget had only set aside money for one election,” newly appointed Cabinet spokesman minister Vijitha Herath said. “There wasn’t money allocated for a general election.”

Under Sri Lanka’s constitution, powers are vested in the president, by Article 150(4), to issue funds from the consolidated fund.

The Cabinet also approved the allocation of another 6 billion rupees from the 2025 budget through a Vote on Account expected to be submitted to the Parliament. (Colombo/Oct1/2024)
