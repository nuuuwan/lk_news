SLT-Mobitel has once again raised the bar with the launch of its highly anticipated 2025 calendar, this year dedicated to the mesmerizing world of Sri Lanka’s dragonflies and damselflies.

Themed “Dragonflies of Sri Lanka,” this calendar continues the 19-year tradition of highlighting the island’s natural and cultural heritage, making it one of the most sought-after annual publications in the country, SLT Chief Executive Officer Janaka Abeysinghe said, speaking at the launch on Thursday at the SrI Lanka Telecom Headquarters in Colombo,

This year’s calendar focuses on the vibrant and captivating world of dragonflies, showcasing their stunning beauty and highlighting their crucial role in maintaining the health of ecosystems countrywide.

Prabhath Dahanayake, the Chief Marketing Officer of SLT-Mobitel, explained the initiative’s purpose, stating, “As a purpose-driven national brand, SLT-Mobitel goes beyond connecting people digitally. We are committed to fostering a deeper appreciation for nature. With this calendar, we hope to inspire a conversation around conservation and sustainability, furthering our commitment to environmental stewardship.”

He said that `The Dragonflies of Sri Lanka’ calendar serves not only as a beautiful visual experience but also as an educational tool. Each month features detailed information about the life cycle of these remarkable creatures and their ecological role. It highlights the rich biodiversity that Sri Lanka offers and underscores the importance of protecting its natural heritage.

Amila Sumanapala, a renowned field researcher who has done extensive studies on dragonflies and damselflies at the Department of Zoology and Environmental Science at the University of Colombo, served as a resource person for the project, providing valuable scientific insights into the subject matter. His expertise has added depth and accuracy to the calendar’s portrayal of dragonflies.

The Chief Marketing Officer also said for nearly two decades, SLT-Mobitel’s annual calendars have become a tradition, serving as a platform for showcasing Sri Lanka’s environmental and cultural treasures. The 2025 Dragonflies of Sri Lanka calendar is no exception, furthering the company’s legacy of encouraging public engagement in environmental preservation.

The calendar features stunning artistic depictions of Sri Lanka’s dragonflies, brought to life by a talented panel of artists including Pulasthi Ediriweera, Parami Vidyarathna, and Udeshika Priyadarshani. These exquisite illustrations are complemented by the creative expertise of SLT-Mobitel’s Marketing Group, led by Anne Fernando, Vajira Hapuhinna and H.K. Sanjeevan Sathyajith.

The young scientists stressed the importance of raising awareness about these remarkable creatures, stating: “This calendar is not just an artistic endeavor but a celebration of the intricate connections between our natural world and its preservation.”

The creation of the calendar is a testament to the synergy between experts and artists. Months of research and collaboration ensured that every detail of the dragonflies—ranging from their unique anatomical features to their habitats—was captured with precision and artistry.

For the environmentally conscious and tech-savvy, the calendar is also available as an e-calendar, providing broader access and promoting sustainability. It can be accessed at SLT-Mobitel Calendar 2025.

Sumanapala also said dragonflies, often referred to as the ‘Guardians of the Watersheds,’ play a vital ecological role as apex predators in aquatic habitats. They are key indicators of water quality and overall ecosystem health, with their presence or absence offering valuable insights into the environmental conditions around them. As Sri Lanka boasts over 132 species of dragonflies, including 59 endemic species, these insects are not only a captivating sight but also a flagship group in conservation efforts.
