Anura Kumara warns of possible conspiracies ahead of polls

Presidential candidate of the National People’s Power (NPP), Anura Kumara Dissanayake, has warned of the possibility of attempts by certain elements to engage in conspiracies in the next couple of days, ahead of the country’s presidential election.

He revealed this while speaking during Ada Derana’s special “Derana 360°” program series for the presidential candidates, which was aired on TV Derana yesterday (16).

“Definitely our aim in this election campaign was to gain power. We are able to win.” He stated that they have nothing new planned for the next two days and that their expectation is to present their facts again and again, as well as to present facts to society regarding the “criticisms and possible conspiracies against us from the side of the government and Sajith’s camp.”

“You may have seen that most of the time in our country, even though the election process continues like this, certain unexpected incidents occur. Therefore, there is speculation among the citizens. An SJB parliamentarian spoke on two occasions about the danger of a disturbance. At the same time, we saw an incident reported at Jayawardenepura University,” he said.

“Therefore, they may have an expectation of creating a conflict situation in the society in a conspiratorial manner.”

He stated that it is up to them to expose that and to request their supporters not to get involved in any such conflict in any way, as well as to urge the police and the armed forces to prevent the spread of such things through the powers vested in them if any conflict occurs.
