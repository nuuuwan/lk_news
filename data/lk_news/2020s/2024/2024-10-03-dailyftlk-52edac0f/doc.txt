India’s External Affairs Minister in town tomorrow

Indian External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar is expected to visit Sri Lanka tomorrow (4) and call on President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

His visit to Colombo would mark the first by any foreign diplomat after President took office on 23 September.

Dr. Jaishankar’s visit will be closely watched as it will include high-level engagement between India and Sri Lanka.
