In a concerted effort to empower the educational landscape of Sri Lanka, LOLC Divi Saviya proudly announces the continuation of its Phase 03 initiative coinciding with the reopening of schools subsequent to the New Year holidays. Following the success of its previous phases, this endeavour reaffirms LOLC›s commitment to nurturing the dreams and aspirations of the nation›s youth.

As Phase 03 progresses, LOLC Divi Saviya aims to expand its reach to schools nationwide, with a specific focus on those accommodating 101-150 students. This ambitious expansion initiative is poised to encompass over 40% of schools in Sri Lanka, marking a significant milestone as the initiative surpasses 4000 schools reached.

Distribution activities for Phase 03 resumed on 25 April at Sri Indrajothi Vidyalaya, Battaramulla, with the participation of LOLC Holdings PLC Group Managing Director Kapila Jayawardena, and Chief Operating Officer Kithsiri Gunawardena.
