Minister orders inquiry into male zebra’s death at Dehiwala Zoo

Colombo, March 15 (Daily Mirror) -  Wildlife and Forest Conservation Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi has ordered an inquiry into the unexpected death of the only male zebra at the National Zoological Garden in Dehiwala.

It was reported that the zebra died while being brought from Ridiyagama Safari Park to Dehiwala Zoo for breeding purposes four days earlier.

The zebra was received by the county from China via an animal exchange programme six years ago, and it was taken to the Ridiyagama Safari Park.

The male zebra was brought to the Dehiwala zoo for breeding purposes, and there are only two female zebras living in the zoo.

The Dehiwala Zoo employees claimed that the zebra died due to overdosing on some medicines given to it while on its way to the zoo. The employees held a protest at the Dehiwala Zoo, demanding an impartial inquiry over the sudden death of the only zebra.

The employees claimed that the animal was given a total of 47 1450 mg tablets on its way. The animal was received by the zoo last Friday, and when it arrived, the animal was not in a stable health condition.

Meanwhile, the Dehiwala Zoological Director, General Ranjan Marasinghe, claimed that he could not take action over the veterinary doctor's reasoning for the death of an animal. I requested the Wildlife and Forest Conservation Ministry Secretary to appoint an independent investigative team to inquire into the sudden death of the animal.

Moreover, environmentalist Nayanaka Ranwella said information is being reviewed to prove the sudden death of the only zebra was a kill. This semi-wild animal was caged last Thursday (7), and Ranwella claimed that the box used to transport his animal was not suitable for transport. He blamed the Ridiyagama Safari Park officials for not following proper methods to capture and transport the animal.

The skin of the animal was damaged in an area, and several wounds were seen on its body after bringing it to the Dehiwala Zoo.
