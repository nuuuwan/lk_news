Church skeptical on CID questioning Maithri

Colombo, March 25 (Daily Mirror) - National Catholic Director of Mass Communications Fr. Jude Krishantha yesterday said the church in Sri Lanka has decided to adopt a wait and see policy with regard to action which the authorities would take against former President Maithripala Sirisena despite the assurance given by the CID that it will probe the latter would be questioned on the remark he made on Friday.

Former President Sirisena on Friday said he is aware as to who was behind the Easter Sunday bomb attacks.

“CID has said Mr. Sirisena will be probed but we have to wait and see how it goes,” Fr. Fernando told Daily Mirror.

“Mr Sirisena has actually misled the judiciary as he earlier denied any knowledge about the attacks. However the former President is now saying that he is aware of as to who was behind the Easter Sunday attacks. We call for Sirisena’s arrest,” he said.
