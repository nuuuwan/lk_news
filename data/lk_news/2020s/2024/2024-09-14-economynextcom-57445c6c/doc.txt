Sri Lanka public transport vehicle imports from Oct, trucks from Dec 2024

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet has decided to lift a ban on the import of public transport vehicles from October 01 and goods transport vehicles from December 01, a government statement said.

Special purpose vehicles would also be allowed from October 01.

Passenger vehicles, pick-up trucks and SUVs would be allowed from February 2025.

Sri Lanka’s macroeconomists running the central bank and Treasury banned the import of vehicles and about 3,000 other items from March 2020 as the currency collapsed (flexible exchange rate) after as money was printed for potential output targeting.

Though lockdowns in the next month killed domestic credit and led to a recovery in the currency, forex shortages continued as large volumes of money was printed to enforce a low policy rate and yield curve targeting by scuttling bill auctions with a rate ceilings.

The import bans failed to prevent a balance of payments crisis as the printed money flowed into building materials, machinery and equipment through the credit system.

Banning vehicles imports after inflationary open market operations or other methods to cut rates has been a tactic employed by macroeconomists ever since the central bank was set up in the 1950s.

Critics have described the practice of banning car imports (and other so-called non-essential goods) which leads to a loss tax revenue and more money printing as a ‘cascading policy error’ of Sri Lanka’s macroeconomists and bureaucrats.

Sri Lanka’s central bank is currently running broadly deflationary policy, but analysts have warned that if rate cuts are enforced with liquidity injects, (standing facilities, overnight reverse repo, term or outright purchases of domestic assets), forex shortages will re-emerge.

The central bank has a large stock of bonds, whose coupons are deflationary as long as the call money rate is not targeted with new injections when payments are made by the government. (colombo/Aug14/2024)
