Horton Place to be renamed as Ponnamabalam Arunachalam Mawatha

Colombo, Jan 18 (Daily Mirror) - Residents of Horton Place are up in arms against the proposal by the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) to rename the road as Ponnambalam Arunachalam Mawatha, a resident told Daily Mirror.

One time Mayor of Colombo Omar Kamil said a notice has been distributed to the residents in the area calling for objection against the renaming of the road. “The notice distributed by the CMC says a motion has been passed by the council to rename the road. However one wonders as to why a motion was passed in a situation where the council has ceased to function a year ago,” Mr. Kamil said.

The notice distributed to the residents said a motion has been passed by the CMC to name the road belonging to Kurunduwatte ward within the administration limits of CMC, starting from assessment number 75 of C.W.W. Kannangara Mawatha and assessment no 75 of Horton Place and terminates between assessment number 11 and 120 of Horton place as Ponnambalam Arunachalam Mawatha.

“We wonder how the road can be renamed when there is an avenue named Ponnambalam Arunachalam Avenue close by. This is small avenue is off Horton place,” Mr. Kamil added.

Former Member of CMC Shermila Gonawala who was commenting on the matter said no such motion was brought to the council during the days when it was functioning. “Some ladies living down Horton place called me many times and requested me to stop this move. They say they will have to go through the hassle of getting their various documents changed,” she said.
