Lanka Sathosa to import 2,000 MT of big onions

Sri Lanka has decided to import big onions from India through Lanka Sathosa.

India recently decided to send a stock of 10,000 metric tonnes of onion to Sri Lanka after lifting the export ban on onions for the island nation, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi government’s ‘Neighbourhood First Policy’.

Accordingly, discussions were held at the Ministry of Trade whether to carry out the big onion imports through state or private sector and it was decided to import onions through Lanka Sathosa.

When inquired by Ada Derana, Chairman of Lanka Sathosa Pasanda Yapa Abeywardena said that 2,000 metric tonnes of big onions would be imported as the initial stock.

Nevertheless, Minister of Trade Nalin Fernando emphasized that the monthly big onions requirement of Sri Lanka is around 20,000 metric tonnes.
