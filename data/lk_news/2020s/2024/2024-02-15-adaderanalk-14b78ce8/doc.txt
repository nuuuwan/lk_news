President invites all parties to collaborate for national development

President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Thursday (Feb.15) emphasized the necessity of unity for national development, stating that political divisions hinder progress.

Furthermore, he has extended an invitation to all parties to collaborate, not for their respective political affiliations, but to enhance the quality of life for the people of the nation, according to the President’s Media Division (PMD).

He made these remarks during the inauguration of the initial phase of the Anuradhapura North Water Supply Project on Thursday morning.

The Head of State underscored that the Anuradhapura North Water Supply Project is designed to safeguard agriculture in the region, addressing concerns during the inauguration of its inaugural phase. He assured farmers that the project not only caters to drinking water needs but also supports agricultural activities, urging them to dismiss any unfounded apprehensions.

This endeavour, executed at a cost of Rs. 11,515 million, was spearheaded by the Ministry of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development, with financial backing from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The project aims to address the long-standing issue of kidney disease-afflicted regions such as Medawachchiya, Padaviya, Kebithigollewa, Horowpathana, and Kahatagasdigiliya, by ensuring access to clean drinking water.

The first phase, cantered around the Anuradhapura Maha Kanadarawa Lake, has already begun serving approximately 25,000 families across 75 village service areas within the Rambewa and Medawachchiya Divisional Secretariat Divisions. President Wickremesinghe assured that this initiative would not compromise local agriculture.

He underscored the dual purpose of the Anuradhapura North Water Supply Project, which not only caters to drinking water needs but also supports agricultural activities. Furthermore, he mentioned plans for the impending Malwatu Oya Reservoir project from the previous administration, indicating the government’s commitment to advancing the North Central Province as a hub for renewable energy.

Minister Jeevan Thondaman has assumed the significant responsibility of ensuring water access to these regions, with more households across the country still in need of such provisions. Additionally, it is imperative to equip the Tamil communities residing in the upcountry regions with essential infrastructure, as development in these areas lags behind. Urgent measures are required to address these issues, a task Mr. Jeevan Thondaman is actively pursuing today.

The Anuradhapura North Water Supply Project commenced in 2013, aiming to alleviate the plight of those afflicted by kidney disease in these regions by providing clean drinking water. Simultaneously, provisions for water crucial to agricultural activities are also being prioritized.

Concerns have been raised regarding potential water loss for agricultural use during project implementation, but assurances have been given that such outcomes will be avoided. Mitigation strategies are in place to safeguard against any adverse effects.

The demand for water is twofold: for agricultural cultivation and residential needs. The challenges faced by individuals, including having to justify their actions to their families after engaging in public campaigns, underscore the pervasive nature of this issue.

I assure you that this project will effectively address both concerns by providing water for agricultural purposes and ensuring access to clean drinking water.

Despite the challenges posed by the recent economic downturn, we persevered to complete this project by securing the necessary funds, a significant obstacle in itself. Taking office in 2022 due to a lack of alternative candidates, we, with the support of various parties, initiated a national reconstruction program amidst challenging circumstances.

Facing scepticism and practical obstacles, such as fertilizer shortages and fuel scarcities, we prioritized resolving these pressing issues before contemplating elections. While substantial progress has been made in revitalizing the economy, our debt burden remains, necessitating a sustained focus on economic revitalization to avoid further borrowing.

Upon assuming leadership, our immediate concern was addressing the populace’s basic needs, including food and fuel shortages. In times of crisis, it is paramount for any government to prioritize meeting these fundamental requirements, as emphasized by Mr. Lenin during the Russian Revolution of 1917, who advocated for “Peace, Land, Bread” before espousing communist ideals.

Initially, our foremost priority was establishing peace and stability throughout the country, a goal that has been realized today. The prevailing environment ensures the rule of law and permits freedom of expression and assembly, allowing citizens to voice criticism and engage in peaceful demonstrations.

Subsequently, our focus shifted to addressing food insecurity by facilitating agricultural activities. Through collaboration with the United States, we acquired fertilizer to boost paddy cultivation, resulting in successful harvests in 2022 and 2023. Additionally, essential food items such as rice and flour were distributed to the populace.

Another critical initiative was the allocation of land, realized through the ‘Urumaya’ program, alongside endeavours to grant ownership of flats in Colombo to eligible individuals.

To foster a robust economy, we embarked on an agricultural modernization program aimed at improving water management and introducing new crops. Historical precedence demonstrates the potential for rice cultivation not only to sustain domestic needs but also to serve as an export commodity, akin to the country’s role as an oriental granary during ancient times.

Had such initiatives been enacted earlier, our nation would not be reliant on external assistance today. Furthermore, efforts have been directed towards attracting new industries and bolstering tourism, recognizing that merely providing food is insufficient. Generating employment opportunities for the youth is imperative, especially considering the lack of job creation in recent years.

To expedite economic progress, foreign investments are crucial, necessitating the formulation of new legislation to facilitate this endeavour. Let us unite in advancing this transformative agenda and collectively propel our nation towards prosperity.

During elections, it’s natural for political factions to diverge, but post-election, there should be avenues for reconciliation and collaboration. We ought to institute a system that allows for such flexibility. The residents of our villages gain nothing from division; hence, I urge everyone to unite for a common cause. Let’s work together, not for any particular political agenda, but for the betterment of our people. Collective efforts will expedite progress significantly.

It’s important to recognize the significance of the water supply project in the North Central region. Additionally, discussions are underway regarding the Malwatu Oya project.

In tandem with these water initiatives, we’re actively exploring the establishment of power plants in the north-central area, leveraging both thermal and wind energy resources. Transforming this province into a major renewable energy hub holds immense potential. Furthermore, proposals for power plants utilizing lake resources are being discussed, promising substantial economic gains. I appeal to all for their support in forging a new economic landscape and securing a prosperous future for our citizens.
