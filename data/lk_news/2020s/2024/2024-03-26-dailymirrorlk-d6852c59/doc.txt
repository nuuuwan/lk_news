Colombo, March 26 (Daily Mirror)- An appeal filed by Minister of Urban Development and Housing Prasanna Ranatunga challenging the Colombo High Court’s decision to impose a suspended imprisonment in connection with the Meethotamulla extortion case was today fixed for inquiry by the Court of Appeal.

The Court of Appeal divisional bench headed by Justice D.N. Samarakoon fixed the matter for inquiry on April 30.

Minister Ranatunga was convicted for the thirteenth count out of fifteen by High Court Judge Manjula Tillekaratne over an indictment filed for threatening a businessman over the phone and demanding Rs. 64 million in 2015. Accordingly, he was sentenced to two years rigorous imprisonment suspended for five years by the Colombo High Court.

The Court further ordered the Minister to pay a fine of Rs. 25 million. The thirteenth count had been filed under Section 373 for extortion in order to execute five promissory notes in a dishonest manner after threatening the businessman.

Through his appeal, Minister Ranatunga stated that he was seeking the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to review and set aside his conviction and the sentence imposed by the Colombo High Court.
