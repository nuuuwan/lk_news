Shanakiyan calls for Viyalendran to resign from Ministerial post

ITAK MP Shanakiyan Rasamanickam accuses State Minister Viyalanderan of being behind a Rs. 6 m bribe

Says Minister must be asked to resign, and President must ensure there is no political influence over the investigation

Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi (ITAK) MP Shanakiyan Rasamanickam has called for the resignation of State Minister of Trade and Environment S. Viyalanderan after the latter’s private Secretary Y. Roshman was arrested over a bribery incident yesterday.

Taking to X, ITAK MP Shanakiyan Rasamanickam said that Roshman was arrested in Batticaloa during a sting operation conducted by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC). He said Roshman was allegedly soliciting a bribe of Rs. 6 million to grant a mining license. Rasamanickam suggested that the suspect had solicited the bribe on behalf of the minister.

“If the President is to have any chance at getting re-elected, he should build the trust of the public by taking action against corruption at least with a few weeks to go for elections. Minister must be asked to resign, and President must ensure there is no political influence in this matter,” he said.

Viyalanderan, a staunch supporter of the Rajapaksas, contested under the SLPP and was elected to Parliament. Recently, he was appointed as the State Minister for Environment by the President, just a few days after pledging his support for him in the upcoming election.
