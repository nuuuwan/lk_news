Underworld figure ‘Midigama Ruwan’ brought back to Sri Lanka

Notorious underworld figure and drug trafficker Ruwan Jayasekara, alias “Midigama Ruwan”, has been brought back to Sri Lanka from Dubai by a team of offices from the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) today, Police Spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa said.

The suspect is accused of being involved in planning the attempt by infamous drug trafficker Nadun Chinthaka alias ‘Harak Kata’ to escape from the CID headquarters in Colombo.

In March, it had been reported that “Midigama Ruwan” had been arrested by the Dubai Police, based on a Interpol warrant, and that he would likely be extradited back to Sri Lanka.

He is considered to be one of the two people who had led Harak Kata’s drug network after the latter’s arrest in Madagascar and extradition to Sri Lanka. He is also said to have planned an attack on the CID head office in Colombo to free drug trafficker Nadun Chinthaka alias ‘Harak Kata’, which was ultimately foiled.
