Delegation from Saudi Fund arrives in Sri Lanka

Saudi Arabian ambassador Khalid bin Hamoud Al-Kahtani  received a delegation from the Development Evaluation Department of the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD) today, a statement from the embassy said.

The visit aims to conduct a post-implementation evaluation of the Epilepsy Hospital and Health Centres project in Sri Lanka, which was implemented by the Ministry of Health at a cost of  USD 75 million, with a contribution from the Saudi Fund for Development amounting to USD 32 million.

The project was declared open in December 2017, and it is noteworthy that the Epilepsy Hospital consists of 08 floors with a capacity of 242 beds within the National Hospital complex in Colombo.

The hospital also meets the increasing health needs and provides services for treating epilepsy and convulsions resulting from an increase in the brain’s electrical energy.
