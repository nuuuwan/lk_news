Patali says willing to run for Sri Lanka president if invited by new alliance

ECONOMYNEXT — If invited to contest Sri Lanka’s upcoming presidential election by a newly formed alliance, opposition MP Patali Champika Ranawaka will accept it, the MP said.

Speaking to reporters, Ranawaka said he is confident of his capacity to run the country.

“We will form an alliance to develop the country in the future. That alliance will decide who should contest the parliamentary elections, the presidential election,” the MP said.

“If I’m invited to accept the candidacy for the presidency, I will take it. I’m quite confident that I can build this country,” he said.

In February, Ranawaka presented a ‘common minimum progamme’ to President Ranil Wickremesinghe and representatives of the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), with a proposal to trim the executive powers of the president’s office to 2015 levels.

Titled “A Step Forward with Unity for Our Nation”, the 32-page document contains proposed short and long term solutions to Sri Lanka’s ongoing issues.

Among these was a proposal that reads “Revisiting and reducing the President’s executive powers to the levels observed in 2015, fostering a more balanced distribution of authority”.

Ranawaka, who is widely seen as harbouring ambitions of national leadership, recently left the SJB on whose ticket he contested and won the 2020 parliamentary election. Last year, he quit the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) the nationalist party of which he was a founding member and subsequently its leader, to form a new centre-right party named the United Republic Front (URF).
