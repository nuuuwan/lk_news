At least 116 out of 455 former Provincial Council Representatives from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and the United National Party (UNP) have expressed their support to President Ranil Wickremesinghe ahead of the upcoming Presidential election.

The group expressed their support to the President during a meeting between the President and former Provincial Council representatives from the two parties in Battaramulla yesterday.

The group also endorsed Former Chief Minister of the Western Province, Isuru Devapriya’s proposal yesterday that President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s victory in the upcoming Presidential election should be regarded as a significant achievement of the group.

Addressing the event, Wickremesinghe emphasised his commitment to advancing the country with a fresh vision and unbiased program. The President said he plans to delegate responsibilities to all ten governing bodies, including the nine Provincial Governments and the Central Government, to carry out his initiatives.

The President further emphasised the importance of protecting and advancing the country’s growing economy. He stressed that the agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) must remain intact, underscoring that it is everyone’s duty to continue striving for economic progress, even during election periods.

The President stressed the critical need to adhere to the IMF agreement to avoid plunging back into crisis. He highlighted that current funds are only available until December, necessitating a new agreement in January to secure continued financial support. The President also emphasised the importance of addressing youth unemployment, poverty, and national development.

To this end, he proposed establishing ten Governments: nine Provincial and one Central — each with specific responsibilities. Announcing his candidacy as an independent in the upcoming Presidential election, he called for a fresh perspective and unbiased program to move the country forward.

The President announced that Provincial Council elections will be held after the Parliamentary elections, with plans to conduct them under the 1988 system, a decision discussed and agreed upon with MP Sumanthiran. He mentioned that Members of Parliament can run for Provincial Council positions while retaining their current roles, emphasising the need for unified Government efforts.

Additionally, he proposed the creation of a Rajya Sabha, which would include the President, Prime Minister, Party leaders, and Chief Ministers. As of 2017, Chief Ministers from seven provinces are operating according to the Constitutional Council report, with support from Tamil parties. While the discussion on police powers will be deferred, the implementation of other activities will proceed immediately, the President added.
