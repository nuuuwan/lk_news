Special meeting today to discuss VIP security

A special discussion has been called today to discuss security measures for former presidents and other VIPs.

Accordingly, the discussion is scheduled to be held this afternoon (30) at the Ministry of Public Security, chaired by Minister Vijitha Herath.

Acting IGP Priyantha Weerasooriya and other officials are also expected to attend the meeting.

Recently, a decision was made to remove the security provided for VIPs, including former presidents.

However, the former presidents have subsequently informed about their security needs and the number of personnel they require.

Accordingly, today’s discussion aims to reach a final decision after thoroughly examining this issue.

Meanwhile, the Acting IGP has taken steps to assign officers from other duties to address the shortage of officers in the police department.
