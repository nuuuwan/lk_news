Sri Lanka hardline elements ready to exploit racial hatred: Former minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Families should be allowed to grieve and memorialize their loved ones, a former Minister of Justice has said, but Sri Lanka must be watchful of hardline elements in the South that are ready to exploit any opportunity to stoke racial hatred.

“Families should be allowed to grieve and memorialize their loved ones, even those whose paths were misled by the ideologies of the past,” Ali Sabry said on social platform X.

This is a human right and an essential step in healing wounds, Sabry pointed out.

“We must also remember that hardline elements in the South are ever-watchful, ready to exploit any opportunity to stoke racial hatred. Let us deny them that chance,” he said.

The former minister’s post follows social media posts criticizing the commemoration of Maaveerar Naal in the country’s north.

Sabry said that “glorifying the LTTE or its leader, a ruthless architect of terror, is not the way forward.”

“Such actions risk rekindling the pain of the past, igniting unnecessary tension, and undermining the process of reconciliation.”

Closure cannot be achieved by celebrating violence, he said, but must “come through reflection, understanding, and commitment to peace.”

The former minister urged citizens to work together “to build the Sri Lankan identity we long for — a nation where diversity is strength, not division, and where the mistakes of history serve as lessons, not fuel for further discord.”

“As we work toward a united and harmonious Sri Lanka, it is vital to respect the memories of all who suffered and perished during the tragic years of conflict.” (Colombo/Nov28/2024)
