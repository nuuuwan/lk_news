Sri Lanka Police awards Rs. 1 million compensation to family of lorry driver

Colombo, Jan 20 (Daily Mirror) - The Sri Lanka Police provided a compensation of Rs. 1 million to the family of a lorry driver who lost his life in the shooting incident in Narammala.

Acting Inspector General of Police Deshabandu Thennakoon personally handed over the compensation at the residence of the deceased driver in Alawwa.

The incident occurred on Thursday night when a 41-year-old lorry driver became the victim of an accidental discharge from a sub-inspector's firearm.

The Sub Inspector and a Constable had signalled the driver to stop, but he had allegedly defied the order. Accordingly, the 59-year-old Sub-Inspector and a Constable chased and halted the lorry for a spot inspection, resulting in the accidental discharge of the Sub-Inspector's firearm.

The critically injured driver was rushed to the Narammala Hospital, where he later succumbed to his injuries.

In the aftermath, both the Sub-Inspector and the Constable involved in the incident were arrested, with the Sub-Inspector remanded till January 23 by the Narammala Magistrate.

Meanwhile, the Police have suspended the duties of both officers pending further investigations.
