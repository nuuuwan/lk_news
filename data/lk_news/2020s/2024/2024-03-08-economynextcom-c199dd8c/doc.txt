Sri Lanka president invites party leaders to IMF review meeting

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s President Ranil Wickremesinghe has convened a meeting with leaders of ‘accepted’ political parties to discuss the proposals put forth by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) delegation.

Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa, leader of the National People’s Power (NPP) Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leader S Sridharan have been invited to participate in these deliberations, the president’s media division said in a statement.

The meeting will be held at the Presidential Secretariat on Monday (11), with an open invitation extended to interested individuals to join alongside the invited leaders.

The IMF second review commenced on Thursday at the Finance Ministry. Wickremesinghe met Peter Breuer, Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka who said that the IMF program is “exhibiting promising signs of efficacy, translating into tangible outcomes”.

The invitation stems from a request made by Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Harsha de Silva in Parliament this week.

Wickremesinghe has pointed out the necessity of collective accountability from all parties involved. (Colombo/Mar8/2024)
