Sri Lanka’s JAT binder plant looks to export excess product

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s JAT Holdings Plc, which produces wood coatings and brushes, said it had begun manufacturing its own binders at its new plant in Horana, and hopes to export product in the future.

“The new JAT Binder Plant will complement JAT’s Alkyd Resin Plant in Bangladesh, and its cross-border manufacturing infrastructure,” the company said in a stock exchange filing.

JAT said there was potential for exporting its excess production of binders, the foundational component of wood coatings and emulsion paint, from this plant and launching even more cost-efficient, quality products for customers.

The state-of-the-art plant began operations in March at a cost 1,521,256,438 rupees.
