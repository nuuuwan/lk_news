Sri Lanka private credit expands in first half, govt credit eases

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s private credit has expanded 146 billion rupees in the first half of 2024, official data shows, while credit to the government eased but continued to outpace private credit.

Commercial Bank credit to the government expanded 354 billion rupees in the six months to June 2024, compared to 1,043 billion rupees in a year earlier, which was partly driven by a 517 billion restructure of SOE debt.

Government and SOE debt expanded by 293 billion rupees in the first half of 2024, compared to 405 billion rupees last year.

Credit to state enterprises declined by 60 billion rupees in the first six months.

Private credit has expanded amid an appreciation of the rupee in 2024 and the growth has come from a real expansion of either working capital or investment credit with the central bank providing monetary stability.

In the 12 months to June private credit has expanded 432 billion rupees.

From June 2022 to May 2023, private credit contracted 733 billion rupees, as companies de-leveraged with demand plunging from a currency collapse and ending of inflationary policy.

Companies that emerge from de-leveraging have lower debt and are ‘leaner and meaner’ and can expand if conditions remain stable. (Colombo/July28/2024)
