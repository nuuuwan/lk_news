UNP calls on all parties to join hands

Colombo, April 16 (Daily Mirror)- Stressing that it is time to forget party politics, the United National Party (UNP) today invited all political parties to join hands to create a stable nation.

“What we are thinking of is a joint effort which goes beyond party politics. Therefore we invite all political parties to join hands to achieve the common goal of making Sri Lanka a stable nation,” UNP General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara said.

He said this in response to a question raised by journalists whether the UNP will welcome SLFP members to join hands, now that  the latter is facing a crisis.

“We don’t care who will join us as long as they are ready to join hands for the sake of the nation,” he added.

The UNP General Secretary made a specific invitation to all MPs in the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) who are at loggerheads with their party leader to join the UNP.

Accordingly he invited Harsha de Silva, Eran Wickramaratne, Kabir Hashim and Thalatha Athukorala to join the UNP.

“We are inviting these MPs as we see they are at loggerheads with the SJB leadership and are being sidelined,” he said.

Also he urged the SJB and the National People’s Power (NPP) to stop their current drama over debates.

“There is no use in debating on the economy as far as the SJB and the NPP are concerned as they both declined the offers to take over the government during the crisis,” Range Bandara said.

He said both parties should have had their debates in 2022 when the nation was facing the economic crisis.
