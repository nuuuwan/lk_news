Agripreneurs’ Forum ready to collaborate with new Govt. for economic revival and food security

The Sri Lanka Agripreneurs’ Forum (SLAF) last week congratulated the newly elected Government and Parliament, expressing optimism for a transformative era in Sri Lanka’s agricultural and economic landscape.

“SLAF firmly believes that the new Government, with its visionary leadership, has the potential to bring about the comprehensive changes needed to uplift the agriculture sector. This leadership offers a unique opportunity to address systemic challenges while fostering innovation, sustainability, and economic inclusivity, ensuring that all stakeholders benefit from a reinvigorated and modernised framework,” SLAF said in a statement. It also said the following: This juncture presents an extraordinary opportunity to strengthen the national framework for agribusinesses, fostering an inclusive climate that supports innovation, sustainability, and growth in the agriculture sector.

Representing over 20,000 agripreneurs and stakeholders, SLAF is dedicated to its mission of transitioning subsistence-level farmers, reliant on subsidies, into successful agripreneurs capable of contributing significantly to the national economy. By modernising agricultural practices, streamlining value chains, and encouraging entrepreneurial spirit, the Forum envisions a future where Sri Lanka’s agricultural sector thrives as a driver of sustainable development and food security.

The Forum emphasises the need for policy consistency and a collaborative approach to address longstanding challenges in the agricultural value chain. Enhancing access to modern technologies, expanding financial opportunities for agripreneurs, and improving rural infrastructure are critical to this transformation. Additionally, promoting skill development and facilitating market access will empower farmers to move beyond traditional subsistence farming into profitable and innovative ventures that benefit both the local and international markets.

SLAF believes that the new Government holds the potential to implement impactful reforms that align with the broader goal of national progress. By creating a cohesive and inclusive environment, the Government can enable agripreneurs to adopt advanced practices, contribute to economic resilience, and ensure long-term sustainability.

The Sri Lanka Agripreneurs’ Forum remains committed to partnering with the Government in shaping a vibrant, future-ready agriculture sector. Together, we can transform agriculture into a cornerstone of Sri Lanka’s economic growth, empowering communities and fostering shared prosperity for generations to come.
