Railway Station Masters warn of indefinite strike

Executive grade officers of the university’s non-academic staff have decided to report to work from today (15), after ending the strike action.

This decision follows a discussion with Prof. Sampath Amaratunge, Chairman of the University Grants Commission, regarding their demands.

Meanwhile, the Railway Station Masters’ Union warns of a indefinite strike if the Minister of Transport fails to submit their demands for Cabinet approval and provide solutions today (15).

President of the union Sumedha Somaratne stated that they will meet tomorrow (16) to make a final decision.
