Cabinet clears six-acre land to construct monastery in Nuwara Eliya with Indian aid

The Cabinet of Ministers cleared the allocation of land to the Sri Narayana Dharma Sangam Colombo Trust on a 30-year long-term lease basis to construct a monastery in the Nuwara Eliya district with Indian assistance.

The construction of the monastery is in commemoration of the centennial of Sri Narayan Guru.

“The Sri Narayana Dharma Sangam Colombo Trust had submitted a request for the allotment of land from the Nuwara Eliya district to build the monastery. A land measuring six acres and two roods, known as ‘Rambodawatta’ and belonging to the Land Reform Commission in the Kothmale Divisional Secretariat of the Nuwara Eliya District is identified for this purpose,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

He said the monastery is poised to become a beacon of spiritual enlightenment and cultural enrichment in the Nuwara Eliya district, further strengthening ties between Sri Lanka and India in the realm of cultural exchange and cooperation.

“It will further boost tourist attraction and inflow of travellers to Nuwara Eliya,” he added. The proposal put forth by the Lands Minister Harin Fernando was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers at its meeting on Monday.
