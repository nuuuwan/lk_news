Foreign assignments galore…

The group LunuDehi is on a roll where foreign assignments are concerned.

They were in Dubai last month and were seen in action at ‘PIMA NIGHT 2024,’ a gala dinner dance held at the Millennium Plaza Downtown Hotel.

Their next overseas tour is to the UK, Canada, and the USA as backing band for BNS, Umaria and Randhir.

Canada – Calgary (March 8 – sold out), Vancouver (March 9 – sold out), Ottawa (March 15 – sold out), Toronto (March 16).

USA – Tampa (March 22), New York (March 23), Houston ((March 30), San Francisco (April 5) and Los Angele (April 6).

LunuDehi has emerged as a very popular outfit in the scene here as they are dynamic on stage and the music they produce is very infectious.

No doubt they would be having many more foreign assignments coming up…for the year 2024.
