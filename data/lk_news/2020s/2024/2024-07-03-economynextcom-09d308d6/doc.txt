SriLankan Airlines bidders being further evaluated: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet of ministers have not yet approved a set of prequalified bidders for state-run SriLankan Airlines, Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.

Six parties responded to an initial expression of interest called by Sri Lanka’s State Owned Enterprises Restructuring Unit to divest the airline.

The bids are being “further evaluated,” he told reporters in Colombo Wednesday.

Sri Lanka “would like to see a Sri Lankan entrepreneur or consortium” buying into the airline but there was no firm interest, he said.

The parties should have a strong balance sheet and expertise, as there were the jobs of 6,000 people at stake, he said. (Colombo/July03/2024)
