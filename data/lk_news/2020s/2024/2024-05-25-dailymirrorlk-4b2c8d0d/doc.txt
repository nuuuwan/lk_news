Several train services cancelled due to trees, rocks obstructing tracks

Colombo, May 25 (Daily Mirror) The Sri Lanka Railways Department announced today (25) that the night mail trains between Badulla and Colombo and other special trains on the up-country line have been cancelled due to trees and rocks obstructing the tracks.

They reported over 15 incidents of trees falling onto the tracks so far.

Additionally, power interruptions have caused significant issues with the railway signal system, particularly beyond Nanu Oya station.

The Department urged motorists to exercise caution at railway crossings, as signal failures are possible due to power breakdowns. Drivers are advised to be vigilant if there is no signal or if the electric bells continue to ring with only a red signal at the crossings.
