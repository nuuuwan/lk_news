Southern Gujarat Chamber proposes Sri Lanka prioritise wedding tourism

ECONOMYNEXT – A group of businesspersons from the Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) visiting the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce to strengthen trade and investment ties between India and Sri Lanka, have suggested the island nation prioritise wedding tourism to tap into the growing Indian market for destination weddings.

SGCCI proposed that Sri Lanka “prioritise Wedding Tourism to tap into the growing Indian market for destination weddings,” the Ceylon Chamber said in a statement.

“Highlighting Sri Lanka’s pristine beaches, luxury resorts, and cultural appeal, the delegates suggested tailored wedding packages and targeted marketing campaigns in India to position the island as a premier destination.”

SGCCI “expressed strong interest in forming joint ventures and collaborations with Sri Lankan companies, emphasising mutual benefits such as technological exchanges, shared expertise, and enhanced market access.

Other key areas identified for collaboration included leveraging Southern Gujarat’s advanced textile manufacturing capabilities, establishing partnerships in gem processing and trading and expanding the export of Sri Lankan agro-products to Gujarat.

The delegation’s visit follows an MOU signed between the two Chambers earlier this year, which paved the path for close collaboration on trade, investment, and industry-specific initiatives, unlocking new opportunities for businesses in both regions. (Colombo/Nov29/2024)
