Sri Lanka EC warns of legal action against candidates not compiling expense report

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Election Commission (EC) has warned all candidates who have failed to submit their election campaign income and expenditure after contested in the November 14 parliament polls.

The Election Commission has set a deadline to submit the income and expenditure reports for 12 midnight on Friday, December 06, 2024.

R M A L Ratnayake, the Chairman of the EC said only few have submitted their reports so far.

“It is not only for those who have elected to the parliament, but those all who contested the election. They all should file their expenditure reports, Ratnayake told in a video clip circulated by the EC.

“I specially urge all candidates to fulfil this obligation without facing any legal actions.”

“In the event of a legal action, those candidates who face legal action are sometimes likely to lose their opportunity of contesting in local government or provincial council polls.”

Out of the total 8,361 candidates, around 24 percent or 1,985 have submitted their reports to the Election Commission as at 3 pm on Tuesday (03), the Commission said in a statement.

Out of a total 690 political parties and independent groups, only 15.4 percent (106) and out of 527 named national list members, only 10.8 percent (57) have so far submitted their reports, the EC said.
