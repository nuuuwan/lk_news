Special toll-free railway service for Poson week

Sri Lanka Railways has decided to implement a special railway service offering toll-free rides for a week starting from today (17) for passengers heading to Mihintale from Anuradhapura for Poson Poya Day.

Moreover, necessary steps have been taken to implement a special bus service from Maho railway station to Anuradhapura for the railway passengers who come from Colombo to Maho.

Due to the ongoing renovation activities along the Northern Railway track between Maho and Anuradhapura railway stations, no trains will be running from Maho to Anuradhapura during this period. Therefore, to accommodate pilgrimsâ€™ convenience, it has been decided to allocate around 400 additional buses to facilitate this.

In addition, Minister of Highways, Transport, and Mass Media, Bandula Gunawardena inaugurated the renovated railway line in between Mihintale and Anuradhapura today (17).

This year, the Poson Full Moon Poya Day falls on June 21 while the National Poson Week will commence tomorrow (18), with numerous religious ceremonies planned at Atamasthana in Auradhapura.

Meanwhile, Anuradhapura District Secretary Janaka Jayasundara said it is expected that a large number of devotees will arrive in Anuradhapura and Mihintale for Poson celebrations this year.
