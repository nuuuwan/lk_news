Fonseka Calls New SJB Member “Shameless”

COLOMBO (News 1st); Samagi Jana Balavegaya Chairman Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka  launched a scathing attack on former Army Commander Daya Rathnayake, who joined the SJB earlier this week.

"The Samagi Jana Balawegaya was built on sacrifice, not to be tarnished by the decisions of a few," declared Fonseka in a fiery address.

He expressed strong reservations about Rathnayake's past and suitability for the party, calling him "shameless" and questioning his motives.

Fonseka revealed his disapproval of the decision at the highest levels, stating that he had "strongly criticized" the move to both the party leader and the general secretary.

Fonseka likened Rathnayake's inclusion to a slippery slope, fearing it could pave the way for accepting other controversial figures like former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa or ex-Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal.

He emphasized the importance of adhering to principles and selecting members with "untainted pasts and good reputations."
