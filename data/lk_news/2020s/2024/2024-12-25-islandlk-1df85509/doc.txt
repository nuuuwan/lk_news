Melwa supporting the development of motorcycle racing industry in Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka’s leading steel manufacturer, MELWA showcased the outstanding achievements of its riders, Kushan Chamod and Janith Chameera, at two major racing events. At the Katukuruda Races organized by the Sri Lanka Association of Racing Drivers and Riders (SLARDAR), Chamod displayed his dominance on the track by securing first place in the 600 cubic capacity (cc) event and an impressive second place in the 1000cc event. Janith Chameera also made waves, clinching first place in the Tracker event, cementing MELWA’S association with racing excellence.

The spotlight continued to shine on the MELWA TEAM at the Sri Lanka Autosport Drivers’ Association (SLADA) Rotherham-Katukurunda Tarmac Race. In the thrilling 1000cc Grand Prix event spanning 22 laps, Kushan Chamod rode his Honda CBR1000 to a sensational first-place finish. Meanwhile, Chameera, riding a Honda CBR600, secured a commendable fourth place, showcasing determination and skill against tough competition.

The company took steps to supply high-speed motorcycles to Chameera and Kushan Chamod – two motorcycle rides born in Negombo. They have offered these with the aim of popularizing motorcycle racing among Sri Lankan youth and creating young and talented rides from Sri Lanka who can reach greater heights at international level.
