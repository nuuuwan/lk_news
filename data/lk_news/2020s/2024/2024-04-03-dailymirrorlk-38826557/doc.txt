Only one container intended for unloading at Colombo port: Minister

Colombo, April 3 (Daily Mirror) - Only one container out of the 56 containers listed as dangerous cargo on board the ‘Dali’ cargo vessel that collided with the Baltimore Bridge in US recently, intended for unloading at the Colombo port, Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said today.

The minister said this in response to ongoing speculation, noting that the vessel's Sri Lankan agent had formally communicated this detail to the relevant authorities.

Minister de Silva emphasized that out of the 56 containers listed as dangerous cargo, destined for re-export to another country, the Colombo Port was not the final stop for the vessel. |The ultimate destination for the ship is China, yet there have been mistaken reports indicating otherwise,” he said.

Concerns regarding the undisclosed contents of the container set for unloading in Colombo, the minister said that in accordance with international maritime regulations, detailed shipment declarations are typically made two days prior to reaching the port. Moreover, strict customs inspections precede any unloading activity, ensuring transparency and safety protocols are firmly in place.

Minister de Silva clarified that vessels like the ‘Dali’ carry both general and dangerous cargo, and rejecting ships solely based on the presence of dangerous cargo is not a viable solution. The adherence to established procedures and thorough customs checks guarantee the proper handling of all goods on board before any further actions are taken.
