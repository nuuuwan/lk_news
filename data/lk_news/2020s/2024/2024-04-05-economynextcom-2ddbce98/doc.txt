Sri Lanka plans state ayurvedic massage centres for tourists

ECONOMYNEXT – Ayurvedic medicine should be integrated into the tourism industry more effectively, State Minister of Indigenous Medicine Sisira Jayakody has said.

“Tourists show a particular fascination and enthusiasm for massage techniques offered by the traditional medical system,” Jayakody told reporters on Thursday.

“In collaboration with the Department of Ayurveda, we are establishing ‘Body Mantra’ massage centres across the country.”

The centres are planned for hotels and resorts within the country, as well as abroad, “aiming to deliver expert services with certified professionalism. NVQ 4 qualified therapists would be recruited to work in them.”

The Ayurvedic Code, recently approved by parliament, has regulations to oversee Ayurvedic products and centres in the country, the state minister said.

“This legislation grants legal authority to regulate beauty salons, indigenous medicine transportation, and similar areas. With the current market for plant extract production surpassing USD 26 billion, we expect to earn around 3 billion dollars through Ayurvedic product exports.”

At present, spas set up throughout the country are not affiliated with the Ministry of Indigenous Medicine or the Department of Ayurveda, he said.

“The Department of Ayurveda does not grant licenses for ‘spas’. Our formal regulatory oversight is focused on registered massage parlours under the purview of the Department of Ayurveda.” (Colombo/Apr5/2024)
