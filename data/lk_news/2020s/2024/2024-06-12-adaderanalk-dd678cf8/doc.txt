NPP backs continuation of Provincial Councils in existing form

Leader of the National People’s Power (NPP) Anura Kumara Dissanayake affirmed his party’s support for the continuation of Provincial Councils in their current form.

Speaking to the media following a discussion in Jaffna with representatives from the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the NPP leader stressed the need for further dialogue to enhance the role and effectiveness of Provincial Councils.

“In order to move forward from here, we need to build a discussion, especially on constitutional changes,” Dissanayake said.

The NPP Leader further added: “Provincial councils represent a devolution of power. While we support the existing Provincial Councils, we recognize that they have not resolved the current issues. Therefore, we need to go beyond the existing framework.”

“We believe that national unity can be established through changes in many sections such as constitutional, legal and practical.”
