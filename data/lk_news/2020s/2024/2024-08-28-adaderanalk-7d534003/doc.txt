Namal criticizes unjust taxes, pledges economic revival

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) presidential candidate Namal Rajapaksa affirmed his commitment to developing the nation’s economy while ensuring the welfare of the general public is not overlooked.

Addressing a constituency meeting held in Mawathagama, Rajapaksa emphasized the SLPP’s consistent track record of making decisions in the ‘best interest’ of the country. “We have never taken a political decision that is harmful to the country. I think the responsibility and challenge that I have is how to take the country forward from where President Mahinda Rajapaksa stopped the development of this country.”

He also expressed concern over the struggles faced by small and medium enterprises (SMEs), citing the current government’s tax policies. “It is very difficult for small and medium businesses today. The present government is implementing an unlimited unfair tax policy,” he said, adding that “the SLPP government under Gotabaya’s tenure, we implemented a tax policy that is affordable for the people of this country,” he added.

Rajapaksa also assured that the SLPP is prepared to take on the responsibility of rebuilding the economy.
