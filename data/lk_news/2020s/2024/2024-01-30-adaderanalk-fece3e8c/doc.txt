Students surround administrative building of Kelaniya Uni

A group of around 350 students have reportedly surrounded the administrative building of the Kelaniya University.

The students had also held a protest blocking the Colombo-Kandy road last night (29) while police had resorted to using tear gas and water cannons in an attempt to disperse them.

The anti-government demonstration also disrupted the vehicular movement along the Colombo - Kandy main road.

It had been launched over several demands including a hike in ‘Mahapola’ scholarship payments.
