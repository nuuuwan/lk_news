Black Soldier flies; potential source of animal protein

A study reveals that local Black Soldier flies could help meet the protein requirement in animal feed. In other words, millions of rupees could be saved annually, Sri Lankan experts in the field said.

The research conducted by a group of senior local academics reveals the shortcomings encountered in meeting the protein requirements for animal feed, especially in the area of dairy farming. It was revealed that a high amount of protein could be obtained by using the chitin of the BSF, or the Black Soldier fly species.

The research team was headed by Professor Nilantha Liyanage of the University of Ruhuna and Professor A.W. Wijerathna of the University of Sabaragamuwa.

The Island Financial Review learns that to fulfill the protein requirement in the preparation of animal feed here, the research carried out on the cultivation of larvae of the Black Soldier fly, a species of fly that lives around garbage dumps in our country, has been successful thus far.

Experts pointed out that BSF can convert a wide range of organic substrates (from food waste to manure) into a high-quality nutrient source for animals and aquaculture feed, thereby reducing waste in landfills.

They said the highest cost in animal feed production is incurred in meeting the protein requirement. A discussion was recently held at the Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries regarding the cultivation of the Black Soldier fly.

Several senior university academics who are currently conducting research related to this project participated in this discussion which was chaired by Agriculture and Plantation Industries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera and Minister State for Livestock Development D.B. Herath.

For the cultivation of this species of BSF flies, the food used for them is waste food as well as vegetables and fruits that are discarded at markets. The researchers said that a pulp prepared using such material as a medium could also throw-up solutions to the garbage problem.

The minister stated that the Ministry of Agriculture is ready to provide all the support for the success of this program and assigned the responsibility of carrying out the project to the Livestock Division.
