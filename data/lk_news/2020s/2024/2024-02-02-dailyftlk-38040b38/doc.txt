SJB denies defection: Daya Ratnayake not joining MJP

Condemns spread of false information using old photographs of duo

Warns recurrence of such groundless false news will be commonplace going forward due to upcoming polls

MJP also refutes reports and says they are an attempt to tarnish party’s good name

Maintains images were from a previous meeting between duo who are close friends

In a statement issued yesterday, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) denied that its latest member, former Army Commander Daya Ratnayake has defected to the Mawbima Janatha Party (MJP) led by business tycoon Dilith Jayaweera.

The party was forced to issue a clarification after images depicting Ratnayake in a seemingly one-on-one discussion with Jayaweera surfaced online yesterday. The images were accompanied by reports suggesting that the two had met yesterday at the MJP office in Borella, leading to speculation that Ratnayake had left the SJB to join the MJP.

The SJB strongly condemned the spread of false information and particularly the use of old photographs to support the unfounded claims.

The party’s announcement emphasised that the formation of the most extensive alliance for the upcoming elections is currently underway, with the SJB at its core and therefore, the recurrence of such groundless false news will be commonplace going forward.

Meanwhile, a spokesman for the MJP also refuted the news reports and said it was an attempt to tarnish the reputation of the party.

The spokesperson claimed that Jayaweera and Ratnayake maintain a close friendship and there is a concerted effort by a specific group to manufacture news about a meeting between the two using photos from a previous encounter. However, the MJP spokesperson clarified that there was no recent discussion between the duo.

Furthermore, he alleged that these false reports were part of a calculated strategy to erode the increasing public support for Jayaweera and the MJP.
