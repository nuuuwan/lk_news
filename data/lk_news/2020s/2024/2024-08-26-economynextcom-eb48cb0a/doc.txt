Sri Lanka to miss excise revenue target as high prices reduces legal arrack sales

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is likely to miss the 2024 target on the excise tax as production has reduced compared to the last year with the liquor prices having risen amid increase in illicit liquor manufacturing, a top Excise Department official said.

Sri Lanka government has set a target of 232 billion rupees for 2024; a 29.6 percent jump compared to last year’s 179 billion rupees.

The Excise Department has already collected 132.7 billion rupees in taxes up to August 22, compared to 106.5 billion rupees in the same period last year.

However, the Excise Department believes it can reach only 215 billion rupees in the full year.

M.J. Gunasiri, Commissioner General of Excise said the liquor production fell 22 percent to 35 million liters last year compared to 45 million in 2022.

“According to the trend, this year it will be around 31-32 million liters. There is a 30 percent increase in illicit liquor as the prices of liquor have risen in the last two years,” Gunasiri told reporters at a media briefing in Colombo.

“There is around 3 million liters of excess ethanol. It is obvious that there is a production drop. We might reach 215 billion rupees. We are trying our best to get it to 220 billion.”

However, he said there is a significant increase in the excise revenue compared to the last year. (Colombo/August 26/2024)
