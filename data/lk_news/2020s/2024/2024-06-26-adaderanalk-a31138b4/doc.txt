President urges all MPs to help pass agreements reached with creditor nations

Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe says that today marks an important day in the country’s recent history and a unique turning point.

Delivering a special address to the nation on Wednesday (26), the Head of State said that the country is benefitting from the positive results of the hard work carried out by the government in the recent past.

He said that this morning, Sri Lanka reached a final restructuring agreement for USD 5.8 billion of debt with its bilateral lenders’ Official Creditor Committee in Paris, France.

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka today also signed debt treatment agreements with the Export-Import Bank of China (EXIM) in Beijing to restructure USD 4.2 billion of debt.

He stated that the necessary formal procedures are currently being implemented.

“For those who truly love the country, this is a ‘good news’. Sri Lanka won,” he declared in the televised speech.

Wickremesinghe states that as Sri Lanka has reached agreements with the bilateral creditors, the international trust in the country will be increased.

“This is an international assurance in a certain way”, Wickremesinghe expressed.

“The international communities, who didn’t even accept the letters of credit from us, are now at a situation which gives us a certification of trust”, he added.

Commenting further, the Head of the State highlighted that both the agreements reached today will be tabled in the Parliament by Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena during the special parliamentary session to be convened on July 02.

“I urge all the members representing the Parliament, who are patriotic to the country to help pass these agreements in Parliament”, said the President.

Meanwhile, Wickremesinghe emphasized that the country cannot find solutions to the economic issues through strikes or threats, but by joining hands for strengthening the economy.
