Janaka Ratnayake criticises political rallies as ‘business ventures’

Eksath Lanka Podujana Peramuna Presidential candidate Janaka Ratnayake yesterday expressed concerns over the state of politics in Sri Lanka, claiming that the political landscape has transformed into a business enterprise over the past 76 years, causing significant hardship for the people. Speaking at a media briefing, Ratnayake alleged that candidates routinely organise large election rallies with the help of companies that specialise in assembling crowds.

He further claimed that individuals attending these rallies are paid between Rs. 3,000 and Rs. 5,000, creating an artificial image of public support.

“These gatherings, featured on social and State media, are not representative of genuine political movements,” Ratnayake said.

He claimed that most people are still undecided on whom to vote for. “Our people have become disillusioned with politics,” he said.

Ratnayake pointed out that the excitement surrounding political rallies exists primarily on social media, creating a media spectacle rather than reflecting real political engagement among the populace.
