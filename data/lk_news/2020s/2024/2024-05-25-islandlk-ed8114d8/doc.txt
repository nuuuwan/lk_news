Trump posts fake news about “the creation of a ‘Unified Reich’

A second Supreme Court judge defies the Constitution, flies flags of Fascism

Last Monday, Trump posted a 30-second video on his Truth Social network which had a vision of himself speaking at a campaign rally, with a fake newspaper in the background, flaunting eye-catching 60-point-font bold headlines to grab the reader’s attention:

This header was followed by the summary of a series of articles, stolen from Nazi propaganda, praising German industrial strength and production which had significantly improved after 1871, with the creation by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, of the Erstes Reich, (First Reich). A unified German empire, which brought about German prosperity made possible by the closing of its borders and the deportation of 15 million illegal aliens and Jews, vermin who were poisoning the blood of Germany. Policies perfectly emulated by Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich in the 1930s.

Trump argued that the video echoed his policies after his resumption of the presidency in 2025, which will bring about peace and prosperity to America. The video was removed after two hours, probably on advice of an oxymoron extension of “moderate Nazis”.

President Biden, commenting on the video, said “A Unified Reich? That’s not the language of an American president, that’s not the language of any American. It’s the language of Hitler’s Germany”. As White House Press Secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre said, “it is abhorrent, sickening and disgraceful to promote contents associated with Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler”.

And it’s not as if Trump’s use of this fascist language has been a rare occurrence. His admiration of ruthless dictators like Putin and Xi Jinping pathetically resonates his manic, narcissistic greed for power. The video echoes Trump’s rhetoric on how he is going to rule the country if he wins a second term. And some Americans will vote for him, though they are completely aware, even approve, of this likely Hitlerian prognosis.

I have long been trying to figure out how 74 million Americans voted for Trump in 2020 after his dismal first term, which brought America to its moral, medical and economic knees, and ruined the reputation of a nation which, under President Obama, hitherto had the admiration of the world. And how on earth he is currently leading in the polls, after conviction of sexual assault and financial fraud, in debt for court-imposed damages of $500 million, and currently awaiting the verdict of a criminal trial for election fraud and making illegal hush-money payments to a porn star.

This is not to forget three far more serious criminal indictments he has been arrested on 91 felonies, on charges of obstruction of justice, sedition and espionage. Trials which he has, by means of a ridiculously dilatory judicial system and the most corrupt Supreme Court in the nation’s history, manipulated to delay until after the November election. Charges which, if he wins re-election, will be dismissed – by him, as the first dictator of the USA.

Apart from the corruption and pro-Trump bias already shown by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and his wife, Ginny, the New York Times has recently revealed instances of such bias displayed by another Justice, Samuel Alito.

Thomas accepted bribes of luxury vacations and the gift of a home for his mother from a Republican billionaire donor, while his wife took an active part in inciting the insurrection of January 6, 2021, pleading with then Trump Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, to do his utmost to ensure the illegal nullification of the November 2020 election, which Trump lost to President Biden by over 70 Electoral College votes and seven million popular votes.

A recent New York Times article states that the US flag was flown upside down, a symbol of Trump MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, outside the Virginia home of Justice Alito, for weeks after the January 6, 2021 insurrection. Another provocative “Appeal to Heaven” flag, a MAGA symbol calling for a Christian Jihad, a holy war for the establishment of a Christian government in the USA, completely at odds with the US constitution’s principle of the separation of church and state, was also aloft at Alito’s beach house in New Jersey. No explanation has been given by Justice Alito for actions which clearly display his political and religious biases.

US Supreme Court Justices are supposed not only to be above reproach, but like Caesar’s wife, give the appearance of being above reproach. Unlike every other court in the nation, the Supreme Court does not have an established Code of Ethics. The Justices of the Supreme Court are supposed to self-police their own ethical behavior.

Senior Democratic Senator from Illinois, Dick Durbin (Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee), does not agree. He states, “The court should have a Code of Conduct with clear and enforceable rules so both Justices and the American people know when conduct crosses the line. The highest court of the land should not have the lowest ethical standards”.

Justices Thomas and Alito have confirmed the wisdom of Senator Durbin’s contention by breaking not only the fundamental codes of ethics with impunity, but even the law of the land. They have already proved their biases in the Trump’s immunity case, where they have submitted their opinions that the former president is immune from prosecution even had he ordered the military assassination of a political rival. A preposterous opinion essentially disparate from the Rule of Law, and the internationally accepted concept that no one, not even the President of the United States, is above the law. The final Supreme Court verdict on this immunity case is scheduled to be delivered in June, and the opinions of Thomas and Alito are expected to be in the minority.

The venal corruption and political biases of these two Justices have reduced public approval of the present Supreme Court to its lowest levels in the nation’s history. An anomaly, with a 6/3 Conservative, Christian majority, which will continue for decades, considering the ages of many of the current Justices.

What is Trump’s secret? He does not have the charisma and the oratorical gift of a Kennedy, the humility and compassion of a Carter, the charm of a Clinton or the integrity and brilliance of an Obama. On the contrary, he is the most vulgar, vainglorious, ignorant power-hungry president in history, and as the former Republican Lieutenant Governor of Georgia, Geoff Duncan said at a recent interview, “Trump has the moral compass of an axe murderer”.

So perhaps the polls are completely lopsided, considering the fact that Trump has not won a single national election since 2016. He won that election by illegal means, according to the ongoing hush-money trial of breaches of campaign finance law in 2016, of which he is patently guilty. A verdict on this trial will be delivered after closing arguments next week, which is certain to result in a conviction or a hung jury, with minimal chance of an acquittal, based on opinions of legal scholars after due consideration of the evidence provided at the trial.

The tragedy is that whatever the verdict – acquittal, mistrial or conviction – will be Trumpeted as a victory, and Trump will be able to raise funds from his base, either as a martyr if convicted, or as the innocent victim of a witch-hunt in the event of a mistrial or an acquittal. His poll numbers will likely rise, whatever happens.

As an extension to the continuing Republican strategy of election denial, Trump, his Vice-Presidential aspirants like Speaker Mike Johnson, Senators Marco Rubio, Tim Scott and Ted Cruz, Representative Byron Donalds, and other leading Republicans refused, at recent public interviews, to answer a simple yes/no question: Would they accept the results of the 2024 presidential election? They all prevaricated, with various equivocal answers.

So win or lose, Trump has already had a major success. He has undermined public confidence in free and fair elections, the cornerstone of a vibrant democracy. And the end game of this strategy of election doubt/denial is violence.

My personal theory is that Trump’s fascist policies represent the death throes of a large minority of Americans of white, European heritage, who have collectively and exclusively “inherited” and enjoyed the enormous wealth of a nation incredibly awash with natural resources. Who have exploited the labor and talents of those black and multi-colored immigrants, some coerced into slavery, others seeking a better life, the “American Dream”, for over four centuries. These slaves and immigrants, with their free and cheap labor, with their diverse talents, created the greatest, wealthiest economic and military powerhouse in the world’s history.

An impure and alien dark-skinned population, they are necessary no longer. Indeed, they are now a burden, they represent a threat to the white supremacist, Christian way of life, and interfere in their continuing and exclusive enjoyment of the vast wealth of the richest country in the world.

I was led to compare the behavior of some these white Americans to that of Lemmings, who are supposed to commit mass suicide periodically by jumping off seaside cliffs. I have since learnt that this is a myth, that Lemmings do not commit suicide. So why is this myth of mass Lemming suicide still widely believed and used as a metaphor for human behavior, when someone who blindly follows a crowd – even towards catastrophe – is still called a Lemming?

The most logical reason for the persistence of this fraudulent myth is the wide coverage of the 1958 Disney movie, White Wilderness,  which filmed a death plunge of dozens of these creatures off a cliff. These images served to dramatize the cruelty of nature when Lemmings – and human beings – are forced by circumstances to destroy themselves when faced with situations and conditions considered, by themselves, untenable and impossible under which to exist.

For Lemmings, the untenable situation was supposed to be overpopulation. For white-supremacist Americans, such untenable conditions arose when the way of life and privileges they have enjoyed for centuries are being threatened. As they will be, when they are outnumbered by those colored immigrants of impure blood by 2050.

Democracy is not working for these white American Lemmings. They would rather destroy themselves with Trump’s totalitarian policies, even his extreme, Nazi style Final Solution, with the aforementioned creation of a Unified White Reich, than live in a nation defiled, in their perverted minds, by Diversity, Equality and Inclusion. Policies that will surely destroy them, just as Hitler’s policies destroyed that madman and the Nazis.

I am confident that the majority of Americans will not be stupidly suicidal enough to force all Americans down that mythical cliff leading to the dreaded White Wilderness in November.
