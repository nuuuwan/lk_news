It is noteworthy that the Asian Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank have extended further financial support to the government due to its commendable track record in debt repayment. During this period, negotiations are underway with relevant states and institutions to finalize agreements regarding the repayment of bilateral loans and interest, which currently stand at US$ 571.0 million.

Additionally, preliminary agreements have been reached concerning debt and interest payments, involving members of the Paris Club, with outstanding interest to be settled by the end of February 2024 amounting to $450.7 million.

Tennakoon said that it is worth noting that several countries, including Japan, have provisionally agreed to resume numerous projects halted in the past

These loans and interest payments have been denominated in US Dollars, Euros, Japanese Yen, and Canadian Dollars. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has bolstered its dollar reserves in foreign currencies to facilitate local payments to institutions like People’s Bank, Bank of Ceylon, and Hatton National Bank after settling local debt and interest obligations.

Furthermore, following the repayment of multilateral, bilateral, and local dollar loans, the country’s cash reserves have surged to over $4.9 billion ($4950 million).
