CTTA celebrates 130 years with “Honouring Legends” of industry

The Colombo Tea Traders’ Association (CTTA) continued its 130th anniversary celebrations with a grand event titled ‘Honouring Legends.’

The occasion, held at the Colombo Rowing Club on Saturday, 30 November, brought together a distinguished gathering of the industry’s most senior and esteemed members representing all stakeholders, namely, Producers, Manufacturers, Exporters, and Brokers of tea.

This landmark event recognised extraordinary individuals who have dedicated decades of service to the tea industry, shaping the legacy of ‘Ceylon Tea.’ The celebration reflected not only the rich heritage of the CTTA but also its commitment to honouring those whose contributions have sculpted the Ceylon tea industry into a global benchmark of excellence.

Addressing the audience, CTTA Chairman Sanjaya Herath praised the dedication and resilience of the senior members, stating: “This evening is about celebrating the pillars of our industry. Their unwavering passion and vision have propelled Ceylon tea to the forefront of the global stage.”

He further stated: “I would be remiss in my duties if I did not express our heartfelt gratitude for the ultimate sacrifice made by 14 courageous colleagues in the plantation industry, who gave their lives defending the integrity of our industry during the years 1987-1990. We also honour the memory of those who are no longer with us but dedicated their efforts to advancing the industry’s interests, particularly the late Michael de Zoysa, a former CTTA Chairman and the longest-serving Chairman in the Association’s history.”

The ceremony featured an array of heartfelt tributes and nostalgic speeches reflecting on cherished moments and the industry’s golden days. Many shared personal anecdotes and insights, recounting the evolution of the trade over the decades and the challenges overcome along the way.

A highlight was the presentation of personalised copies of ‘Tea Men,’ a publication that beautifully captures memories from the past. The event offered a wonderful opportunity for camaraderie and networking, bringing together attendees who reunited with colleagues after many years. It undoubtedly revived cherished memories of legendary individuals who, through their selfless contributions, helped model this remarkable industry into what it is today.

This celebration was part of a series of events planned by the CTTA throughout the year to commemorate its 130th anniversary. The Association remains steadfast in its mission to uphold the legacy of Ceylon tea while navigating the challenges of the modern world.

‘Honouring Legends’ was not just a tribute to the past but a reaffirmation of the industry’s collective commitment to a thriving future.
