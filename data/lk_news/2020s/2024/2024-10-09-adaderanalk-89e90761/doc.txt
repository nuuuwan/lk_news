Sri Lanka to seek BRICS membership at upcoming summit in Russia

Sri Lanka will pursue BRICS membership at a meeting in Russia later this month, cabinet spokesman Vijitha Herath told media on Tuesday.

Herath said that Russia will host the BRICS Summit in Kazan from Oct. 22 to Oct. 24, 2024.

Although President Anura Kumara Dissanayake was invited to attend the summit, he will be unable to participate due to domestic commitments, Herath explained.

The countryâ€™s secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, along with a team of officials, will represent Sri Lanka at the summit, where the country will formally seek BRICS membership, Herath said.

Sri Lanka plans to reach out to the foreign ministers of all BRICS nations for support soon, Herath said.
