Kamindu among ICC contenders for March Player of the Month awards

Apr. 4 (ICC) - The International Cricket Council (ICC) today revealed the shortlist of candidates in contention to scoop the ICC Men’s and Women’s Player of the Month awards for performances in March.

The ICC Player of the Month awards highlight the outstanding individual performers on the international cricket stage, and the names shortlisted for March spans a range of formats.

The ICC Men’s Player of the Month shortlist includes a key architect in Ireland’s first ever men’s Test victory, a prolific frontline bowler from New Zealand, and a record-breaking Sri Lankan Test run-scorer.

Mark Adair has his maiden nomination for the ICC Men’s Player of the Month award after spearheading Ireland’s Test win over Afghanistan as well as contributing in the shorter formats. New Zealand’s Matt Henry enjoyed a successful month with the ball also, taking regular wickets in his side’s World Test Championship series against Australia. The lineup is completed by Sri Lanka batter Kamindu Mendis, nominated for his memorable batting feats as Sri Lanka overcame Bangladesh in the longest format.

The women’s shortlist celebrates both shorter formats, with the nominees consisting of an explosive young English batter, and iconic all-rounders from Australia and New Zealand.

England’s Maia Bouchier blasted her way to the top of the run-scoring charts in her side’s victorious T20I series away in New Zealand, for which she is handed her maiden nomination. Ashleigh Gardner is a four-time former winner of the ICC Women’s Player of the Month and features once more after starring in Australia’s ODI series win against Bangladesh. New Zealand’s Amelia Kerr may have been on the losing end of the England series, yet she provided strong resistance as the White Ferns’ leading run-scorer and wicket-taker in March’s contests.

An independent ICC Voting Academy* and fans around the world will now be invited to cast their votes to decide the winners, which will be announced next week. Fans will be able to vote for their favourite performers at icc-cricket.com/awards.

The Irish pacer featured in all three formats in March, making strong contributions in all. However, it was in the longest format where Adair made his biggest impact, spearheading Ireland to their first ever men’s Test victory with their win over Afghanistan in Abu Dhabi. Adair bowled superbly to take five for 39 in the first innings, and followed up with three for 56 in the second, which included the prized wickets of skipper Hashmat Shahidi and Ibrahim Zadran. This Player of the Match performance preceded more wickets in the subsequent ODI and T20I series, and Adair finished the month with 16 wickets across all three formats.

Despite their ICC World Test Championship series against Australia ending in defeat, the New Zealand seamer was a shining light for the Blackcaps during March. Henry was the primary threat with the ball in the first innings of the first Test in Wellington, dismissing both Australian openers in a fiery spell that heralded five wickets. The first innings of the second Test also saw Henry at his best – the 32-year old blitzing the middle order to take seven wickets for 67. With 17 wickets across his two Tests at an average of 15.70, the 32-year-old demonstrated trademark consistency and accuracy throughout, capping his performances with the Player of the Series accolade.

The 25-year-old batter registered modest scores in Sri Lanka’s T20I series against Bangladesh at the start of the month, but followed with a memorable record-breaking performance in the first Test in Sylhet. Striding to the crease at 57 for five, Mendis partnered with Dhananjaya de Silva to rescue the Sri Lanka innings, striking 102 as they eventually posted a respectable score of 280. Facing similar troubles in the second innings at 126 for six, Mendis alongside De Silva once more re-asserted control, and the former’s mammoth innings of 164 in 237 balls helped his side to a comfortable victory, and saw him become the first player batting at number seven or lower to hit two centuries in a single Test.
