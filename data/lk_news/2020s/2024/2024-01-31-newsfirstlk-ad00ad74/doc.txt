Informed, Civilized Society Key to Economic Development – President

(PMD) President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that the foundation of a nation’s economy lies in fostering an enlightened and cultured society. He made these remarks during the inauguration of the new building complex at the Kelaniya University Postgraduate Institute of Pali and Buddhist Studies this morning (31).

The President underscored Sri Lanka’s pivotal role as the heart of Theravada Buddhism, expressing the nation’s duty to delve deeper into the Dharma and share its wisdom globally. Highlighting plans for the future, he announced the intention to establish a research institute dedicated to Theravada Buddhism, recognizing the potential of such institutions to propagate the teachings and strengthen ties between Buddhist nations.

In addressing the evolving technological landscape, President Ranil Wickremesinghe affirmed the commitment to enhance Sri Lanka’s education system in line with the demands of the digital age. He further revealed plans to introduce artificial intelligence courses across all universities.

The President also said that he is ready to provide the land and government support to build a student hostel at the Post Graduate Institute of Pali and Buddhist Studies as requested by the students.

As a gesture of gratitude, President Ranil Wickremesinghe presented commemorative gifts to foreign donors who contributed to the construction of the new building complex.

In 2019, I assumed the role of Prime Minister to lay the foundation stone for the construction of this building. Today, as the President I inaugurate this structure, in which its progress was hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Ven. Ratanasara Thera’s initiative to establish the Pali and Buddhist Institute at Vidyalankara University is commendable, and Ven. Rahula Anunayake of Kotapitiya played a significant role in the building’s construction.

The teachings of Buddha, crucial for navigating life’s challenges, hold immense importance. This institute has the potential to delve into these teachings deeply and disseminate them globally. Nearly fifty years have passed since the institution’s inception, marking a milestone.

Beyond benefiting Buddhist nations, this institute can contribute to fostering understanding of Theravada Buddhism in other countries, fostering stronger ties among Theravada nations. Excavations for the grand temple have commenced, led by the Maya Devi excavation team from Lumbini. Plans for a research institute to further study Buddhism are underway, with a comprehensive report expected by year-end.

As a government, our efforts are focused on promoting Theravada Buddhism globally. This institution plays a crucial role in fostering relationships among international Buddhist nations.

Furthermore, the upcoming free trade agreement with the Prime Minister of Thailand is anticipated to enhance the bonds between Sri Lanka and Thailand, both being Buddhist countries.

In tandem with technological advancements, we aim to create an environment that allows technology to explore Buddhist teachings. Artificial intelligence plays a vital role in this endeavour. Collaborating with the Minister of Education, we are actively pursuing the introduction of artificial intelligence courses in every university. The rapid evolution of technology demands a responsive education system, and we aspire to fortify Sri Lanka’s educational landscape accordingly.

Recognizing that the country’s progress is intricately linked to knowledge and a cultured society, we remain committed to strengthening the education system to meet the demands of the technology era, ultimately contributing to the bolstering of the nation’s economy.
