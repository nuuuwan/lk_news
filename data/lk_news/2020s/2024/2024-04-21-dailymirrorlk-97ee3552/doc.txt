MSME holds inaugural ceremony

The Ceylon Federation of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)'s inaugural ceremony was held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) with the presence of distinguished guests from both local and international spheres. The vision of the MSME is the imperative need for Sri Lanka to transition towards a manufacturing economy, a transformation that cannot be realized within the current framework of laws and regulations primarily favoring imports and trade.
