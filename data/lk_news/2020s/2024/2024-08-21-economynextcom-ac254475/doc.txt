Neon and Echelon Unveil Shine 50: Sri Lanka’s Young Game-Changing Women

Neon and Echelon have launched Shine 50, an initiative spotlighting 50 young women boldly making significant contributions and driving change across Sri Lanka. These trailblazers, from entrepreneurs and environmental advocates to artists and activists, are redefining leadership and innovation in their fields.

Dubbed “The Girls Who Run the World,” Shine 50 honours women between the ages of 18 and 35 for their impact on society and their role in driving change across diverse fields, from agriculture to art, business, social enterprises, education, environment, technology, entertainment, and science. The honorees represent regions across the country, including Jaffna, Galle, Batticaloa, Colombo, and the Central Hills.

Supported by USAID and sponsored by Seylan Bank as the Platinum Sponsor, the initiative highlights inspiring stories from across the country. These include Meera Nadaraasa, an LGBTQ+ advocate in Batticaloa who creates safe spaces and raises awareness about LGBTQ+ rights through Anicham Media; Maneka Warangi, Co-founder of Ocean Theory, who has reimagined school textbooks as board games and comic books; Lakmini Weerakkody, who founded a business addressing the rising demand for dehydrated natural foods and provides sustainable livelihoods for rural women; and Husna Naleer, who, despite her hearing impairment, uses her Instagram series, Insight into the Deaf World, to challenge stereotypes and promote inclusivity.
