ECONOMYNEXT  – Sri Lanka’s cabinet has approved a plan by the Ministry of Health to buy medical supplies from local companies for one year, according to a government statement.

The Medical Supplies Division of the Ministry of Health has found that 49 local companies could supply 454 types of medical supplies including medicines.

The cabinet had approved entering into agreements with identified companies for one year for medical supplies and medicines.
