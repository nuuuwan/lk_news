Pro-RW Pohottuwa faction forms new alliance

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MPs who have pledged their support to President Ranil Wickremesinghe have formed a new political alliance.

The formation of the alliance was announced by State Minister Premitha Bandara Tennekoon yesterday. He also revealed that Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana will serve as the General Secretary of the new alliance.

Addressing the media in Colombo, Tennekoon said that the goal is to form a broad alliance comprising a majority of MPs from the SLPP Parliamentary group. He announced that the work of the alliance will commence in the next few days.

He noted that discussions had taken place and decisions were made regarding the office bearers. He also emphasised that the group is united and has no disagreements about the decisions that were made.

He said the group is determined to create a platform where both right-wing and left-wing politicians can come together. Tennekoon declined to reveal the leader of the alliance but stated that the announcement would be made shortly.

He noted that the group had not yet discussed the formation of the new alliance with the SLPP, though they had previously warned the SLPP leadership that this outcome was likely. Tennekoon emphasised that the focus should be on prioritising the countryâ€™s stability and well-being over party or personal political agendas.
