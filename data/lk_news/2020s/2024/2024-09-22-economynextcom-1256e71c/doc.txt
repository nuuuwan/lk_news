Sri Lanka Foreign Minister congratulates Anura Dissanayake on winning Presidential poll

ECONOMYNEXT  – Anura Kumara Dissanayake of Sri Lanka’s National People’s Power, backed by the Marxist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, has taken an early lead in postal votes of the Presidential election 2024 declared so far.

“After a long and arduous campaign, the results of the election are now clear,” Foreign Minister Ali Sabry said in an x.com post.

“Though I heavily campaigned for President Ranil Wickremasinghe, the people of Sri Lanka have made their decision, and I fully respect their mandate for Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

“In a democracy, it is crucial to honor the will of the people, and I do so without hesitation. I extend my sincere congratulations to Mr. Dissanayake and his team.”

Out of results declared so far, made of 18 postal votes and three divisions, Dissanayake has got 54 percent, Sajith Premadasa 20 percent and Ranil Wickremesinghe 19 percent.

Wickremesinghe went to the polls in a stabilization crisis, after macroeconomists cut rates with inflationary domestic operations, triggering a collapse of the currency from 200 to 360 to the US dollar and 70 percent annual inflation and external default, making it difficult for people to make ends meet.

Sri Lanka suffered a series of currency crises since the end of a 30-year civil war attempting to target a policy rate, despite having reserve collecting central banks.

Crises worsened after the International Monetary Fund gave technical assistance to the central bank to calculate potential output.

The agency printed money to narrowly target a call money rate to reach potential output, a type of Keynesian stimulus, denying the monetary stability that comes from a wide policy corridor to the nation.

Wickremesinghe took over as President after Gotabaya Rajapksa fled the country amid fuel and forex shortages from the rate cuts. Food prices came down from peaks.

However many middle class wage earners were hit by direct taxes, further reducing purchasing power take away by macro-economists through the currency collapse, driving many to leave the country.

Wickremesinghe attacked Premadasa for ‘running away’ and not taking up his responsibility as an opposition leader.

During his time, the central bank restored monetary stability and started re-building reserves.

Dissanayake campaigned on a promise of eliminating corruption, which many blamed for the economic ills of the country.

Dissanayake, has three legislators in the 225 parliament and has promised a quick elections. (Colombo/Nov22/2024)
