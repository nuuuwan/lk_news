Hemas Hospitals launches ‘BreastOber 2024’ – A renewed commitment to champion breast cancer awareness

As Breast Cancer Awareness Month returns this October, Hemas Hospitals is stepping up its commitment with the launch of ‘BreastOber 2024.’ This annual initiative is aimed at educating women on the importance of early detection while improving access to life-saving diagnostic tools. With breast cancer remaining the most common form of cancer among women globally, the need for awareness and action is more critical than ever.

With breast cancer being the most common form of cancer among women globally, the numbers remain alarming. There were approximately 2.3 million women newly diagnosed with breast cancer globally, and the disease claimed about 670,000 lives. (Source: World Health Organisation (WHO)) Despite these challenging statistics, there is hope—early detection can dramatically increase survival rates and make treatment far more effective. This is the critical message Hemas Hospitals aims to reinforce through its 2024 ‘BreastOber’ campaign, emphasizing that proactive screenings are essential to catching the disease in its most treatable stages.

For 2024, Hemas Hospitals is offering Sri Lankan women the chance to take proactive steps towards early detection through their advanced, pain-free mammogram technology, dispelling any discomfort or anxiety often associated with traditional mammogram procedures. The hospital’s continued focus on ensuring a comfortable experience is aimed at encouraging more women to undergo this critical screening process.
