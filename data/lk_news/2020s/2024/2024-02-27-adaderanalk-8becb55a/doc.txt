University non-academic staff to launch two-day strike

The non-academic staff members of state universities have decided to go on a two-day token strike over several demands including a salary hike.

Accordingly, the strike will be held tomorrow (Feb.28) and the day after (Feb.29), University Trade Union Joint Committeeâ€™s Dhammika Priyantha said.

The committee vowed to resort to a continuous trade union action in the event the respective authorities fail to address their issues within one week.
