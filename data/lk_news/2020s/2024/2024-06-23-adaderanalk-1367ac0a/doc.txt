Sri Lanka women’s cricket team makes historic top five entry in ODI rankings

In a historic milestone for Sri Lankan cricket, the national women’s team has climbed into the top five of the ICC Women’s ODI Team Rankings for the first time ever.

This groundbreaking achievement comes as it climbed up two spots in the Women’s ODI Team Rankings after completing a clean sweep of the ODI series against the West Indies, clinching a decisive 3-0 victory.

Their recent series victories and standout individual performances have been pivotal in securing their place among the top five ODI teams. The team, led by veteran Chamaru Athapaththu has only lost one match out of the six ODI matches they played so far in 2024.

Meanwhile, several players of the Sri Lanka women’s team have also climbed up several spots in both ODI batting and bowling rankings after their brilliant individual performances.
