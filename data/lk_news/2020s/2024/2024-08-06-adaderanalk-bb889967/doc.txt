Body of missing Dematagoda Railway Yard employee found inside unguarded well

The body of the missing employee at the Dematagoda Railway Yard has been discovered from an unguarded well within the compound.

Earlier today, the train services from Colombo Fort had been temporarily disrupted due to workers at the Dematagoda Yard withdrawing from duties on claims that proper action was not being taken to find a fellow employee who had gone missing.

As a result, the ‘Podi Menike’ and ‘Badulla Odyssey’ trains, which were scheduled to depart from Colombo Fort to Badulla this morning, did not operate.
