Sri Lanka food prices increase 33.72 pct y-o-y in December: Advocata

ECONOMYNEXT – Food prices in Sri Lanka increased 33.72 percent year-on-year in December 2023, according to a rice and curry price index by free market think tank Advocata.

Advocata’s Bath (rice) Curry Indicator (BCI), a price index that tracks monthly changes in the retail price of a basket of commonly consumed food items using prices collected from the Pettah market by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), showed that, in real terms, an average family that spent 1825.85 rupees weekly on a packet of rice and curry in December 2022 had to pay 2440.25 rupees in December 2023.

When considering the Y-o-Y percentage monthly price changes within the BCI for year 2023, it reveals an opening of 35.01 percent in January,  dropping to a peak low of -3.88 percent in August and gradually rising to 8.86 percent in November and experiencing a sharp increase to 33.72 percent in December, Advocata said in a statement on Tuesday January 30. However, compared to the year 2023, the think tank said, the  year 2022 saw an average increase in monthly Y-o-Y percentage price changes in all-year except for January 2022 and December 2022.

“In contrast to 2022  figures, the price of brinjals has increased by 85.3 percent, tomatoes by 134.6 percent, and green chilies by 322.5 percent, while the price of dhal has decreased by 18.6 percent, and red onions saw a reduction of 13.7 percent. These are the items that had a significant impact on the BCI price change in December 2023.”

Advocata’s BCI Supermarket index, which tracks the price of the same basket of food items as they retail at local supermarkets, in 2023 also consistently trended in parallel with the BCI (CBSL) throughout 2023.

“The Advocata BCI tracks the weekly retail prices in the Colombo market of the most commonly consumed food ingredients that might be used in a typical [rice and curry] meal. The prices are collected from the ‘Weekly Indicators. that the Central Bank publishes.
