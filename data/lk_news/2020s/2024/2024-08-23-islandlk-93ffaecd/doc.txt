Another sobering knock

The Supreme Court (SC) has ruled that in 2023, President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, and the then members of the Election Commission (EC) violated the fundamental rights of the people by postponing the Local Government (LG) polls. The SC has ordered the EC to conduct the delayed polls as soon as possible.

One can only hope that the sobering judicial knock, which has gladdened the hearts of all those who cherish democracy, will have the desired impact on the Executive and others responsible for undermining the electoral process. It is heartening that the government politicians’ despicable attempts to intimidate the judiciary by issuing warnings and threatening to summon judges before parliamentary committees have been in vain.

The government’s audacious claim in 2023 that it was not in a position to allocate funds for the conduct of the LG polls in view of the country’s economic woes was an affront to the judiciary and the EC. President Wickremesinghe would not have been able to scuttle the LG polls in that manner without the help of the SLPP, whose MPs exulted when the Finance Ministry declared that it was without funds for the mini polls.

Both the UNP and the SLPP did not want the LG polls held because they were wary of facing an electoral contest. It was the 2018 mini polls that marked the beginning of the end of the Yahapalana alliance; the SLPP trounced both the SLFP and the UNP at those LG elections, causing a rift in the Yahapalana government. The SLPP and the UNP did not want the same fate to befall their fragile union, last year.

The postponement of the PC and LG polls has enabled President Wickremesinghe to consolidate his control over all three tiers of government. He now controls the PCs and the LG institutions through the provincial Governors appointed by him while keeping Parliament under his thumb.

In its welcome judgement, the SC has made it unequivocally clear to President Wickremesinghe that his executive powers are not without limits; he has to exercise his authority within the confines of the Constitution, and any attempt to overstep them will fall foul of the law. The candidates vying for the presidency and apparently salivating at the prospect of being able to savour unbridled executive powers ought to take cognisance of the message in the aforesaid SC ruling.

Many were those who worked in tandem to derail the LG polls called by the EC last year, and they include some officials of the Finance Ministry, the Government Press, etc. Shouldn’t legal action be instituted against these panjandrums as well for collaborating with the political authority to suppress the electoral process in violation of the people’s franchise?

But for the constitutional provisions pertaining to the term of the president, the powers of the EC, etc., the government would have striven to deny the public an opportunity to exercise their franchise this year as well. It stands accused of having made two attempts to plunge the country into a politico-legal mess by having two individuals go to the Supreme Court over some non-issues in respect of the length of the presidential term in a bid to delay the presidential election, but thankfully its efforts failed. Its attempt to defer the presidential election by moving a bill, which was a Trojan horse, to amend the Constitution purportedly to make the length of the presidential term clear also went pear-shaped.

Politicians have been able to make the LG and PC elections ‘disappear’ because there are no constitutional safeguards against political interference with the conduct of these polls. There is a pressing need to amend the Constitution to specify the periodicity of the LG and PC polls as well so that the country’s electoral process will be insulated from political interference.
