Cabinet nod to prepare Bill to amend Consumer Affairs Authority Act

The Cabinet of Ministers on Tuesday approved the proposal to expedite the preparation of a Bill to amend the Consumer Affairs Authority Act No. 9 of 2003, following the observations received from the Attorney General.

On 2 May 2023, the Cabinet initially gave the green light to draft amendments to the Act.

The Legal Draftsman has since prepared the draft Bill, which has now been reviewed by the Attorney General, who provided key observations and recommendations.

The proposal made by the Trade, Commerce and Food Security Minister Nalin Fernando to advise Legal Draftsman to prepare the relevant Bill promptly was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
