Footwear and Leather Fair 2024

The 14th Footwear and Leather Fair 2024 started at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) today. The exhibition will be held until Sunday (11).

“High quality, sustained volumes and competitive pricing have been key factors contributing to the success of Sri Lanka's footwear and leather products industry,” organisers said.

“Sri Lanka produces a wide range of modern shoes in many designs for men and women, rubber boots, beach slippers, safety shoes, sports and canvass shoes. Sri Lankan footwear exporters have established suppliers to many high-end international footwear brands,” they said.

It said that high-quality Sri Lankan leather goods in the range of leather gloves, travel bags, backpacks, ladies' handbags, jackets and small leather goods cater to niche international markets. Pix by Kithsiri de Mel
