Immigration nabs Indians violating work visa conditions in N’eliya restaurants

Colombo, March 30 (Daily Mirror) - Three Indian nationals who were engaged in employment at restaurants in Nuwara-eliya by violating their work visa conditions were nabbed by the Immigration and Emigration Department yesterday.

The department’s Investigation Division on information made the arrests from two restaurants in Nuwara-eliya, where the foreigners have violated their work visa conditions.

A senior official of the department told the Daily Mirror the Indian nationals had been granted employment visas to work in a particular restaurant in Nuwara Eliya and they were found working elsewhere.

The officer said that usually these kinds of work permits are not given to the individual but to the place of work and the foreigner is supposed to work only at that particular place of work. If one does not want to work there anymore his work visa will be cancelled, he said.

The arrested foreigners will be brought to Colombo and detained at the department’s detention centre in Welisara before they are sent from Sri Lanka. The inquiries were conducted under the instructions of the Immigration and Emigration Controller General Harsha Ilukpitiya.
