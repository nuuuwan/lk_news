Maximum retail price for eggs expected next week

Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera emphasizes that although the cost for producing an egg in Sri Lanka is Rs. 30, the price of a local egg in the market has risen to Rs. 60.

Accordingly, the Minister said that steps would be taken to impose a maximum retail price (MRP) for eggs with immediate effect in order to prevent the manufacturers and traders from unfairly profiting by overcharging the consumers.

Amaraweera further mentioned that the new maximum retail price would be submitted to the Consumer Affairs Authority next week.
