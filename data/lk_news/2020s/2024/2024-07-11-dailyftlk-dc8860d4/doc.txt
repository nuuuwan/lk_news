FPC led by Dullas to back Sajith at Presidential polls

Freedom People’s Congress (FPC) member and Parliamentarian Prof. Charitha Herath has announced that the party, led by MP Dullas Alahapperuma, will support Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa in the upcoming Presidential Election.

Addressing a press conference in Colombo yesterday, Herath explained that the FPC has decided not to field its own candidate and will instead support the SJB’s candidate.

“Our stance is that the Opposition must come together to form a broad alliance in order to defeat the Government. Accordingly, we held discussions with several political parties,” he said.

Herath revealed that the discussions held between the FPC and SJB were successful, leading to the FPC’s decision to support Premadasa.

He said accordingly the FPC will form an alliance with the SJB in the coming weeks.

Herath noted that while many groups have already joined the Samagi Jana Sandhanaya (SJS) led by the SJB, more are expected to join them shortly. “We will form a broad alliance with all their support,” he said.

Herath emphasised their goal to present a strong team and program to the country, aiming to secure victory by fielding one candidate for the Presidency.

“The discussions held by the FPC with the SJB on how to defeat the Government were very successful. We are going to work directly with the Opposition in the next few weeks to bring about a broad political change in the country,” he said.

When asked by the media, Herath refused to disclose the conditions discussed in exchange for extending their support to the SJB.
