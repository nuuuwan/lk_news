SLC to obtain services of Jonty Rhodes, Bharat Arun and Alex Kountouri

Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) says it has obtained the services of former South African cricketer Jonty Rhodes and Bharat Arun, the former India fast bowling coach, to provide advanced training to local coaches and trainers. The board has also roped in former Sri Lankan physiotherapist Alex Kountouri.

“Sri Lanka Cricket decided to obtain the services of some of the best-known talents in international cricket to provide advanced training for local coaches, trainers, and physiotherapists to enhance their skills and competencies by conducting periodic training programmes in selected areas,” a release by the board stated.

The board also announced an award scheme to recognise and compensate junior cricketers. A decision was also taken to increase the match fees of the players participating in the National Super League.

The Executive Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket, headed by President Shammi Silva, met on January 16, 2024, and took several decisions for the advancement of the game in the country.

Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) decided to introduce an award scheme to recognize and compensate the junior cricketers who perform exceptionally well during the Sri Lanka school cricket tournaments, conducted annually by the Schools Cricket Association of Sri Lanka in collaboration with SLC.

The recognition of these cricketers will commence from the U15 category, leading up to U17. The new program will commence with effect from the 2024 season.

Sri Lanka Cricket also plans to introduce an U21 tournament to create a pathway for the young cricketers leaving school to continue playing the game, perform, and graduate to the national level through the pathway.

Once in place, the new tournament will complement the U23 Tournament, which is conducted annually.

Accordingly, the Executive Committee recommended initiating a discussion with all the relevant stakeholders and getting the proposed tournament on the ground.

A decision was taken to increase the ‘match fee’ of the players of the National Super League, effective from the ongoing tournament.

The move is aimed at recognizing the efforts of those players, economically strengthening them, and retaining the players as professional cricketers in the domestic system.
