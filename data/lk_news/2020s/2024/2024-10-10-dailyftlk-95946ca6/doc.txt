Connecting grassroots to global, the festival invites investors, entrepreneurs, and industry leaders—both international and local—to be part of Sri Lanka’s transformative journey, a new future in the making. SLDF offers a diverse range of opportunities, from engaging with talented design graduates and exploring collaboration and recruitment options, to showcasing at the interior and product exhibitions. Attendees can also discover emerging design and consumer trends with global insights, while sharing and gaining new knowledge at the thought leadership forums.

SLDF 2024 public program speaks directly to the interests of the business community. SLDF not only offers opportunities for networking but also equips entrepreneurs and corporate teams with practical takeaways to enhance their strategic initiatives.

One of the highlights is the LSN Global event with the world’s premier trend forecasting agency Future Laboratory founders Chris Sanderson and Martin Raymond will provide valuable insights into consumer behaviour.

In addition, the Design Thinking Workshop by Aimee Kyffin emphasises the importance of collaboration across disciplines. This session will empower educators and business leaders alike to harness design thinking for innovation, encouraging attendees to rethink traditional approaches to problem-solving.

The Voices of Renewal panel will feature influential women such as Ramya Jirasinghe, Rosanna Flamer-Caldera, and Anoma Wijewardene, who will explore the intersection of art and activism.

Moreover, the Architectural Diplomacy session, featuring internationally acclaimed local architects Channa Daswatte and Palinda Kannangara will discuss the growing influence of Sri Lankan design culture on international projects, particularly in India. Their insights will shed light on how local architects are not only preserving their unique identity but also shaping perceptions globally — an essential aspect for businesses looking to leverage design as a diplomatic tool.

SLDF public program is designed to offer substantial takeaways for attendees. This program also includes exhibitions that feature emerging talents and innovative projects, presenting businesses with fresh ideas and potential collaboration opportunities. By engaging with these initiatives, business leaders can gain a deeper understanding of how creativity drives economic revival and explore pathways for collaboration with local creative industries.

SLDF 2024 is not merely an event; it serves as a strategic initiative to showcase the economic significance of creative industries in revitalising the nation.

Sri Lanka stands at a critical juncture in its economic journey, marked by resilience and the promise of renewal. Following a series of challenges, the nation’s creative industries can be leveraged as a catalyst for recovery.

SLDF focus on creative industries supports this broader understanding of their role in economic revival, as evidenced by global trends where creativity has become a fundamental driver of economic growth and resilience.

The collaboration with Cinnamon Life, Colombo’s premier venue for culture and creativity, symbolises the integration of design with lifestyle, illustrating how these elements can reshape Sri Lanka’s economic landscape. As the festival highlights the country’s potential to emerge as South Asia’s creative hub, it emphasises the importance of collaboration and innovation in driving growth across various sectors.

As the world increasingly recognises the interconnectedness of creativity and economic success, Sri Lanka’s commitment to fostering innovation through platforms like SLDF is both timely and essential. The festival not only promotes the creative economy but also showcases how these sectors can contribute significantly to national prosperity and a sustainable future.
