Rise in high blood pressure observed among Sri Lankan adults

Consultant Community Physician Dr. Sherine Balasingham of the Health Ministry’s Directorate of Non-Communicable Disease says that the number of patients with high blood pressure reported in Sri Lanka has increased.

She revealed that following a survey carried out covering all districts in the island on the adult population between the ages 18-69 years, it was reported that 35% of them are suffering from hypertension.

She further stated that several programmes are held globally each year on May 17 to raise awareness on high blood pressure and on the third week of May regarding salt intake.

Dr. Balasingham stated that a survey is also conducted in Sri Lanka once every 5 years and that according to the statistics of the last survey conducted in 2021, 35% of the individuals who took part in the survey had high blood pressure.

She added that the recommended sodium intake by an adult is 05 grams per day, however the survey has revealed that the daily intake of sodium by an adult is around 14.2 grams per day, which is three times more than the recommended amount.

Expressing her opinion regarding the prevention of high blood pressure, she stated that “to maintain good health, it is important to reduce the amount of salt used in food as well to eat healthy. It is also important to increase physical activities to mitigate mental stress.”

Dr. Balasingham also emphasized the importance of voiding the use of tobacco and alcohol as well as measuring your blood pressure frequently. “Especially those above the age of 35 years who have not measured their blood pressure yet, should measure it immediately,” she said.
