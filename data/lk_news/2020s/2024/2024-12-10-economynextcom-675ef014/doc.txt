Sri Lanka to issue digital driving license

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Cabinet of Ministers have approved a proposal to issue digital driving licenses, Health and Media Ministers Nalinda Jayatissa said.

“The government has recognized the requirement of issuing a digital driver’s license, which is currently used in many countries of the world, with new technology, which will facilitate the exchange of data between related institutions,” Jayatissa told reporters.

Jayatissa said there have been problems cropping up in the issuance of driving licenses with many irregularities reported.

Until a new digital driving license is introduces in place of the currently used driving license, the current procedures for issuing driving licenses will be followed, he said. (Colombo/Dec10/2024)
