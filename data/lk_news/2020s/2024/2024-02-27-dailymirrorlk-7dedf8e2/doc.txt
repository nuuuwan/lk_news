Rise in hospitalization of children due to high temperature: Pediatrician

Colombo, Feb 27 (Daily Mirror) - Due to the high temperature during the past few weeks, many school students across the country have suffered from heat-related illnesses and hospitalised, Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) consultant pediatrician Dr. Deepal Perera said.

Therefore, the doctor requested parents and teachers to provide more fluids with adequate minerals to prevent children from getting dehydrated and suffering from heat shock during the present hot weather conditions.

"Failure to take sufficient fluids and minerals could lead to critical health complications such as fatigue, headache, drowsiness, vomiting, body pain, insomnia, increased sleepiness and loss of appetite," Dr. Perera said.

If children play in open areas without drinking water, they could suffer from dehydration and heat shock conditions.

Dr. Perera requested that the parents give their children two bottles of water when they go to school.

"We recommend natural liquids such as coconut water, lime, orange and porridge varieties for children these days," he added.

During these hot weather conditions, there can be an increase in skin diseases such as sweat blisters and eczema among children if they do not stay in the water for a longer time.

Therefore, it is recommended to bathe children at least twice a day and let them soak in water for at least 20 minutes. It can reduce the skin's discomfort, he said.
