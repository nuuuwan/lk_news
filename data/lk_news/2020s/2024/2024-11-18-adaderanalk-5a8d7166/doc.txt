Sri Lanka’s first vision-impaired MP to receive special seating arrangement in Parliament

The Secretary General of Sri Lanka’s Parliament, Kushani Rohanadeera, announced plans to introduce a special seating arrangement for the country’s first-ever vision-impaired Member of Parliament, in order to meet his requirements.

She stated that the Parliament is also addressing technical adjustments to accommodate the unique requirements of the new MP.

Sugath Wasantha de Silva, representing the National People’s Power (NPP), has been appointed as a Member of Parliament through the NPP’s National List, officially gazetted on Sunday (17).

Before entering politics, de Silva was a prominent activist championing the rights of the visually impaired and disabled communities. He currently serves as the President of the Visually Impaired Graduates’ Council (VIGC), where he has played a pivotal role in advocating for equal opportunities and accessibility for persons with disabilities.

De Silva’s journey has been one of resilience and determination. Losing his sight in childhood due to an accident, he overcame significant challenges to earn a degree from the University of Colombo. With more than 25 years of experience as a social welfare officer, de Silva’s contributions to society have earned him widespread recognition.

Mrs. Rohanadeera highlighted the Parliament’s commitment to inclusivity, stating, “We are working on ensuring that Mr. de Silva’s unique needs are met, including seating arrangements and addressing technical concerns to facilitate his participation.”
