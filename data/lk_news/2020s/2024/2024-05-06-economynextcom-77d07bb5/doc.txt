Sri Lanka tourism minister opposes VFS Global linked visa fees in cabinet

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Tourism Minister Harin Fernando said he has objected to fees charged from foreign tourists by VFS Global, a private company, though he has not resigned from cabinet.

“When the new proposal was introduced, VFS charges were not mentioned,” Fernando said in an X.com post.

Sri Lanka’s tourist visa went from 50 to 100 dollars as an online portal was shifted to IVF-GBS, VFS Global, a private contractor, following an unsolicited proposal.

Sri Lanka’s tourism minister has introduced ‘free’ visas to seven countries to boost visitors but the private companies are collecting 18.50 and another 7 dollar fee from visitors from those countries as well.

A purported resignation letter that was circulating was not genuine, Minister Fernando said, told cabinet he did not want “to be a part of the decision to increase any visa fees.”
