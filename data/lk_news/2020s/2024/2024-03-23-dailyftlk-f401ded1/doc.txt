American Premium commemorates World Water Day by teaming up with OrphanCare

For over three decades, American Premium Water Systems has stood as the pioneer in Sri Lanka’s bottled water industry, providing the purest and most hygienic water to quench the thirst of Sri Lankans. As the world commemorates World Water Day, American Water’s commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility shines through as they join hands with OrphanCare, an independent trust dedicated towards making a positive impact on the lives of orphans as they transit from their care homes to adulthood, while upholding the principles outlined in Article 2 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which ensure inclusivity irrespective of race, colour, religion or ethnicity.

As part of this novel partnership, American Premium Water Systems shall donate a portion of the proceeds from every sale of their 19-litre water bottle towards weaving a brighter future filled with opportunities for orphaned youth across Sri Lanka.

Established in 2019, OrphanCare aims to address a very important yet mostly unattended need of orphan children; which is securing the fate of orphans once they reach the age of 18 and are compelled to leave institutional care.

“At American Water, every bottle of water sold isn’t just refreshing, it’s making a difference. Through our partnership with the OrphanCare Trust, a portion of proceeds from each bottle goes towards supporting orphaned children avoid a second abandonment. So, every time you choose our water, you are not only hydrating yourself but also contributing to a brighter future for the vulnerable orphans. It’s a simple act with a big impact, ensuring that every sip counts towards a positive change,” stated American Premium Water Systems Group Managing Director M.H.M. Fazal.

Commenting on the partnership, OrphanCare Head Azad Zaheed stated, “At OrphanCare, our mission is to provide orphaned children with the support and resources they need to build a better future. We are grateful to American Premium Water for coming on board as one of our merchant partners, which will enable us to expand our reach and impact, ensuring that every orphan child has the opportunity to fulfil their potential.”
