Anti-Indian leader gets over two-third majority in Maldives parliamentary polls

ECONOMYNEXT – Pro-Chinese Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu’s People’s National Congress (PNC) secured a landslide victory in the Parliamentary elections held this weekend, the archipelago’s election results showed.

Muizzu’s “India Out” campaign helped massively for the election results, analysts say. The main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party led by pro-Indian and former President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih won only 15 seats from 65 in the previous parliament, local media reported.

The election was closely watched by regional powers India and China, which are competing for influence in the archipelago nation, which has a strategic location in the Indian Ocean.

Muizzu called China as his closest ally and developmental partner of the Maldives and for the first time in the Maldivian history, its president skipped India as the first port of call after being elected.

Muizzu has set a May 10 deadline to oust all the Indian troops from Maldives who had been tasked with flying and maintaining two helicopters and a plane, with civilian staff. His campaign theme for the presidential election was “India out,” accusing his predecessor of compromising national sovereignty.

He went to Beijing in January this year to discuss with Chinese President Xi L

Muizzu also permitted Chinese research ship to be docked in Maldivian soils after Sri Lanka banned such ships mainly due to Indian pressure, citing the security of the Indian Ocean. (Colombo/April 22/2024)
