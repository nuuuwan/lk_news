Some police officers misuse Yukthiya operation: MPs charge

Parliament, May 10 (Daily Mirror)- Innocent people including school children are arrested under the  Yukthiya Operation for minor offences in some police stations and they are unreasonably charged under Act 54 of the Criminal Procedure, several government MPs charged today.

SLPP MP Samanpriya Herath told Parliament that people have faced serious issues in the Kurunegala district as youth who are languishing in junctions and roads are also taken to police stations and charged under Act 54 of the Criminal Procedure.

He said eleven youths were arrested over a brawl in Narammala yesterday and five of them including a school boy had been charged under Act 54.

"The Acting OIC of the Narammala Police is acting very unreasonably. Action should be taken against him. When these youths are charged under Act 54, they come back to society as drug addicts. The Yukthiya operation is good. But, some police officers misuse it," the MP said.

He urged the Public Security Minister to look into this matter and take action.

SLPP MP Premanath C. Dolawatte said similar incidents were reported in most districts and said it is wrong to take the law into their own hands while  claiming to implement the law.

He said the Yukthiya Operation has come under heavy criticism due to the  actions of some officials.
