Rise in Russian tourists engaging in prostitution sparks concerns

Colombo, Feb 20 (Daily Mirror) - In the wake of an influx of tourists particularly from Russia following the implementation of a visa-free entry programme, concerns have been raised regarding the involvement of some Russian female tourists, engaging in illegal activities such as prostitution during their stay in Sri Lanka, the Daily Mirror learns.

In recent months, Sri Lanka has seen a surge in international visitors, particularly from countries like India, China and Russia following the implementation of a visa-free entry programme.

Sri Lanka's decision to implement a visa-free entry programme for visitors from seven countries, including Russia, is aimed at revitalizing the tourism industry which suffered a severe setback following the Easter Sunday attacks, the COVID-19 pandemic and the political crisis last year. However, concerns have now been raised regarding the oversight of individuals exploiting this programme for illicit purposes.

According to official statistics, tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka have soared, with a remarkable 103 per cent growth recorded in January 2024 compared to the same period in the previous year. In January, Sri Lanka received a total of 208,253 tourists. India topped the list with 34,399 visitors while Russia was second in the list bringing in 31,159 tourists.

It is learnt that a portion of Russian tourists arriving in Sri Lanka have been engaging in prostitution, particularly in areas like Colombo and certain star-class hotels.

It has been observed that many tourists opt to find companions through nightclubs, certain agents in hotels and women who are already working in the industry, with rates typically ranging from Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 45,000 per hour. Some local websites openly advertise these services, specifying rates and conditions. These services by Russian prostitutes primarily target VIP and VVIP customers.

This is at a time when the local sex trade also has a high demand, with more women forced to engage in prostitution to overcome the economic difficulties. The Daily Mirror recently reported that a rising number of Sri Lankan youth were engaging in prostitution to overcome the economic crisis and soaring cost of living, with charges ranging from Rs.3,000 to Rs.10,000 per hour.

When the Daily Mirror contacted the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration Harsha Ilukpitiya, he acknowledged the complexities faced by authorities in tackling this issue.

"We have allowed tourists from seven countries to arrive in the country visa-free, including Russia. We only grant these tourists a 30-day stay in Sri Lanka. However, some tourists exceed this period and return after leaving. We can only arrest tourists if they are found engaging in illegal activities, for which we require actionable information. Currently, we collaborate with the Air Force Intelligence Unit in the South to identify and deport tourists involved in illicit activities. However, we face challenges in obtaining information regarding tourists in Colombo and those staying in star-class hotels," he said.

He said the officials have conducted several raids in southern areas to identify tourists violating immigration rules and engaging in illicit businesses. "Many tourists have been arrested for offences such as money laundering, and they have been deported. Some tourists are involved in illegal activities such as money exchange and other professions during their stay," he said.

The Controller General noted that instances of tourists engaging in illegal activities such as prostitution are considered isolated incidents, making it challenging to identify and arrest those involved.

However, he affirmed plans to inform the intelligence unit to intensify efforts in tracing tourists engaged in illegal activities including prostitution in Colombo and other regions of the country.

Meanwhile, police sources said that the number of raids targeting tourists involved in illegal activities such as engaging in prostitution has reduced due to the major focus on the 'Yukthiya' operation aimed at cracking down on crime and drug-related offences.
