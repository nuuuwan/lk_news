Enhanced scholarship allowance announced

Colombo, Jan 28 (Daily Mirror) - The President's Fund, under the auspices of the President and the guidance of the Secretary to the President, announced the extension and enhancement of the scholarship programme for the year 2021/2022, the President Media Division (PMD) said.

While issuing a statement they said this initiative aims to identify and support financially-challenged students across all provinces of Sri Lanka, ensuring they have the means to pursue their education without hindrance.

In response to special requests from students, the President has decided to increase the existing monthly allowance of Rs. 5,000.00 to Rs. 6,000.00, effective February 2024.

This adjustment seeks to provide additional support to scholarship awardees, ensuring their financial well-being and uninterrupted learning until they sit for the G.C.E A/L examination. So far, 10 monthly instalments have been paid out.

Furthermore, the President's Fund is set to award grants to 5,000 students who achieved the highest educational qualifications in the G.C.E. Ordinary Level examination for the year 2022/2023. Each selected student will receive a monthly allowance of Rs. 6,000.00 until the completion of their school education, including the G.C.E. Advanced Level examination.

The President's Fund is actively engaged in the selection process at the regional level across all provinces and the scholarships are anticipated to be conferred once the selection process concludes.
