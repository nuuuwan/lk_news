Sri Lanka stocks close down, Hemas and Sampath push turnover

ECONOMYNEXT – The Colombo Stock Exchange closed down on Monday, data on its site showed.

The broader All Share Index closed down 0.56 percent, or 68.05 points, at 12,076; while the more liquid S&P SL20 Index closed down 0.63 percent, or 22.71 points, at 3,565.

Most of this came from two crossings: Hemas Holdings Plc (Rs125mn), and the share closed up at 81.40. The other was Sampath Bank Plc, which closed down at 77.90.

“A large part of this came from foreign buying interest,” Softlogic Stockbrokers said. “There is foreign interest around selected, good counters. And this is what is driving the market these days.”

Most banking stocks closed down in the day. Commercial Bank of Ceylon Plc closed flat at 103.50, Hatton National Bank Plc was down at 195.50, and DFCC Bank Plc was down at 73.90.

“With banks there is the concern about the haircut, and the write-backs being moderate. There could also be some profit taking.”

Retailers continued with their wait-and-see-approach, market participants said, for various reasons. (Colombo/Jul8/2024)
