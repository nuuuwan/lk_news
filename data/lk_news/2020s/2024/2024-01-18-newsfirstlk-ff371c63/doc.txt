1,092 Wanted Criminals Added to Sri Lankaâ€™s Facial Recognition Watchlist

COLOMBO (News 1st); In a major boost to crime investigation efforts, the Sri Lankan Police have deployed cutting-edge facial recognition technology at the Bandaranaike International Airport, Acting Inspector General of Police Deshabandu Thennakoon announced today.

He said this measure targets a critical loophole exploited by criminals, who often flee the country after committing serious offenses using forged passports. To combat this, authorities have uploaded images of 1,092 individuals identified as members of organized crime syndicates into the system.

"This advanced facial recognition software will automatically detect anyone on our watchlist, even if they attempt to disguise themselves," said the Acting Police Chief.
