Restaurant food prices to be reduced from tonight

Colombo, March 5 (Daily Mirror) - Based on the reduction of the electricity tariffs, the All Ceylon Restaurant and Restaurant Owners' Association has decided to reduce the prices of restaurant foods with effect from midnight today.

Its president Harshana Rukshan said they had increased the food prices from last Saturday according to the increase in production costs.

Accordingly, the price of a cup of plain tea and a cup of milk tea will be reduced by Rs. 5 and Rs. 10 respectively from tonight.

Moreover, he said the price of a packet of rice and curry lunch will be reduced by Rs. 25; a plate of fried rice, kottu will be reduced by Rs. 50; and the price of short eats will be reduced by Rs. 10 each.

However, the association said that due to the reduction in electricity charges, the prices of restaurant food items will be reduced again to their earlier prices.
