Expressing his gratitude, Sri Lanka National Arbitration Centre Chairman Hiran de Alwis commended BIAC for its proactive approach in initiating the MoU and helping both countries to work together for the promotion of ADR mechanisms as a means for peaceful, cost effective and expeditious settlement of international trade and investment disputes.

The presence of BIAC Chairman and International Chamber of Commerce – Bangladesh President Mahbubur Rahman underscored the importance of the occasion.
