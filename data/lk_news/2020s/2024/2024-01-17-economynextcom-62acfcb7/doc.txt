Sri Lanka cinnamon farmers GI-certified with IFC support

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is implementing geographical indication (GI) for cinnamon, where the country has a 90 percent market share, with 45 farmers and processors being formally recognized in a initiative supported by Washington-based International Finance Corporation, the agency said.

Sri Lanka cinnamon obtained GI certification in 2022 with support from the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). The certification provides a competitive advantage, helping increase market differentiation, and allowing for a premium price from the consumer.

“To better position and promote high quality exports of Ceylon Cinnamon, the IFC … recognized the first batch of Geographical Indication (GI) certified Ceylon Cinnamon growers in the country,” the IFC said in a statement. (Press Release – Ceylon Cinnamon GI Event)

“We want to better position this unique spice for the authentic, quality it brings by reaching across high-value global markets,” said Alejandro Alvarez de la Campa, Country Manager for IFC Sri Lanka and Maldives.

As part of the project, market research provider Euromonitor International carried out an assessment to identify high-value markets for Ceylon Cinnamon. Australia, Brazil, Germany, UK and the USA were identified as potential markets.

The initiative was supported by the European Union (EU), the Sri Lanka Standards Institution, the Industrial Technology Institute and the Department of Cinnamon Development. (Colombo/Jan17/20204)
