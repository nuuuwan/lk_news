SL collaborates with World Meteorological Organisation for Climate Resilience Program

Move aims to quickly and accurately predict high-risk weather and climate conditions

Expect to reduce $ 313 m annually spent by Govt. on post-disaster management activities

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved collaboration with the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) to enhance Sri Lanka’s emergency warning systems under the Climate Resilience Multi-Phase Programmatic Approach (CRMPA).

Funded by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank, the CRMPA is designed to be implemented over nine years in three phases. The program comprises five components, with the first component focused on improving the skills, technology and infrastructure of relevant institutions to enable accurate forecasting and pre-assessment of weather conditions.

“This initiative aims to quickly and accurately predict high-risk weather and climate conditions, potentially reducing the estimated $ 313 million annually spent by the Government on post-disaster management activities,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing on Tuesday.

He said the collaboration is expected to significantly improve the capability to manage and mitigate the impacts of adverse weather conditions, thereby enhancing the country’s overall climate resilience.

The proposal, presented by the Irrigation Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi was approved by the Cabinet.
