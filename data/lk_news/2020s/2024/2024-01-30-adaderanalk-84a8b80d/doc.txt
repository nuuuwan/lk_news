Three junior staffers of parliament arrested over abuse allegations

Three junior staff members of parliament have been arrested by the Child and Women’s Bureau of Police over abuse allegations.

The three suspects are accused of abusing two female staff members.

Meanwhile, in August 2023, a three-member committee initiated an internal investigation into the complaints on allegations of sexual abuse of the female employees of the parliament’s Catering and Housekeeping Department.

The committee was appointed in response to a question raised by MP Rohini Kumari Wijerathna during a parliamentary session. The committee was chaired by Secretary-General of Parliament Kushani Anusha Rohanadeera.

The parliamentarian had raised the matter in the parliament referring to media reports of the female housekeeping staffers of the parliament being sexually abused by other officials.
