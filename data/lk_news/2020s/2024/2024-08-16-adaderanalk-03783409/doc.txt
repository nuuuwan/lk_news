SJB denies rumors of alliance with former President Sirisena

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) media spokesperson S. M. Marikkar has dismissed reports claiming that former President Maithripala Sirisena has joined the ‘Samagi Jana Sandhanaya’.

Issuing a statement on behalf of the SJB, Marikkar clarified that there is no need for the ‘Samagi Jana Sandhanaya’ to form an alliance with the former president or seek his support.

Marikkar also emphasizes that the pro-government propaganda groups, who are in a frantic in the face of certain defeat in the upcoming presidential election, are engaged in a program of creating false news and spreading it through mass media and social media.

Therefore, Marikkar urged the public to be vigilant of such misinformation, emphasizing that the Samagi Jana Sandhanaya’s presidential candidate Sajith Premadasa poses a significant challenge to all opposing parties.
