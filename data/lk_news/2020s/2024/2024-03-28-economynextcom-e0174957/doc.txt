Sri Lanka to import onions from China after India export ban: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will import onions from China after an export ban by India and Pakistan pushed up domestic prices, Trade Minister Nalin Fernando said.

“Big onions, there is a shortage in India and Pakistan,” Fernando said. “Now we are importing from China.”

Fernando had previously said that a variety called Rose Onion will be imported instead of big onions due to rising onion prices.

Sri Lanka grows onions under import tax protection and domestic production is seasonal and imports supplement demand.

3,500 hectares of onions were planted in the 2023 yala season, but crops were destroyed by unusually heavy rains before harvesting, the Department of Agriculture said.

Demand remains high ahead of several religious and cultural festivals.

However, the Department of Agriculture said that 75,000 kilos of big onion bulbs were vernalized for planting in the 2024 yala season.

Fernando had previously said that Sri Lanka would need assistance with new technology in order to increase yields and combat food insecurity, in a meeting with US ambassador Julie Chung. (Colombo/Mar28/2024)
