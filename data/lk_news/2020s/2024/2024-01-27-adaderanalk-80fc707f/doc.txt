A 30-year-old was arrested on Friday (Jan.27) on suspicion of taking possession of the firearms after they were used in the mass shooting in Beliatta.

On Jan.23, a group of persons who had arrived in an SUV had opened fire at a white Defender near the Beliatta Interchange of the Southern Expressway.

In the shooting, which took place between 8:30 a.m. and 8:40 a.m., four persons were killed at the scene. The other person who was inside the Defender was rushed to the Tangalle Hospital with critical gunshot wounds, however, he succumbed to injuries shortly after.

Among the deceased was the leader of “Ape Jana Bala Pakshaya” (Our Power of People Party or OPPP) Saman Perera. The other four victims were identified as Sameera Madhusanka, Hasitha Chinsuka, Buddhika Rajapaksha, and Nalin Champika.

Thus far, three suspects have been arrested in connection with the incident.

On Thursday (Jan.25), the Deiyandara Magistrate ordered that the 55-year-old named Saman Kumara be detained until tomorrow for further interrogations. Based on the information divulged by the suspect during questioning, the investigating officers managed to locate a motorcycle and a van linked to the perpetrators.
