Colombo to become tourist city, no more aragalaya: Sri Lanka President

ECONOMYNEXT – Colombo city will be developed further into a tourist destination with the relocation of several features, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said.

Wickremesinghe outlined plans “for further development beyond Colombo, including relocating the President’s House to the Madiwela area within the next decade.”

There was “potential for transforming sites like Republic Square, Navy Headquarters, Old Jetty, Customs House and the General Post Office into key components of the burgeoning Colombo Tourist City,” Wickremesinghe was quoted as saying by his media divisions at the opening of the ITC Ratnadipa Hotel.

The luxurious hotel, located near the Galle Face Green, marks the first venture outside India by the ITC Hotel Group, following their establishment of a 10,000-room hotel chain in India.

“Two years ago this was the site of a huge struggle. Today we have a huge hotel in its place. We can’t go back to that stage.”

Wickremesinghe said he would foster an economic landscape that would prevent an ‘aragalaya’ [struggle] happening again in Colombo.

“With Colombo emerging as a bustling tourist destination and the presence of star-grade hotels offering hope for the future of tourism,” Wickremesinghe said, “the tourism sector would play a pivotal role in revitalizing the economy.”

Colombo has a diverse range of city hotels, including those representing India and Singapore. A Cinnamon Life project located behind the ITC Ratnadipa will add to the offering.

Wickremesinghe highlighted “the rich heritage of the Sri Lankan hotel industry,” noting the Oberoi Hotel as the pioneering city hotel in the country.

“The ITC Ratnadipa Hotel will serve as a symbol of Colombo city and tourism centred around Colombo.” (Colombo/Apr26/2024)
