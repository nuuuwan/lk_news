Kelaniya University Students Hold Ground After Tense Night

COLOMBO (News 1st); Following a clash with police last night and ongoing occupation of the university administration building, Kelaniya University students have been offered a direct dialogue with the Vice-Chancellor to address their concerns.

University administration confirmed the offer, stating that a discussion regarding student issues is scheduled for 1 pm.

However, students remain inside the administration building for the time being.

Campus security is informed and monitoring the situation, said the university administration.

The tension stems from students protesting the President's planned visit to Kelaniya University today.

Last night, Inter-University Student's Federation blocked the Kandy-bound lane of the Colombo-Kandy main road in protest, prompting police intervention.

The students eventually dispersed after tear gas and water cannons were deployed.
