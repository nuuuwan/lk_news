Sri Lanka telecom law change hits media freedom: opposition

ECONOMYNEXT – A proposed change to Sri Lanka’s Telecom Regulatory law will give powers to the commission to cancel license of electronic media, undermining media freedom, the opposition has warned.

“These changes to the Act contain several proposals that are detrimental to media freedom. One is the that you have to pay a fine to get your license back. Also the commission can interpret and decide what is not in the public’s interest,” Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said in parliament.

Premadasa said the opposition was against this, and would take legal action to challenge it.

“This will create a dangerous situation, where power will be concentrated among a few people who will be able to decide on the granting of the media license,” SJB MP S M Marikkar said.

“I know sometimes there is extortion to get the media license. When you grant greater power, there would be an increase in the opportunity for extortion.”

Leader of the House Minister Susil Premajayantha said he will inquire into the claim with Sri Lanka’s Telecom Regulatory Commission. (Colombo/May15/2024)
