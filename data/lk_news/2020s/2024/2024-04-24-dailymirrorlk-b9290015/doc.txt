NPP asks Sajith to propose convenient date unless he can participate on proposed four days

Colombo, April 24 (Daily Mirror)- The National People's Power (NPP) today requested Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leader Sajith Premadasa to propose a date convenient to him if he is unable to participate in any of the four days proposed by the NPP for the public debate between the two leaders.

NPP General Secretary Tilvin Silva told a news conference that the NPP proposed four days assuming that Sajith Premadasa would be busy and give him an opportunity to select any of the four days convenient to him.

"We proposed four dates, assuming that Sajith may be busy. Anura Kumara is also a busy person engaged in a tight schedule. We proposed four dates considering the importance of the debate. If the Sajith faction is claiming that this debate is so importatnt, they can choose any one of the four dates. If he is unable to make it on any of the four dates, we request him to propose a date convenient to him," he said.

Silva said Sajith Premadasa is attempting to evade the debate and added that he will not participate in the debate.

"He is only trying to find ways to evade the debate instead of trying face it," he added.
