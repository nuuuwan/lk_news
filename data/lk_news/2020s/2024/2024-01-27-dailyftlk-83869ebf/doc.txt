India’s 75th Republic Day celebrations in Sri Lanka

The High Commission of India, in Colombo celebrated India’s 75th Republic Day yesterday.

It was on 26 January 1950 that the Indian Constitution, the world’s largest written Constitution, came into force. The Preamble to the Constitution declares India to be a Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic.

On the occasion, High Commissioner Santosh Jha unfurled India’s national flag at India House, the residence of the Indian High Commissioner and inspected the Guard of Honour. The High Commissioner also read out excerpts of the Indian President’s Republic Day address.

The event featured songs by the Sri Lanka Navy band and a cultural program organised by the Indian High Commission’s cultural arm, Swami Vivekananda Cultural Center. India’s rich diversity was showcased at the cultural event with the performance of several folk dances that included Garba of Gujarat, India’s most recent inscription on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List of Humanity. Several members of the Indian community attended the ceremony.

Earlier in the day, the High Commissioner paid tribute to the fallen heroes of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) at the IPKF memorial.

A ceremonial reception was organised in the evening at India House, where several dignitaries from all walks of life in Sri Lanka attend.

This Republic Day marks over six months since the adoption of the India-Sri Lanka Economic Partnership Vision by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and President Ranil Wickremesinghe during the latter’s visit to India in July 2023. Both parties continue to work towards enhancing connectivity in all its dimensions, identified as the key enabler for a shared and sustainable economic prosperity.

The Consulates General of India in Hambantota and Jaffna and the Assistant High Commissioner in Kandy also observed the 75th Republic Day of India by organising special events.
