Thailand approves visa-free travel for Sri Lankan tourists

Colombo, May 30 (Daily Mirror) - Thailandâ€™s cabinet approved a range of visa promotions to attract more tourists from other countries, including Sri Lanka, Foreign Affairs Minister M.U.M. Ali Sabry said.

He said these measures include visa-free and visa-on-arrival schemes, longer stays for students, and reduced compulsory health insurance for retirees.

According to him, Sri Lankan tourists, along with visitors from 36 other countries including Albania, Cambodia, China, India, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Laos, Mexico, Morocco, Panama, Romania, Sri Lanka and Uzbekistan can now enter Thailand without a visa and stay for up to 60 days.

However, according to Thai government spokesman Chai Wacharonke, this expansion increases the number of countries eligible for visa-free entry from 57 to 93. The initiative aims to boost the national economy, which relies heavily on tourism, he said.

Visa-on-arrival: The number of countries eligible for visa-on-arrival has increased from 19 to 31.

Work and Travel Visas: Visitors who want to work while touring can get five-year visas valid for stays up to 180 days, extendable for another 180 days. This scheme targets digital nomads, remote workers, freelancers, and those interested in learning Muay Thai and Thai cuisine, dubbed the "Destination Thailand Visa."

Extended Stay for Students: Foreign students can now stay for one year after graduation, allowing them to find work in fields where Thailand needs skilled professionals.

These measures will take effect on Saturday, June 1, 2024. The Foreign Ministry proposed these changes to attract as many visitors as possible, emphasizing the importance of tourism to Thailand's economy.
