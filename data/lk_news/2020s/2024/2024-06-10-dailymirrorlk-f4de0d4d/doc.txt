Retired soldiers left for Russia to make ends meet: Defence Secy.

Colombo, June 10 (Daily Mirror) - The retired soldiers of Sri Lanka who dedicated their lives to the war left for Russia not to abandon the motherland but to make ends meet, who have been deceived by the scammers promising them a lucrative opportunity, opined Defence Secretary General Kamal Gunaratne.

Gunaratne said by toay 42 of the Sri Lankan ex-military had been brought to the country safely and still a large number remained to be gathered and dispatched from Moscow.

The Defence Secretary was addressing a special function held at the Ananda College Colombo today to mark the Ananda Walk 2024 scheduled on July 7, which would be themed under ‘Educate and Empower to Save Mother Lanka’.

Stressing on the fact that it is high time to take measures against the trending brain drain from Sri Lanka, General Gunaratne said the retired soldiers did not abandon the country like many others but went to earn a better life for their children and families.

“We have requested for the full list of soldiers who have joined the Russian-Ukraine war and will get a lot of information on a special two-day meeting to be held in Moscow with the Russian authorities on June 26 and 27.

So far, we have brought 42 members back to the country, which includes soldiers and those who are in the officer grade.

A soldier can go on retirement after completing 22 years in the local army and after that, they have to run their families by completing children’s education and so on, when they are merely 42 years in life,” the Secretary said.
