Sri Lanka to review exchange controls, amend FX act

ECONOMYNXT – Sri Lanka will review exchange controls imposed in the recent past allowing economic activities to take place, Central Bank Governor Nandala Weerasinghe said.

Sri Lanka’s Foreign Exchange Act will also be amended in early 2024.

“With the observed improvements in the liquidity position of the domestic foreign exchange market, the Central Bank would review the existing restrictions on certain capital foreign exchange outflows on a priority basis with a view to gradually unwinding these restrictions,” according to the text of the speech.

The exchange controls are complex and there are queries and clarification requested, he said, delivering an annual policy speech.

To businesses to engage in transaction they will be reviewed.

The Central Bank will introduce “proactive and timely policy measures” under Foreign Exchange Act.

“These policy measures are expected to further promote foreign exchange inflows to the country, while addressing stakeholder concerns, regulating the domestic foreign exchange market, and strengthening the surveillance of foreign exchange inflows and outflows,” the statement said.

Changes to the FEA will provide a “framework to regulate the functioning of the formal foreign exchange market more efficiently, while empowering the regulatory authorities to take prompt actions against violations of and/or non-compliance with foreign exchange transactions.”

Sri Lanka has capital controls, but additional controls were imposed from 2020 as money printing was intensified to boost growth.

Sri Lanka does not have free flow of capital due to not having a single anchor monetary regime (a clean float or a currency board). (Colombo/Jan10/2023)
