No media spectacles, Sri Lanka president says assuming duties as Agriculture Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s President Anura Dissanayake has officially assumed the duties as the Minister of Agriculture, Lands, Livestock, Irrigation, Fisheries, and Aquatic Resources, his media division said.

Dissanayake met with ministry officials after assuming office on Thursday (3).

“We will not publicly question officials in front of the media, as previous leaders have done, nor will we entertain such media spectacles,” Dissanayake said in a post on social media platform X.

• The Ministry’s role in eradicating rural poverty is immense, and the performance of our government officials will be key to our success.

• I am committed to advocating for our dedicated public servants to help create an efficient and responsive public service.

• Traditional political reprisals will not be tolerated in the future.

• We will not publicly question officials in front of the media, as previous leaders have done, nor will we entertain such media spectacles. My aim is to build a public service that both satisfies citizens and protects the dignity of public servants.”

Dissanayake has previously held the post of Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Land and Irrigation in the joint Sri Lanka Freedom Party – Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna government in February 2004.

Dissanayake’s JVP, now rebranded as the National People’s Power, had 39 seats in that parliament. (Colombo/Oct3/2024)
