New Cabinet to be sworn in today?

It is reported that the new Cabinet of Ministers to be formed under President Anura Kumara Dissanayake will likely be sworn in today (24).

Political sources said that this swearing-in of the new Cabinet is aimed at preparing for the upcoming General Election.

A special gazette had announced the appointment of Lakshman Nipuna Arachchi as a Member of Parliament, filling the vacancy created following Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s election as the new President.

Accordingly, this means that four representatives from the National People’s Power (NPP), including the President, will remain in Parliament and would receive Cabinet Ministerial portfolios.

The newly formed Cabinet is expected to serve in their positions until the new Parliament is elected.

After the swearing-in of the Cabinet of Ministers, President Dissanayake would convene the Cabinet and after allocating funds for a parliamentary election, the Parliament will be dissolved, political sources told Ada Derana.

Before the dissolution of the Parliament, several other new ministry secretaries are also scheduled to be appointed.

Accordingly, under the current situation it is likely that a Gazette notification regarding the dissolution of Parliament will be issued by midnight tonight (24).
