Geologists team to visit Uma Oya area to assess reports on cracks: Minister

Colombo, April 30 (Daily Mirror)- Claiming that there have been no reported landslides or other issues since the Uma Oya Project was opened, State Minister of Power and Energy Indika Anuruddha said a team of geologists will embark on an inspection tour of the Uma Oya region tomorrow to assess and document any reported cracks and floods in the area.

He cautioned against misleading representations, noting that some individuals are attempting to mislead the public by showcasing small waterfalls resulting from rainfall.

The Minister said this during a media briefing at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) today (30) under the theme “Collective Path to a Stable Country”.

"The country has suffered a loss of nearly USD 200 billion due to the nine-year delay in completing the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project. Consequently, the loss over the past nine years is estimated at USD 587 million.

The initial project estimate stood at USD 529 million. However, over the past nine years, electricity generation linked to the Uma Oya project could not be integrated into the national grid, resulting in the project incurring a loss equivalent to the estimated amount.

Despite the addition of electricity generation from the Uma Oya project to the national grid, misleading media reports suggesting the project caused landslides persist," he added.

"Some individuals aim to obstruct the project's progress by highlighting minor post-rain waterfalls. Notably, no confirmed incidents related to the project have occurred. However, tomorrow (01), a team of geologists will assess reported cracks and floods in the Uma Oya area.

"The government assures technical solutions to any identified issues, drawing from global experience in prevention measures. In the past, the country has experienced the loss of various development projects due to sabotage by certain individuals," he said.
