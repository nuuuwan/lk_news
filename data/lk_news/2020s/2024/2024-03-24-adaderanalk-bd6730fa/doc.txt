Sri Lanka’s economy should be main issue in next election - Semasinghe

State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe states that the country’s economy is still not out of danger and that this should be the main focus in the upcoming election.

Speaking to the media in Anuradhapura yesterday (23), the State Minister said a person who possesses the ability to manage the economy and have a clear vision should be elected during the coming election.

“The country’s economy should be the primary issue in the upcoming election. Priority should be given to individuals who possess the ability to manage the economy and have a clear vision, as the economy has yet to recover from its precarious state.”
