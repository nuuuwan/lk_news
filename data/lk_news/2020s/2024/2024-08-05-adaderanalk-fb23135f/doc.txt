A forty-two-day-old infant has tragically passed away after allegedly being inhumanely beaten by the child’s mother in the Alaveddy area in Jaffna.

Police said that the infant had sustained fatal injuries, including bruises to the head and other parts of the body.

The mother had initially admitted the baby to the Alaveddy Divisional Hospital, claiming the infant had lost consciousness after breastfeeding. The child has been subsequently transferred to Tellippalai Base Hospital.

However, the post-mortem examination has confirmed that the infant’s death resulted from a severe head injury.

Furthermore, it has been revealed that one of the child’s arms has been bruised and a leg fractured.
