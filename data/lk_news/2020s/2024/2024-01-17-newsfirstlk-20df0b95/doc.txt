Parliament Eyes Expanded Economic Zone in Indian Ocean

COLOMBO (News 1st); The Sri Lankan Parliament's Sectoral Oversight Committee on International Relations is exploring the potential of exploiting resources beyond the country's current exclusive economic zone (EEZ).

During a recent meeting on January 9, 2024, the committee, chaired by MP Akila Ellawala, focused on the National Oceanic Affairs Committee Secretariat (NOACS), an agency under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs responsible for maritime matters.

Dr. N.P. Vijayananda, the current chairperson of NOACS, presented to the committee the possibility of utilizing a sea area up to 250 nautical miles beyond the existing 200-nautical-mile EEZ for economic activities.

This area falls under the continental shelf jurisdiction as defined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

Dr. Vijayananda emphasized the need for regional cooperation, particularly with India, to access this area. He highlighted the region's potential for fuel exploration and its significance for Sri Lanka's marine biodiversity.

Committee Chair Ellawala expressed the need for swift action in pursuing this opportunity.

He stated that the committee intends to request the relevant minister to expedite negotiations with neighboring countries and coordinate efforts with the Ministry of Defense.
