Review of Sri Lanka noise pollution regulations given to Justice Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – A review of existing laws and regulations on noise pollution in Sri Lanka has been conducted and a report was handed over to the Minister of Justice.

“The expert committee has prepared the relevant report by studying the laws and regulations related to noise pollution around the world,” a statement by the Department of Government Information said.

The report of the committee appointed to review the existing laws was handed over by its Chairman, Supreme Court Justice Mahinda Samayawardena to the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe at the Ministry.

The team comprised officials from the office of the Solicitor General, Ministry of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reform, Ministry of Environment, Central Environment Authority, Police, and lawyers.

Sri Lanka has some provisions against noise pollution in its Noise Regulations No.1 of 1996 gazetted under the National Environmental Act, but this mostly deals with noise from industrial activities and not community activities. Places of religious worship and traders associations fond of loudspeakers use them at any time of day as existing regulations are not enforced.

Some motorists, too, pay scant regard about the effects of noise pollution, and opt to toot horns every step of the way. (Colombo/March27/2024)
