HUTCH Sri Lanka leads the way to ensure safe browsing for children

In an era where the internet shapes every aspect of our lives, from learning and communication to entertainment and beyond, its influence is undeniable. However, with this vast digital reach comes the critical responsibility to ensure safe and responsible usage, especially for children who are increasingly connected to the online world. As adults, we are well aware of the dangers that lurk online in the form of harmful content, individuals with malicious intent, and the risks associated with in-app purchases. These dangers are a constant threat to unsupervised children as they explore the internet.

With the demands of modern life, it is not practical to eliminate devices from your child’s life or completely restrict internet access. Online schooling, educational videos, and digital projects have become integral parts of a student’s life today. However, it is nearly impossible to constantly supervise your child’s online behaviour, given the fast-paced nature of adult responsibilities. This raises a crucial question: how can you ensure your child’s safety online while allowing them to benefit from the vast resources the internet offers?

At HUTCH, internet security is a top priority, and we are committed to ensuring and empowering a safe browsing culture for children as part of our ongoing responsibility to society. Our Children Safety Protocol is an ongoing project aimed at protecting young users as they navigate the online landscape. In the Sri Lankan context, where internet access is rapidly expanding, the importance of internet self-care cannot be overstated. By promoting awareness and providing tools for safer online practices, HUTCH is dedicated to creating a secure digital environment where children can explore, learn, and grow without exposure to harmful content.

As one of Sri Lanka’s leading telecommunications providers, Hutch Sri Lanka is dedicated to ensuring that users can navigate the online world securely. Understanding the unique challenges faced by younger internet users, Hutch Sri Lanka has introduced HUTCH Junior Internet Guard—an innovative solution designed to create a safer online environment for children. For the first time in Sri Lanka, a telecom operator offers an effective way to help parents protect, track, and understand their children’s time spent online.

These specialized packages, starting from just Rs. 215 for 1GB over 30 days, and ranging up to Rs. 1748, provide a variety of options to suit different needs, with a total of eight packages available. HUTCH Junior Internet Guard includes features such as content filters, limited browsing hours, and parental control options, ensuring that your child can explore the internet safely and responsibly. With this service, parents can enjoy peace of mind knowing their children are engaging with the digital world in a regulated and secure manner.

On Internet Self-Care Day, it’s crucial to recognize that self-care extends beyond physical and mental well-being—it includes taking steps to protect our digital health as well. By practicing good password hygiene, being mindful of the content we consume, and utilizing tools like Hutch’s safe browsing packages, we can all contribute to a healthier, more secure online experience.
