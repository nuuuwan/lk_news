Railways Department yet to calculate losses from strike

Colombo, June 10 (Daily Mirror) - The Railways Department has said that the losses incurred as a result of the non-operation of trains during the trade union strike initiated by the Sri Lanka Railways Locomotive Operating Engineers’ Union have not yet been calculated.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Sri Lanka Railways General Manager N.J. Indipolage said that the losses would be assessed by the end of this month.

He suggested that approximately five per cent of the revenue might have been lost due to the disruption in railway services.

Despite the train strike, several train services were operated while facilitating the transportation of many individuals.

"Only a few people utilized public services. Long-distance operating train services, including goods trains, continued to operate," he stated. "Therefore, the railways department did not experience significant losses." Indipolage said.
