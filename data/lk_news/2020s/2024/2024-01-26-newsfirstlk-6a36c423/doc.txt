The International Court of Justice determines that South Africa does have standing in its case against Israel

Colombo (News 1st) – ICJ says it has jurisdiction to rule on the genocide case. The presiding judge says the court will not throw away the case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza. Judge Donoghue says some allegations against Israel fall within the provisions of the Genocide Convention. ICJ president says the court recognizes the Palestinians’ right to be protected from acts of genocide. ICJ orders Israel to take all measures within its power to prevent genocide. It says Israel must ensure its forces do not commit genocide and also ensure the preservation of evidence of alleged genocide. Israel must report to the court within a month on what it is doing to uphold the order to take all measures within its power to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza. Judge Donoghue says the ruling creates international legal obligations for Israel. The International Court of Justice determined that it would reject Israel's request to dismiss the case initiated by South Africa. The International Court of Justice finds that the 'conditions to indicate provisional measures are met'. The International Court of Justice does not order a ceasefire in its ruling.
