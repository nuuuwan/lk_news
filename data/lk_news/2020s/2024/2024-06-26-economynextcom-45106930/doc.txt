Sri Lanka rupee steady 305.25/50 to the US dollar, bond quoted wide

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s rupee was quoted at 305.25/50 to the US dollar in early morning trade Wednesday, steady from 305.25/35 to the US dollar at yesterday’s close while bonds were quoted wide, dealers said.

Bond market activity was somewhat muted after a rise in Treasury bill yields last week, dealers said.

Interest rates fell after a spike in un-sterilized liquidity from dollar purchases (strong side pegging), but the rupee comes under pressure due to lack of a complementary exchange rate policy to back the strong side pegging when liquidity is used up, analysts have said.

Overnight excess liquidity spiked to almost 200 billion rupees in late May.

Excess liquidity is now down but the central bank is injecting some money overnight. Seven-day term money was injected below the overnight rate. At the moment private credit is still muted.

Due to deeply flawed operational frameworks, build on statistics rejecting classical economic principles and laws of nature, currencies of IMF dependend countries tend to depreciate permanently, nominal interest rates and inflation tend to be high, critics say.
