Independent commissions inefficient due to appointment of retired officers - Minister

Minister of Education Susil Premajayantha says the recruitment of 54 principals for national schools has been on hold for months now due to the inefficiency of the Public Service Commission.

Premajayantha pointed out that as a result of appointing retired individuals to the independent commissions, these institutions have become ineffective.

“We have been trying for 06 months now. I also remind commission of the matter every week. The Public Service Commission has not given approval to issue the gazette [to recruit principals]”, the minister mentioned.

Emphasizing that there is no point in establishing independent commissions if retired officers are appointed to run them, the minister also revealed his intention to bring the matter up during the parliamentary session soon.
