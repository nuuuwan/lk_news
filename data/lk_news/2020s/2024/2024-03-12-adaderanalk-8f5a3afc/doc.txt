The Cabinet of Ministers has given approval to sign documents with the Japanese government to receive a grant of Yen 1.6 billion (approximately Rs. 3.3 billion) under the Japanese Economic and Social Development Program for the implementation of several projects.

Japan has expanded its corporation to provide Sri Lanka with immediate humanitarian grants for the communities devastated by the present economic crisis and to empower the government sector to upgrade the economic situation of the country.

Accordingly, Sri Lanka’s long-time ally has agreed to grant Japanese Yen 1.6 billion to implement the following projects under the Japanese Economic and Social Development Program:

• Response and management enhancement project for oil spills of Sri Lanka Coastal Defense Force

• The project to supply assisting equipment for maternal and infant treatments in the main hospitals of the Northern province and the project to distribute assisting equipment for garment courses in vocational training centres of the Northern province

• The project to award assisting equipment for the security of fishermen in Northern and Eastern provinces

Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers green-lighted the proposal furnished by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies, to sign the exchange papers and other relevant documents with Japan to receive donation grants under the Japanese Economic and Social Development Program to kick off the aforementioned projects.
