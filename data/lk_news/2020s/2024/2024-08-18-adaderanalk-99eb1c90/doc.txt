Sajith Premadasa promises to recover country’s economy through foreign aid

Samagi Jana Balawegaya’s (SJB) presidential candidate Sajith Premadasa says that he will be initiating a recovery program for the country’s economy with the help of foreign aid after his presidential election victory.

Speaking at a public rally in Bandaragama, he highlighted that true development means the welfare and development of the people.

“For us, the development means the development of 2.2 million people in this country, not just statistics”, said Premadasa.

He further criticized the current government for its focus on personal gains while neglecting the needs of 22 million citizens who are struggling.

“As the election approaches, they make misleading promises, attempting to deceive the populace. It is not impossible to deceive the people of the country at the moment”, he added.

“Support us in creating a new era of development for everyone. We are committed to addressing and resolving the country’s issues with the help of foreign aid”, he said.
