Eight Sri Lankans rescued from Myanmar cyber slave camps repatriated

The eight Sri Lankans, including 2 females who were rescued from the cyber scamming camps in Myawaddy area of Myanmar have arrived in Sri Lanka this morning after being repatriated with the help of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Out of the 56 Sri Lankans who were trapped in cybercrime camps in Myawaddy, eight were rescued by the Myanmar government authorities in early March and sent to the Myawaddy central police station, following which they safely arrived at the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Thailand on April 11.

The International Organization for Migration provided logistical assistance in repatriating the rescued Sri Lankans. The Sri Lankan Embassy in Myanmar, through the Eden Foundation, a charity organization based in Myanmar, provided them with food and other necessities during their temporary stay at the Myawaddy Police Station following the rescue from traffickers.

The Consular Affairs Division of the Ministry coordinated the repatriation process in collaboration with relevant stakeholders, and Director General/Consular Affairs of the Foreign Ministry A.S.K Senavirthne received the eight Sri Lankans at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA).

The eight Sri Lankans expressed their deep appreciation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for its persistent efforts in ensuring their safe return to Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.

Issuing a statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also expressed its sincere appreciation to the Governments of Myanmar and Thailand as well as other stakeholders, including IOM for their assistance in this regard.

In December 2023, media reports shed light on the plight of a group of nearly 60 Sri Lankans, who were lured with tourist visas behind the false front of lucrative IT sector job offers and are being held captive in Myanmar by a notorious ethnic armed group.

It was understood that they had been duped into applying to job vacancies in Dubai by a certain agent in UAE, only to be trafficked into Myanmar for cyber slavery in Myawaddy where they were forced to commit internet scams.

According to harrowing statements given by the captives, they had been forced to appear as romantic partners to foreigners in order to steal their money. In the event they refuse to do as told, the captives had been subjected to acts of torture, which they said included electrocution, waterboarding in cages, hanging them by their hands and starving.
