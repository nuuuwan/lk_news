Partnering for success: Kingslake and Omega Line’s path to manufacturing excellence

Since its inception in 1999, the relationship between Kingslake and Omega Line has surpassed conventional bounds of business collaboration. Over the course of two decades, Kingslake has been a driving force behind Omega Line’s technological transformation, propelling them to the forefront of the apparel manufacturing industry.

From the very beginning, Kingslake’s solutions became an integral part of Omega Line’s operations. The foundation of this enduring partnership was laid with the implementation of Payroll system EazyPay, a product that streamlined employee management. Seamlessly intertwined with this was the financial arm, expertly managed through Infor Syteline ERP. This ERP solution not only facilitated financial management but also laid the groundwork for a cohesive and efficient business ecosystem. Additionally, the implementation of STYLEman, a Style colour size fit matrix, further enhanced Omega Line’s operational capabilities.

The relationship further strengthened as Kingslake implemented Syncrona, a revolutionary innovation that optimized fabric cutting processes and dramatically minimized material waste. This innovative solution not only saved resources but also positioned Omega Line as an environmentally conscious industry leader.
