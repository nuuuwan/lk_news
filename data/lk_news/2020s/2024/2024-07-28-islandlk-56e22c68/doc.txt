Centenary of the Berlin Viharaya

Germans came to know about the Buddhism, when they travelled to Kalmyki region of Russia in 17th century, from the Nomadic people from Mongolia who settled there.

Anton Walter Florus Gueth (1878 – 1957), a German who had travelled to Burma in 1904 ordained as the first German monk and came to Sri Lanka as Ven. Nyanatiloka thero and lived at the Polgasduwa Hermitage. He has written and published several book in Germany. Hermann Hess, Nobel Prize winner (1877 – 1962) has published ‘Sidhartha’ in 1922, which was a great value to German Buddhism.

Dr. Paul Dahlke (25 Jan. 1865 – 29 Feb. 1928) was a German physician and one of the pioneers of Buddhism in Germany. Dahlke was born in East Prussia as the son of a civil servant. He completed the Gymnasium (high school) in 1883 and proceeded to study medicine in Berlin. He received his MD degree in August 1887 and soon took over a Homeopathic medical practice.

In 1898 he started a journey around the world and was fascinated by the South Pacific. He also stopped over in Ceylon, where he encountered Buddhism. He had read about Buddhism when he studied Schopenhauer. Two years later he went on his second journey, this time specifically to Ceylon to learn more about Buddhism.

He learned Pali and met local Sinhala Buddhist monks, among them Ven. Hikkaduwe Sumangala, Ven. Suriyagoda Sumangala, Ven. Nyananissara and Ven. Wagiswara Theros. He returned a Buddhist and in the following years made several more journeys to Asia primarily to Ceylon, but also to China, India, Burma, Thailand and Indonesia. When the first World War started he was in Germany and was unable to travel to Ceylon as he had planned.

Dahlke had realized that studying and writing on Buddhism alone was not enough. He therefore decided to found a Buddhist Community right in the heart of Germany. Acquiring an extent of 11 acres land in the Berlin suburb of Frohnau in 1919, he proceeded to construct ‘Das Buddhistische Haus’ which he completed in 1924.

It was his intention that the property should be a Buddhist center. Besides the house proper, containing living quarters and library, a meeting hall was built close by, and separate rooms and cells for accommodating guests. Therefore, it was to be a midway solution between a monastery and layman’s habitation.

Before long Dr. Dahlke had a group of disciples around him prepared to live according to the Dhamma, and the Buddhist House soon become the center of German Buddhism. Anagarika Dharmapala, a good friend of Dr. Paul Dahlke, spent 10 days in the Buddhist House on his way to England in 1925.

Dr. Dahlke’s Buddhist group in Frohnau, Berlin had another strong link in Sri Lanka. The International Buddhist Union (IBU -Jatyantara Bauddha Samagama) with it’s headquarters in the island Hermitage (Polgasduwa Tapasarama) in Sri Lanka, which was under the leadership of the German born monk Ven. Nyanatiloka Maha Nayaka Thera. The Island Hermitage was a little island on the Ratgama Lake near Dodanduwa, that gradually became the home of a small band of European and Asian Buddhist monks.

One of the principal tasks of the IBU. was publishing and distributing Buddhist literature punished at Buddhist Publishing House “Benares Verlag”, Muenchen – Neubiberg, Germany.

At Das Buddhistische Haus, Dr. Dahlke was instrumental in publishing two Buddhist periodicals namely ‘Neu Buddhist’ and ‘Brockensammlung’ or ‘Scrap collection’. He has authored Buddhist books namely, ‘Buddhism Essays (1903)’ ‘Buddhism and Science’, ‘Buddhism and it’s place in the Mental Life of Mankind (1924)’ ‘Buddhism as a Doctrine of Actuality and way of Life’.

Dr. Dahlke died on February 29, 1928. With his death the Buddhistische Haus ceased to be a center for the Theravada Buddhist activities. His work was continued in a small house called ‘Holzhaus’ close to the premises of the Das Buddhistische Haus, built by Dr. Kurt Fischer, Dahlke’s secretary and editor of the magazine ‘’Buddhist Life and Thought’.

The Buddhistische Haus was in the hands of Dr. Dahlke’s sister, Bartha Dahlke from 1929 – 1944. She was the first disciple of Paul Dahlke having embraced Buddhism in 1914.

After the flight of Rudolf Hess to England in May 1941, the Nazi German Government (1933 – 1945) began to frown on Buddhist activities. DBH later became a center for war refugees towards the closing stages of WW2. Bartha Dahlke left DBH in 1944 for the island of Sylt in Denmark and died in 1947. In 1942 the Gestapo police summoned several Buddhist groups and publishers of Buddhist literature for interrogation. Among them was Dr. Kurt Fischer, secretary of Dr. Dahlke, who died soon after receiving Gestapo summons.

Dr. Wolfang Schumacher, Herr Guido Auster, Dr. Helmuth Klar and other prominent German Buddhists thereafter continued Herr Fischer’s activities. Some of the German Buddhist groups had continued to hold meetings in secret during the latter stages of the war.

Two businessmen, Asoka Weeraratna and his elder brother Dharmasena, re-located their family jewellery business from Galle to Maradana in Colombo in 1948. They also imported Swiss watches. Asoka made a number of business trips to Europe in 1950’s to import Swiss watches such as Paul Buhre, Boilat, Henry Sandoz, Roamer, Enicar and the German pen, Reform. They were the leading importers of Swiss watches to Sri Lanka.

In 1951 Asoka Weeraratna undertook his first business visit to West Germarny, meeting many people who had lost their families, wealth and possessions. This left a deep impression in him. In post-war Germany, the widespread sentiment was one of desperation and resignation – ‘kaput, kaput, alles kaput‘ (finished, finished, all is finished). He recognized the growing thirst for an alternative moral and spiritual philosophy.

On his return from West Germany, convinced of the potential for growth of Buddhism in that country, Weeraratna founded the ‘Lanka Dammaduta Society’ on September 21, 1952, and worked more or less in the back room of his family shop, P. J. Weeraratna and Sons at 592, Second Division, Maradana. This Society was later re-named ‘German Dharmaduta Society’ (GDS) on May 8, 1957.

Venerable Nanatiloka Maha thera, the well known German scholar monk was the first patron of the society.

A temporary training centre for Dharmaduta work opened at No. 145, Kandy Road, Dalugama, Kelaniya. The German monk, Venerable Nyanaponika Thera and several other Bhikkhus were given accommodation there.

In 1954, the Society launched a ‘Million Rupee Trust Fund’ for the permanent establishment of the Buddha Sasana in Germany. The Fund was inaugurated at a public meeting held at the Colombo Town Hall on September 6, 1954, presided by Mr. Dudley Senanayake, the former prime minister. The Government declared the Million Rupee Fund an approved charity. Walther Schmits, a German Buddhist, left DM 550,000 to the society upon his death in 1957.

In November 1955 the Government granted to the society an acre of vacant crown land at No. 417, Bullers Road, (Buddhaloka Mawatha) Colombo on a 99-year lease to construct new headquarters of the Lanka Dharmaduta Society. The foundation stone was laid on December 9, 1955 by Mr. Dudley Senanayake. On August 7, 1956, Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike declared open at a public meeting the new headquarters of GDS, consisting of a two storey dormitory with 14 rooms, an Assembly Hall, Office and Library built at a cost of Rs. 125,000.

The society sponsored the first Buddhist Mission to Germany, which left the Colombo Harbour by ship ‘SS Orantes’ on June 16, 1957. The three monks in this mission comprised Venerable Soma, Venerable Kheminda, Venerable Vinta of the Vajiraramaya Temple, Bambalapitiya. Mr. Asoka Weeraratna joined the mission in Berlin having flown from Colombo. Once the mission landed at Berlin the bhikkus reached Das Buddhistische Haus and stayed there.

By then Asoka Weeraratna had a thought of buying the Buddhist House. He negotiated with the nephew of the late Dr. Paul Dahlke, who lived in an island called Sylt near Denmark, in the extreme north of West Germany, 500 km from Berlin, He bought the property on December 13, 1957 for DM 174,370 (Rs. 318,016) on behalf of the GDS. Five trustees, Dudley Senanayake, Henry Amarasuriya, Dr. P. B. Fernando, Proctor Nelson Soysa and Asoka Weeraratne were appointed. The acquisition was completed on April 12, 1961.

Today Buddhist House is the oldest Theravada Buddhist Centre in Europe. It has been designated as a National Heritage Site since 1995 recognized by the German local authorities.

In 1964 Asoka Weeraratna acquired 500 acres from the Mitirigala Mukalana, a forest reserve, from the Government of Sri Lanka on a 99-year lease. With his personal funds and with the help of others who had volunteered to build ‘kutis’, he began the construction of the Mitirigala Forest Hermitage. Within a period of three years the reserve was transformed into a hermitage, which included ‘bhavana salawa’ (meditation center), ‘sakman malus’ and ‘kutis’.

On July 13, 1967 Ven. Nanarama Maha Thera arrived at the Nissarana Vanaya, accompanied by few monks to commence their residence there. The meditation program commenced on July 22, 1967.

On August 22, 1972, Asoka Weeraratna was ordained as a resident monk at the Nissarana Vanaya Aranya under the name, ‘Mitirigala Dhammanisanthi Thero’. He spent 27 years at the Nissarana Vanaya and passed away on July 2, 1999, at the age of eighty years.

Venerable Mitirigala Dhammanisanthi Thero (Asoka Weeraratna) is destined to be ranked in history as one of the preeminent figures of Sri Lanka’s post-independence Buddhist renaissance.

Berlin Viharaya celebrates it’s centenary in 2024. There will be a seminar conducted at the Berlin Viharaya on August 3 and 4. Tissa Weeraratna the nephew of Asoka Weeraratna is the present caretaker of the Berlin temple. The present resident monk of the temple is Ven. Palane Dhammakusala Thero.
