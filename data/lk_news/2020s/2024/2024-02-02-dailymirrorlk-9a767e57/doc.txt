SJB to bring in second No Faith motion against Keheliya

Colombo, Feb 2 (Daily Mirror) - The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) is to bring in another No Confidence motion against Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, Member of Parliament Kavinda Jayawardene said today.

“Our party decided to bring in a second No Faith motion against Minister Rambukwella some weeks ago, but we did not collect signatures as we knew President Ranil Wickremesinghe was going to prorogue Parliament. However, we will start collecting signatures from MPs for the No Confidence motion from February 7 when the House convenes,” MP Jayawardene said.

“We will publish the signatures we get for the motion this time so that the public will know who will go against corruption,” he added.

The MP alleged that the Minister’s involvement in the Human Immunoglobulin scam is becoming clear with the information that is being disclosed before the judiciary.
