Pidurutalagala must be reopened for tourists

Nuwara Eliya, Feb 13 (Daily Mirror) - Arrangements must be made to reopen Pidurutalagala, which is the highest peak in the island, for tourists, Central Province Governor Lalith U. Gamage said at the Nuwara Eliya District Coordinating Committee meeting.

"The Pidurutalagala mountain area in the Nuwara Eliya district, which is the highest on the island and has zero degrees, should be reopened for tourists," he said.

The Piduruthalagala mountain area has high educational and tourism value, and it is inappropriate to continue to maintain it as a prohibited area for the people, he added.

"Local and foreign tourists also like to observe the sunrise from the Nuwara Eliya tourist zones, so an opportunity should be given for that too, and there is an urgent need to open the places with high tourist attraction to the public under suitable methods and to establish appropriate tourism industries related to it," the Governor added.
