Police to trace traffic offenders in Colombo using CCTV system from next week

In a bid to curb traffic violations, Sri Lanka Police has decided to trace traffic offenders in Colombo using the surveillance camera system in the islandâ€™s commercial capital.

Speaking to the media this morning, Acting Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon said this initiative would be implemented starting next Monday (Jan.22).

Accordingly, the traffic fine sheet and the respective CCTV footage will be sent to the police station closest to the registered owner of the vehicle involved, the Acting IGP explained.

The decision was taken after observing that a substantial number of traffic rule violations had gone unnoticed by the police officers on duty where surveillance cameras are set up in Colombo, Tennakoon added.
