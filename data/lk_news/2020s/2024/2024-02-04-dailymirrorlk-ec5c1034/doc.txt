Protest in Jaffna against Independence Day celebrations, five arrested

Jaffna, Feb. 04 (Daily Mirror)- Police fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse a group of Jaffna University students and political leaders of the North, who staged a protest in Iranamadu, Kilinochchi calling the Independence Day a 'black day'.

Five university students were taken into police custody during the protest for unruly behaviour.

The protesters claimed that there is no proper situation in the country to celebrate Independence Day due to various reasons such as restrictions to media freedom and enacting Acts restricting freedom of speech.

Ilankai Thamil Arasu Kachchi leader S. Sridharan, Parliamentarian Charles Nirmalanathan and civil activists participated in this protest.
