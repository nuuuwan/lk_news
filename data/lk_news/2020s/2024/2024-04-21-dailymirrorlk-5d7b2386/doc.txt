People have already selected Ranil for Presidency: Prasanna

Colombo, April 21 (Daily Mirror)- Claiming that people will not vote as a gratitude for goods distributed by politicians, Minister Prasanna Ranatunge said people have already selected Ranil Wickremesinghe for Presidency as he can rescue the country from the economic crisis.

The Minister said this to the media after an event to distribute rice to low income families in Kelaniya.

Responding to a question, he said they were not distributing rice targeting elections and added that people who hold different political ideologies benefit from this programme.

"We are not doing this targeting elections. People who hold different political ideologies are here. People will not vote even though goods are distributed. People have already selected Ranil Wickremesinghe. That is because he can rescue the country from the economic crisis," he said.
