Seven-member committee to decide on Grade 5 Scholarship Exam

The Ministry of Education has taken steps to appoint a seven-member committee to decide whether or not this year’s Grade 5 Scholarship Examination should be re-conducted.

Ministry Secretary Thilaka Jayasundara said that this decision was taken on the advice of Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya.

A problematic situation arose due to the alleged leakage of some questions in this year’s Scholarship Examination, while the Examinations Department as well as the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) had launched investigations.

Education Ministry Secretary Thilaka Jayasundara added that the relevant committee will decide whether to conduct the examination again or not after considering the outcome of those investigations.
