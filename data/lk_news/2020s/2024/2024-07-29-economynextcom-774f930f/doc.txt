Sri Lanka seeks ASEAN cooperation on cyber job rackets

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s State Minister of Foreign Affairs has called for decisive action against cybercrime centres and employment rackets taking place in some parts of the Asia-Pacific region at a regional forum.

Speaking at the 31st Ministerial Meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum held in Laos on July 27, Tharaka Balasuriya called for the Asia Pacific region “to concertedly address emerging challenges including security-related aspects of new and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, with a view to taking preventive measures against their misuse.”

“In addition to sustaining the Asia-Pacific region’s efforts to promote peace, security, and cooperation, the Forum must address challenges to cyber and network security systems and tackle transnational organized crime,” Balasuriya  was quoted as saying in a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

He “called for decisive action against cybercrime centres and employment rackets taking place in some parts of the region.”

During and after the country’s economic crisis several Sri Lankans travelled abroad on visit visas to find employment. Some groups fell prey to trafficking.

A group of Sri Lankans held in Myanmar were repatriated earlier this year with the help of the International Organization for Migration providing logistical assistance.

This year’s ARF Ministerial meeting attended by 27 ARF members, was chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Saleumxay Kommasith of Lao PDR, which holds the ASEAN Chairmanship.

Balasuriya proposed that ARF also initiates climate justice programs, establish stronger regional mechanisms for disaster relief and response as well as collaborate more intensely to address climate and environmental challenges.

The State Minister met with delegations from the Philippines, China, European Union, Russia, Bangladesh, Papua New Guinea and Laos, on the sidelines of the forum. (Colombo/Jul29/2024)
