’My name removed from speakers’ list’: Navin Dissanayake

Colombo, March 11 (Daily Mirror)- Former UNP National Organizer Navin Dissanayake said he did not participate in yesterday's meeting organized by his party as his name had been removed from the speaker's list.

"I politely excused myself from the official UNP meeting as I was promised a speech but later found out that my name had been deleted. I wonder who is making these decisions on behalf of Party Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe. I will stand by the party but a man’s dignity should not be compromised," Dissanayake said in his X message.
