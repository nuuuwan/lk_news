UNESCAP Technical Cooperation Highlights Report flags significant strides in its partnership with Sri Lanka

The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) launched the Technical Cooperation Highlights 2022-2023 Report on 24th April 2024. The 2022-2023 Edition offers a comprehensive account of the inspiring and enduring partnerships with its partner countries with special reference to Sri Lanka.

Following the successful co-hosting of the Fifth South Asia Forum on Sustainable Development in Colombo by the Sustainable Development Council (SDC) and UNESCAP in 2021, the Sustainable Development Council took a lead role in mobilizing technical and financial resources of UNESCAP to support its core functions as well as some key initiatives of its partner agencies including the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the Sustainable Finance Committee of the Office of the President etc to advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Sri Lanka.

This collaboration has progressed towards UNESCAP’s continued technical assistance in strengthening Sri Lanka’s SDG monitoring and evaluation capabilities including developing the Sri Lanka SDG Progress Dashboard, developing Sri Lanka’s first sovereign Green Bond Framework, capacity building of key stakeholders (both public and private sector) on sustainable finance instruments including thematic bonds, technical assistance on Debt for Nature/ Climate Swaps, formulation of the National Strategy to Promote Inclusive and Sustainable Businesses to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals in Sri Lanka (ISB Strategy), and Capacity Building of Women Entrepreneurs of Sri Lanka on enhancing business opportunities through Digital Tools.

UNESCAP also provided technical support in conducting Sri Lanka’s Second Voluntary National Review of SDG Implementation (the VNR) and capacity building key stakeholders through a twinning programme with Pakistan.

Further, important work has already commenced in developing a National Action Plan for integrated SDG Monitoring in Sri Lanka, a Multi-stakeholder Action Plan for Inclusive and Sustainable Business Capacity Development and Inclusive Business Accreditation System with UNESCAP’s support.

The visit of the Executive Secretary of UNESCAP to Sri Lanka hosted by the Sustainable Development Council in January this year and the successful launch of the National ISB Strategy marks a significant milestone of this partnership.

The recently launched Report highlights how UNESCAPs partnership with Sri Lanka created opportunities to gain access to innovative approaches to advance the SDGs in Sri Lanka addressing complex and interlinked challenges relating to sustainable development.
