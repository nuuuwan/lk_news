’Sajith playing childish game’: Anura says in Parliament

Parliament, June 4 (Daily Mirror)- NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake raised concerns in Parliament saying that Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa had raised the same question he was to raise in Parliament over the University non-academic staff, calling it a childish act by the Opposition Leader.

MP Dissanayake inquired from the Speaker as to how the same question he had submitted to the Opposition Leader's Office to be raised in parliament under Standing Order 27/2 was raised before him by the Opposition Leader.

Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardhane clarified the matter saying that two questions had been submitted to the Secretary General's Office by the Opposition Leader's Office, one question was handed over at 11.40 am to be raised by the Opposition Leader and another question was handed over at 12.10 pm to be raised by NPP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

MP Dissanayake inquired whether he could submit the question directly to the Secretary General of Parliament instead of going through the Opposition Leader's Office.

The Speaker said the MP could submit the question directly to the Secretary General if he desired.

MP Dissanayake said, "We usually send questions through the Opposition Leader's Office. If you give me permission, I will send it directly to the Secretary General. I think it would be better. This is a childish game. I feel pity on him," he said.
