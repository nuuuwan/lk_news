Prices of eggs to go up from today

The prices of eggs are slated to be increased, effective from today (12 Feb.), according to the All Ceylon Egg Tradersâ€™ Association.

Secretary of the Association Buddhika Weerasena attributed the decision to the increased costs of several other factors within the industry, including the distribution of eggs.

Accordingly, the wholesale price of an egg will increase to Rs. 58 from today, while the retail price is likely to go up to Rs. 63 per egg.
