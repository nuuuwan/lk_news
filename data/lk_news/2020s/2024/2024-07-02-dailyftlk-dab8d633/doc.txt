He was also the oldest serving Parliamentarian at the time of his demise. TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran in a press release said information relating to the final rites of the MP will be informed in due course.

Messages of condolence have also been pouring in from both local and international figures following the passing of R. Sampanthan.

Posting on X, TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran said Sampanthan was a bold and relentless voice. “He tirelessly demanded equal rights for Tamils, within a ‘united, undivided, indivisible’ country.
