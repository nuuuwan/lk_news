Sri Lanka’s mothers should avoid foreign employment: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Mothers of infants should avoid working abroad, Sri Lanka’s Minister of Women’s Affairs, Geetha Kumarasinghe, has said.

“A mother should stay with the child till the child is two years,” Kumarasinghe said. “To whom are they going to give the responsibility? To the grandparents? To the husband? No, it is the mother who does that. You have to look after the child.”

At an event for International Women’s Day last month, Kumarasinghe said she was in favor of requesting mothers with children under two to refrain from foreign employment.

However, Minister of Labor and Foreign Employment, Manusha Nanayakkara has rejected this recommendation.

“Parental responsibility belongs to both the mother and father,” Nanayakkara told EconomyNext. “Why should restrictions apply to mothers and not to fathers?”

However, Kumarasinghe was adamant that Sri Lankan ‘culture’ dictated that women were the sole provider of childcare, or unpaid care work.

“Our society from those days, mother is always home looking after the children and cooking,” Kumarasinghe said. “That is not their only duty; they also have to work but they must stay home with the babies and cook something in the morning.” (Colombo/Apr2/2024)
