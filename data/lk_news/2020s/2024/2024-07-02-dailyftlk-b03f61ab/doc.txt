EDB conducts seminar on ‘Smart Solutions for Agricultural and Aquacultural Exports’

The Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) recently hosted an insightful seminar titled ‘Smart Solutions for Agricultural and Aquacultural Exports’, together with smart solutions provider, E Gravity Solutions Ltd.

This proactive initiative saw over 45 participants from the agriculture and aquaculture industries attending this interactive seminar. It was aimed at educating agriculture and aquaculture exporters on the numerous benefits of integrating with smart agriculture and aquaculture technologies.

The seminar emphasised the significance of adopting these advanced solutions and provided valuable insights into a diverse range of devices and products designed to enhance productivity and sustainability in the agriculture and aquaculture sectors.

Participants immersed themselves in a comprehensive session which covered essential topics such as solar power systems adaptability for both on-grid and off-grid applications, efficient solar-powered water pump systems tailored for irrigation needs, and cutting-edge smart weather stations delivering real-time environmental data.

Further they explained innovations in smart soil moisture and nutrient control systems, alongside devices for monitoring humidity, temperature, and pH levels crucial for optimal agricultural conditions. The seminar delved into automated irrigation systems for efficient water management and energy-saving pump controls aimed at reducing operational costs. Furthermore, attendees gained knowledge on advanced technologies including remote plant monitoring systems, smart greenhouse solutions promoting precision farming practices, and CCTV systems enhancing farm security.

The seminar highlighted IoT-based monitoring systems for real-time farm status updates, AI-driven technologies for intelligent soil management, and drone-based fertiliser applications aimed at enhancing crop yields. Insights were also shared on farm management software applications, safe methods for perishable transportation, and transport data loggers ensuring quality control during transit.

The participants were made aware of specialised monitoring systems tailored for aquaculture farms to address the unique needs of the aquaculture sector.

The seminar concluded with an interactive Q and A session, providing participants with the opportunity to clarify doubts and deepen their understanding of the presented technologies.

This is the first program of its kind and EDB is hoping to expand this to other regions as well in the near future.
