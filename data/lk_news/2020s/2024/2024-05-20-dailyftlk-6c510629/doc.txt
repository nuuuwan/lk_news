SJB proposes new dates for debate with NPP

The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) proposed new dates for the two debates planned between the leaders and economic councils of the SJB and the National People’s Power (NPP) party in a letter to the NPP on Friday.

In the letter addressed to NPP Executive Council member Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa, SJB MP Nalin Bandara suggested holding the debate between the economic councils first. Accordingly, the SJB proposed that the NPP select a date between 27 and 31 May for this initial debate. Additionally, the SJB proposed that the NPP choose any date between 3 and 7 June for the subsequent debate between SJB leader Sajith Premadasa and NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake. Earlier Jayatissa had written to the SJB requesting the rival party to choose either 7, 9, 13 or 14 May to hold a public debate between the respective party leaders.  However, the SJB refused and said Premadasa is not prepared to take part in a public debate on dates arbitrarily decided on by the NPP. It has now proposed alternative dates for the political showdown. The NPP has however yet to respond to the SJB communique. The two parties have been going back and forth on planning the debate since early April.
