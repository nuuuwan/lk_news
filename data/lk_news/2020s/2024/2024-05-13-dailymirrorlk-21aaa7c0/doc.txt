Chamal defends MRâ€™s decision to construct airport, port, stadium in Hambantota

Parliament, May 13 (Daily Mirror)- Defending the allegations on former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's decisions to construct an international airport, habour and cricket stadium in the Hambantota District, SLPP MP Chamal Rajapaksa said the issue is not the constructions but the failure to develop them as business ventures.

The MP told Parliament that if these constructions were developed as business ventures, it would not be a big issue to bring in dollar revenue to the country.

He said this when Parliamentarian Lalith Ellawala raised a question regarding the construction of the Sooriyawewa cricket stadium in Hambantota.

"Those who supported Mahinda Rajapaksa when he constructed ports, airports and stadiums are now raising these questions. Is Hambantota District not suitable to have these constructions? The then Cabinet decided to construct stadiums covering the whole country," MP Rajapaksa said.

He said several places such as Hingurakgoda, Angunakolapelessa, Puttalam and Matugama were proposed to construct an international airport and said it was finally constructed in Hambantota.

"Ranil Wickremesinghe even laid a foundation stone to construct an airport in Kuda Oya. The issue is not the constructions. These places should be managed properly and developed as business entities. These places were destroyed after 2016 under the Maithripala Government. No one talks about that. A ship carrying about 3,000 to 4,000 tourists arrive at Hambantota port every week," he said.
