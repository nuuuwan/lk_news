Remove Daya Rathnayake from SJB or face consequences: SF tells Sajith

Colombo, Jan. 31 (Daily Mirror)- Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Sarath Fonseka yesterday urged SJB leaders Sajith Premadasa to remove former Army Commander Daya Ratnayake from the party claiming that party would have to face consequences otherwise.

He said most of the high ranking army officials who are partial to the SJB called him and expressed their disappointment over the appointment.

When asked what action he would take if Ratnayake was not removed, Fonseka said he would not leave the party but would have to work against the appointment.

Field Marshal Fonseka told journalists that others in the party are also frustrated about the way new comers are accommodated in the SJB.

"Even SJB General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara accepted that Daya Ratnayake is not a person whom the SJB should welcome.," he said.

" Some others in the party including Harsha De Silva, Eran Wickramaratne and Kabir Hashim had informed me that they are also disturbed with the decision of the party leader to accept people to the party, " he added.

" I don't personally agree with the working committee decision of the party to give a blank cheque to the party leader to welcome anyone of his choice to the party," he said.
