Election Commission informed of vacant MP seat in Parliament

The Secretary-General of Parliament has informed the Election Commission that a Parliamentary seat in the Ninth Parliament has become vacant from 08 May 2024, due to the cancellation of parliamentary seat of Member of Parliament Diana Gamage.

In a press release, the Communication Department of Parliament said this was formally conveyed to the Chairman of the Election Commission in writing, pursuant to Section 64(1) of Parliamentary Elections Act No.01 of 1981.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday (May 08) declared that State Minister Diana Gamage is not legally qualified to hold a parliamentary seat.

Accordingly, delivering its verdict, the three-judge Supreme Court bench decided that Gamage is not eligible to hold the position of Member of Parliament as she holds dual citizenship.

Meanwhile, former Member of Parliament Mujibur Rahman of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) is to be nominated to fill the vacant parliamentary seat, according to Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa.
