Kamindu Mendis slams 4th Test century, equals world Test record

Sri Lankan batsman Kamindu Mendis scored his 4th Test Century while playing against New Zealand in the 1st Test at Galle, and he also equaled a world Test record by scoring 50+ runs in each of his first seven matches.

He has also broken Michael Vandort’s record for fastest Sri Lankan batter to reach 4 Tests hundreds, in just 11 innings, thus equaling Don Bradman’s record.

Mendis has joined an elite club, equalling a world Test record by becoming only the second batter to score 50-plus runs in each of his first seven Test matches.

Pakistan’s Saud Shakeel is the only other cricketer to have achieved this remarkable feat.

Mendis reached this milestone during the first day of the opening Test against New Zealand in Galle, scoring his eighth 50-plus in Tests.

His achievement surpasses cricketing greats like Sunil Gavaskar (India), Saeed Ahmed (Pakistan), and Basil Butcher (West Indies), who all managed fifties in each of their first six Test matches.

This record follows Kamindu’s impressive series against England, where he scored 113, 74, and 64 in a series of stellar performances.

After making his Test debut in 2022 against Australia with a solid 61, Mendis was sidelined for nearly two years but returned in 2024 with back-to-back centuries in Bangladesh.

In Galle, Mendis brought up his fifty off 73 balls and added a crucial 72-run partnership with Angelo Mathews.
