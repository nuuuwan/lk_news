Sri Lanka trying to help citizens hired by Russia-Ukraine mercenary firms: Foreign Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is trying to help citizens said to be working for mercenary companies linked to Russia and Ukraine, through diplomatic and non-diplomatic means, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ali Sabry said.

“We are trying to see what we can do where ever possible,” Sabry told reporters on Wednesday. “We can deal with the government of any other country.

“We are being asked to deal with a mercenary group which is not a formal government. It’s a very difficult task.”

Sri Lanka’s Foreign Ministry does not have data on the number of Sri Lankans fighting as mercenaries for Russia or Ukraine.

“We don’t know,” Minister Sabry told reporters. “None of them go through formal or official channels. They don’t register themselves either with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment or with the foreign ministry consular division or the Sri Lankan embassy.

Al-Jazeera news reported in March that at least two Sri Lankan ex-soldiers have been killed fighting for Russia and three fighting for Ukraine.

Some have claimed that they were hired for auxiliary services, but were then sent to the frontline.

Opposition legislator Dayasiri Jayasekera told parliament last month that he had information that ex-Sri Lanka soldiers were hired though India-based recruiters.

Mercenaries can earn high salaries in foreign exchange at a time when Sri Lanka is going through an economic crisis after trying to boost inflation and growth through aggressive macro-economic policy (rate cuts and tax cuts).

Minister Sabry said in his view they had “done a huge blunder and a mistake” by becoming mercenaries.

“But they are Sri Lankan citizens,” Sabry said. “We have a responsibility as a state to see the maximum we can do.” (Colombo/May8/2024)
