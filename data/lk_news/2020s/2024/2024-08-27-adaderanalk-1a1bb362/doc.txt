Tuberculosis on the rise in Kandy: 50 cases reported so far in 2024

The Chief Medical Officer of Kandy, Dr. Pasan Jayasinghe revealed that around 50 tuberculosis (TB) patients have been diagnosed within the Kandy city limits during the period which has elapsed so far this year.

Dr. Jayasinghe also highlighted that the most pressing infectious disease threat in Kandy is not dengue, but tuberculosis.

While dengue cases are typically identified within six days and the treatment can be commenced, tuberculosis presents a much greater challenge, as diagnosis of the disease can take up to six months, according to Dr. Jayasinghe.

Meanwhile, he highlighted that symptoms such as persistent coughing, weakness in body and the loss of appetite is significant in TB patients, but they often go untreated, as many individuals seek short-term remedies for these symptoms instead of undergoing proper screening for TB.

With tuberculosis cases on the rise in Kandy, Dr. Jayasinghe urged the public to be vigilant and prioritize their health.
