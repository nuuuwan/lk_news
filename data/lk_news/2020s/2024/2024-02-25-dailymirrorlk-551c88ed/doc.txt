Russian Embassy responds to controversial ‘white only’ party

The Russian Embassy in Colombo expressed serious concern over the recent controversial night party planned in Unawatuna on February 24, 2024, which was subsequently called off following public outcry.

In a statement, the Embassy said the event, which was organized by entrepreneurs in Unawatuna, was to be held with a "dress-code: white."

“While unconfirmed reports suggest that the main promoter and the owners of the bar agreeing to host the party are Russian citizens, it is essential to clarify that the event's cancellation was due to the ambiguous conditions of entry and the resulting confusion among the public,” it stated.

“The organizers have presented their apologies, acknowledging that there was no intention to cause harm or offense to anyone,” the statement added.

The Russian Embassy underscored Russia's firm condemnation of all forms of racial discrimination and nationalism. The Embassy reaffirms its commitment to combatting such atrocities.

In light of recent events, the Embassy emphasized the ongoing Special Military Operation conducted by the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine, aimed at eradicating manifestations of racial discrimination and nationalism.

Furthermore, the Embassy urges all Russian citizens visiting or residing on the island to adhere strictly to Sri Lankan laws and respect local customs.

The controversial 'white only' themed party scheduled to take place on February 24 at a Russian-run cafe in the south was cancelled by its organizers following widespread public backlash.

The event, which was promoted as an 'Opening White Party,' stirred significant controversy due to its discriminatory nature. Organizers intended to implement a face control policy where entry would be restricted solely to individuals deemed fitting by bouncers based on their white skin, wealth, style or demeanor.
