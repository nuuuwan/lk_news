Chandima Weerakkody endorses SJB as most suited destination for SLFPers

Claims SJB is most aligned with SLFP policies and ideologies as envisioned by party founder

Urges citizens to examine SJB’s proposals and compare it with those of other parties

Affirms SJB’s readiness to address issues faced by country’s citizens

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Chandima Weerakkody on Tuesday declared that the SJB is the most suitable political party for members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).

The MP addressing a press conference highlighted that SLFP founder S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike aimed to steer the party towards a moderate stance. Drawing parallels, he suggested that the SJB is currently following a similar path. Consequently, he maintained that the ideology most aligned with SLFP members is represented by the SJB.

Former SLFPer Weerakkody expressed his belief that the SLFP has undergone significant deterioration. He proposed that SLFP members might find it advantageous to consider joining the SJB, as its policies and ideology align more closely with their own.

While acknowledging that the rival Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) has gained some votes, he cautioned against basing politics solely on crowd support. Emphasising the importance of scrutinising politicians and understanding their proposed programs, he stressed the need to empower a political party capable of offering solutions to the country’s challenges.

He urged citizens to examine the proposals put forward by the SJB and compare them with those of other parties, advocating for voting in favour of a party that offers viable solutions. “When people make decisions in this manner, a brighter future awaits the country,” he asserted. He affirmed the SJB’s readiness to address the issues faced by the people.

Weerakkody criticised the current President and Government, accusing them of failing to fulfil their promises to the people and instead prioritising the interests of a select few. He said their actions are leading the country towards a downward spiral and endangering the democratic rights of the people. “The people anticipate a change,” he remarked.
