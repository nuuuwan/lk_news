24 Sri Lankans including artists arrested in Kuwait released

The 24 Sri Lankans including artists who were arrested in Kuwait on August 2 have been released.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the group had been released last night (03) following the intervention by the Sri Lankan Embassy in Kuwait.

The individuals including popular artists Indrachapa Liyanage, Samanalee Fonseka, ‘Jolly Seeya’ and Upeka Nirmani, were arrested by Kuwait Police while attending an event organised by the JVP-affiliated ‘Ethera Api’ organization.

Reportedly, they were arrested as proper permission had not been obtained for the organised event.

In addition to the artists, and organizers of the event, the music band as well as their musical instruments were also taken into custody by the police.

However, following the intervention of the Sri Lankan Embassy officials, 24 of these arrested persons were released last night while two of the organizing committee members remain in police custody, says the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
