Police Sergeant arrested while accepting Rs. 150,000 bribe near court

A Police Sergeant attached to the Mahabage Police Traffic Division has been arrested near the Mahabage Court for allegedly soliciting a bribe of Rs. 150,000 from an individual.

The police officer is accused of accepting the bribe on the pretext of not inconveniencing a resident of Uswetikeiyyawa over allegations of drug-related activities under the ‘Yukthiya’ police operation, to delete the latter’s name from such lists, and to refrain from searching his house.

The bribe was also requested in order to ensure that the individual in question could live peacefully without further trouble, according to the Bribery Commission.

The arrested suspect is scheduled to be produced before the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court.
