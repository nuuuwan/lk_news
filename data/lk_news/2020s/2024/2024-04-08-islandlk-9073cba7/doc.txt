P&S extends clean water initiative to rural communities under “Manu Mehewara”

Perera & Sons Bakers (Private) Limited (P&S), Sri Lanka’s largest and most-reputed quick service restaurant chain, has completed yet another inspiring initiative to uplift the living standards of rural communities. Reflecting its 120-year heritage of delighting Sri Lankans, and its strong commitment to corporate social responsibility, this time P&S extended a helping hand to the rural community of Pahala Konkadawala, Weerapokuna Village in the Kurunegala District. This resulted in yet another collaboration with the Sri Lanka Navy, to install and unveil a state-of-the-art Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant, ensuring access to clean and safe drinking water for the villagers.

Serving approximately 1,000 villagers daily, the RO plant now stands as a symbol hope, enhancing the daily wellbeing of the community. Spearheaded by P&S, this initiative marks a significant milestone in addressing the fundamental need for clean water in rural Sri Lanka. Conducted under P&S’s philanthropic arm, “Manu Mehewara”, this marks the fourth RO plant donation by P&S, following successful installations at institutions like the Trincomalee Base Hospital and Trincomalee District Hospital.
