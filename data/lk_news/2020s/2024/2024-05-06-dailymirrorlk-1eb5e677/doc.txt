Singapore to send team to study Sri Lankaâ€™s airport and immigration systems

Colombo, May 6 (Daily Mirror) - Public Security Minister Tiran Alles said today that the Singapore government has agreed to send a five-member team to Sri Lanka to conduct a comprehensive study of the country's airport and immigration systems.

Expressing the need for Sri Lanka's immigration services to evolve, the Minister said he has requested the Singapore government to assess and provide recommendations for enhancing Sri Lanka's airport and immigration systems to match Singapore's standards.

The Singapore government has agreed to send a team to Sri Lanka on May 27, he said.

"The team will assess our systems and submit a detailed report to us," Minister Alles said.

"We all know that Singapore has the best technology compared to Europe. We may not be able to implement those levels into our system immediately due to economic challenges. However, based on the report, we can adapt some technology that we can afford," the Minister told reporters in Colombo.
