Hill Country’s hideaway getaway: The Lavender House by Reveal the Collection

Amidst one of the most picturesque and oldest tea estates lies Sri Lanka’s hill country’s best-kept secret, The Lavender House by Reveal the Collection. The exquisite English-style bungalow in Pussellawa blends colonial charm with modern comfort and casts an enchanting spell entirely on its own.

The Lavender House, residing in the historically rich Hellbode tea estate, offers standout experiences like a delightful evening high tea in the estate’s gardens and an opportunity to observe and join the tea-plucking ladies. In 1854, Maurice Worms, who made history by introducing tea sampling sourced from China to Ceylon, planted the first tea plant in the Hellbode tea estate, which was then known as the Condegalla estate alongside the famous Rothschild estate.

The Lavender House offers premium accommodation with five beautifully designed rooms: Plum, Lilac, Violet, Magenta and the Lavender Suite. One can book a single room for an intimate getaway or can reserve the entire villa for a group of family or friends seeking a stress-free and detoxifying getaway experience. The bespoke hospitality of Reveal the Collection continues at The Lavender House with personalised butler service and specially curated culinary offerings from expert chefs.

The bungalow boasts a heated infinity pool overlooking misty mountains, a billiard room, a bar with the finest wine and brew and a unique Mirror Wall that contains signatures of the first owners, governors and estate’s senior planters from the colonial days. The living area with chestnut brown, grey and white colour blended aesthetic interiors and furniture features its lavish style.

The journey at The Lavender House extends beyond its walls. The lush landscapes of Pussellawa offer a playground for adventurers and a haven for those seeking tranquillity. Cascading down Pussellawa, the Gerandi Ella Waterfall remains a picturesque masterpiece—an exclusive secret shared only with the fortunate few. As part of the guest travel experience, The Lavender House orchestrates an exquisite breakfast picnic at the top of this waterfall upon request, tantalising your taste buds while treating your eyes to a view that feels almost surreal.
