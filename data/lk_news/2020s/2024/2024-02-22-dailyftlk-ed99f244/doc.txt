IPC Hand Soldering fundamental course and practical workshop on ESD and Electronic Assembly

A fundamental course on Hand Soldering and a practical workshop on ESD and Electronic Assembly was held on 13 February at the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa, in association with IPC India, Sri Lanka Export Development Board (SLEDB), and Sri Lanka Electronic Manufacturers and Exporters Association (SLEMEA).

IPC is a global organisation that supports Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS), Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacturers, Cable and Wire Harness Manufacturers and suppliers to the electronics industry. IPC members increase their bottom lines and deliver dependable, high-quality products through set standards, certification, education, training, thought leadership, advocacy, creative solutions, and industry knowledge.

Sixty participants from Sri Lankan electrical and electronic companies attended the interactive lectures and hands-on practical soldering workshop during the fundamental course. IPC awarded a valuable certificate to the participants who successfully completed the program. The participants gained deeper understanding on IPC standards’ requirements, assembly functionality, proper soldering techniques, assembly procedure adherence and overall product quality requirements. The hands-on soldering workshop gave the participants an opportunity to acquire good soldering techniques using cutting-edge tools.

The fundamental course comprised of the modules; Introduction and overview of Hand Soldering, safety and handling, Hand Soldering techniques (through hole), Hand Soldering techniques (Surface-Mount Technology-SMT), practical session, practical evaluation, technical workshop on Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) and presentations by Static Systems India Ltd. and Ray-Q Interconnection Technogym India Ltd.

This event provided a platform for professionals and industry experts to connect, share knowledge, and discuss latest trends and advancements in Electronic Assembly. The technical workshop on Electronic Assembly featured insightful sessions by industry leaders, covering topics such as emerging technologies, manufacturing processes, quality standards, and regulatory compliance.

IPC India Executive Director Gaurab Majumdar, Regional Manager South (Karnataka, Saudi Arabia, and Sri Lanka) Vittal Vatar, and Mater IPC Trainer B.J. Srinivas represented from IPC, Ray-Q Interconnection Technology India Ltd. CEO Prakash Rukmaiah, Static Systems India Ltd. Asst. General Manager – Sales Sudeesh Mani, SLEMEA President Dr. Ajith Pasqual, University of Moratuwa Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering Head of the Department Dr. Ranga Rodrigo, SIM Lanka CEO Gihan Jayasinghe, GPV group Learning and Development Manager Lalith Bandara, and SLEDB Deputy Director and University Academia D.A.D. De Zoysa were present at the event.

The event was significant for Sri Lanka’s electronics industry. The country’s electronics industry has grown steadily thanks to the initiatives and support from the Government, the skilled workforce and favourable business environment. Due to its advantageous geographic position and highly educated workforce, notably in engineering and technology, Sri Lanka has the potential to become a significant player in the global electronics market.

While continuing this endeavour, the SLEDB is planning to introduce short-term Hand Soldering courses for Vocational Educational Institutes in Sri Lanka with the help of IPC and SLEMEA in the near future.
