Colombo, March 28 - The Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court sentenced a police sergeant to four years' imprisonment for accepting a bribe of Rs. 500, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption said.

After a lengthy trial, Judge Prasanna Alwis found the accused guilty on all four counts.

As a result, the police sergeant was sentenced to four years' imprisonment and ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 20,000 (Rs. 5,000 for each charge).

In addition , the Rs. 500 bribe amount was ordered to be recovered as a penalty.
