SLPP’s condition to consider Ranil as presidential candidate

SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam says that if President Ranil Wickremesinghe resigns from the United National Party (UNP) and joins the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the party may consider him for the presidential candidacy.

He made this statement while speaking to the media following a discussion at the SLPP headquarters.

Kariyawasam stated, “Regarding the next presidential election, we have not presented a specific candidate yet. We will nominate the right candidate at the appropriate time, who will contest under the ‘floewer bud’ symbol.”

When asked if Wickremesinghe could be the common candidate, Kariyawasam responded, “A candidate of the SLPP will be put forward under the ‘flower bud’ symbol. If Wickremesinghe leaves the UNP and joins our party, we will consider his candidacy.”
