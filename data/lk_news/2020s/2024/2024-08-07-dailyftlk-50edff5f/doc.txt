Sri Lanka and France to establish Regional Centre for Maritime Studies

The Cabinet of Ministers at its meeting on Monday approved establishing a ‘Regional Centre for Maritime Studies’ through a bilateral agreement between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Government of France.

The French Government has identified Sri Lanka as the most suitable location for this centre, recognising the country’s proactive initiatives in maritime protection as a member of the Association of Indian Ocean countries.

The proposed centre will be set up at the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University, with additional support and infrastructure provided by the Trincomalee Naval and Maritime Academy.

This strategic placement leverages Sri Lanka’s geographic and academic strengths to foster regional maritime studies and collaborations.

“The centre aims to disseminate knowledge and coordinate actions based on joint studies, enhancing regional maritime security and cooperation,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said.

The proposal to this effect tabled by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as Defence Minister was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
