Mujibur Rahman tipped to fill Diana Gamage’s MP seat

Former Member of Parliament Mujibur Rahman of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) is nominated to fill the vacant parliamentary seat after the Supreme Court disqualified State Minister Diana Gamage from holding an MP seat.

Speaking during today’s parliamentary session, Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa announced that this decision will be communicated to the Election Commission.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday (May 08) declared that State Minister Diana Gamage is not legally qualified to hold a parliamentary seat.

Accordingly, delivering its verdict today, the three-judge Supreme Court bench decided that Gamage is not eligible to hold the position of Member of Parliament as she holds dual citizenship.

In January 2023, then SJB MP Mujibur Rahman decided to step down as a member of parliament in order to vie for the post of Mayor of Colombo in the now-postponed 2023 local government election.
