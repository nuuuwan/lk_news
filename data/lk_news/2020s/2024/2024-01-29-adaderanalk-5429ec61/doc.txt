The Department of Meteorology says showers will occur at times in Eastern and Uva provinces and in Polonnaruwa, Matale and Nuwara-Eliya districts.

Several spells of showers may occur in Anuradhapura, Mullaitivu and Hambantota districts, it said.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places in Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces and in Galle, Matara and Kandy districts after 2.00 p.m.

Fairly strong winds about 40 kmph can be expected at times over the Central, Uva and Northwestern provinces and Hambantota district.

The public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
