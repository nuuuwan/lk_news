President phones Dr. Yunus, pledges Sri Lanka’s support to Bangladesh’s recovery

In a telephone conversation, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has offered his warm congratulations to Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dr. Muhammad Yunus, who was recently sworn in as the head of Bangladesh’s interim government.

The President has also reportedly stated that he is confident that Dr. Yunus will be able to maintain law and order in Bangladesh.

President Wickremesinghe has informed the new Chief Adviser of the interim government of Bangladesh that he will request the Sri Lankan investors in Bangladesh to continue to stay there and carry on with investment activities.

The President has also pledged that Sri Lanka will provide assistance in every possible way for Bangladesh to develop economically.

Chief Adviser of Bangladesh’s interim government, who has expressed his gratitude for the Sri Lankan President’s greetings, has requested President Wickremesinghe to visit Bangladesh at the earliest opportunity and to provide the necessary guidance for the recovery of the country.

Muhammad Yunus, 84, is heading an interim government following the ousting of Bangladesh’s former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who resigned earlier this month and fled the country, and the dissolution of parliament.

Yunus is a social entrepreneur and banker who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his pioneering microfinance work that helped alleviate poverty in Bangladesh and was widely adopted around the world.
