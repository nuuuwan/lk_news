Marikkar warns Govt.’s current path will deter FDIs

Warns continued borrowing could lead to higher inflation, rising commodity prices, and escalating fuel costs in 2025

Asks President to not repeat promises on campaign trail and now deliver instead

Predicts NPP’s failure to deliver on promises would likely result in reduction in votes for NPP

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Colombo district candidate S.M. Marikkar has sharply criticised the current National People’s Power (NPP) Government’s handling of the country’s economy and its failure to meet the promises made to the public.

Addressing a press conference in Colombo yesterday, Marikkar argued that the Government’s current path would prevent foreign investors from coming to Sri Lanka, hinder production, and restrict the growth of exports. He warned that continued borrowing could lead to higher inflation, rising commodity prices, and escalating fuel costs in the coming year.

The SJB candidate questioned the claims made by the NPP, which had declared that corruption, fraud, and theft were rampant in Government institutions. He suggested that while these issues may have been highlighted, the NPP Government had failed to deliver tangible benefits to the people.  “If these issues have been addressed, why are the people not seeing the benefits?” Marikkar asked.

Marikkar also addressed President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s recent statements, in which he promised reductions in electricity bills and taxes. He reminded the public that similar promises were made during the Presidential election, but had yet to be realised.

“These promises should no longer be repeated; it is time for implementation,” Marikkar said, emphasising that the Government must act now to relieve the people’s burden.

He further criticised the Government’s stance that relief for the people could only be provided after the Parliamentary elections. Marikkar pointed out that the Government had already made decisions, such as imposing customs duties on food, without Parliamentary approval, undermining their argument that certain actions required Parliamentary power.

Looking ahead to the General Election, Marikkar predicted that the NPP’s failure to deliver on its promises would likely result in a reduction in votes for the party.  “The NPP Government has the ability to review its progress during the upcoming elections, but due to unmet promises, it is likely to face a decline in support,” he concluded.
