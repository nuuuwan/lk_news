Immediate investigation ordered into Maithripala’s claims on Easter attacks’ masterminds

Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles has ordered IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon to conduct an immediate investigation into the recent statement by former President Maithripala Sirisena on the Easter Sunday bomb attacks.

On Friday (22), former President Maithripala Sirisena claimed that he has knowledge of the true mastermind of the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks and that he was prepared to disclose the information to the judiciary if inquired from him or issues an order regarding the matter.

Commenting to the media in Kandy, Sirisena highlighted that he is ready to disclose the relevant information and that at the same time, it is the responsibility of the judges to keep the information strictly confidential.

Meanwhile, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Parliamentarian Kavinda Jayawardena lodged a complaint with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) today (23), seeking an expeditious investigation into the former President’s controversial remarks.

The remarks also sparked controversy in the political arena and left the former President in hot water for willfully concealing crucial information about the heinous bombings that claimed the lives of more than 250 people.
