Russia envoy asked for list of Sri Lankans hired for Ukraine war, ashes of the dead

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has made several requests from the Russian Ambassador to Colombo, the Defense Secretary has said.

“One is that they provide us with a list of Sri Lankan war heroes (ranaviruvo) engaged in the war,” Kamal Gunaratne told reporters Wednesday. “Then a complete list of the dead, so we can inform their family that their war hero died in that war.”

Sri Lanka has also learnt that there are injured soldiers. “We asked that they repatriate the injured, so we can look after them in our Army Hospital.”

“And finally we asked if they can repatriate the remains of the dead Sri Lankan war heroes, if we can get the ashes even, at least we can give that to their families,” he said.

Gunaratne said the ambassador had promised to look into the appeals.

The retired general also asked others who have not come forward yet to do so with details of those who have gone to fight in the Russia-Ukraine war. (Colombo/May15/2024)
