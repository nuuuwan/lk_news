IMF tax recommendations bring bourse down low

CSE activities were down yesterday due to new taxes having been recommended by the IMF, which would likely come into force after the November budget. Besides, negotiations with private creditors on the debt restructuring exercise are yet to commence, market analysts said.

However, the government expects to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with bilateral creditors on the debt restructuring exercise during the course of June as part of the IMF recommendations.

Due to political uncertainties market activities were dull coupled with the impact of short trading days this month. Amid those developments both indices moved downwards. The All Share Price Index went down by 50.25 points while S and P SL20 declined by 24.6 points. Turnover stood at Rs 1.85 billion with four crossings.

Those crossings were reported in HNB, which crossed on 1.1 million shares to the tune of Rs 220.50 million; its shares traded at Rs 200, JKH 1 million shares crossed for Rs 204 million; its shares traded at Rs 204, Hayleys Fabrics 1 million shares crossed to the tune of Rs 45 million; its shares traded at Rs 45 and Richard Pieris 1 million shares crossed for Rs 20 million; its shares traded at Rs 20.

In the retail market top seven companies that mainly contributed to the turnover were; JKH Rs 421 million (1 million shares traded), NTB Rs 140 million (1.04 million shares traded), HNB Rs 115 million (575,000 shares traded), JAT Holdings Rs 77.7 million (3.7 million shares traded), Hayleys Fabrics Rs 77.5 million (1.7 million shares traded), Renuka Hotel Rs 47 million (472,000 shares traded) and Hayleys Rs 37 million (356,000 shares traded). During the day 38.7 million share volumes changed hands in 10097 transactions.

Further, JAT Holdings added a new binding plant to increase its production capacity, creating some buying pressure for those stocks. Accordingly, its share price rose by five percent or Rs 1.10. Its last trading price was Rs 21.70 and at the end of the day it moved to Rs 21.70.
