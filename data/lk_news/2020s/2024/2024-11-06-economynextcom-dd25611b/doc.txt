Sri Lanka’s Adani-JKH terminal gets quay and yard cranes

ECONOMYNEXT – A container terminal built by India’s Adani group and John Keells Holdings in Colombo Port has received the first batch of quay and yard cranes, the project’s Sri Lanka partner has said.

“The construction and installation works on the West Container Terminal (WCT-1) at the Port of Colombo is progressing well,” Krishan Balendra, chairman of JKH told shareholders in an  interim report of the group.

“The first batch of quay and yard cranes arrived in September 2024, following which the commissioning is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2024/25.”

The first phase of the terminal will start operations in the fourth quarter of 2024/2025, he said.

JKH already runs South Asia Gateway Terminals, in Colombo Port.

“Profitability at SAGT recorded an increase driven by a growth in volumes and an improvement in the mix,” he said.

“Volume growth was on account of increases in both domestic and transshipment volumes.”

Lanka Marine Serivice, which sells bunkers also saw higher profits “on account of significant growth in volumes during the quarter on the back of increased demand from continued disruptions in the Red Sea, and higher margins.”

The Red Sea disruptions which forced ships to travel around Africa, has led to more containers being discharged in Colombo to be taken by feeders to several Middle Eastern ports. (Colombo/Nov05/2024)
