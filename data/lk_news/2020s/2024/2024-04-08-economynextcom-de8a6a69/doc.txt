Singapore inspects Sri Lanka poultry, seafood, rice processors ahead of exports

ECONOMYNEXT – A delegation from Singapore Food Agency (SFA), the competent authority responsible for food safety and security in the country, has visited Sri Lanka to inspect companies that wished to export foods to the country.

Sri Lanka’s Export Development Board said, Abdul Jalil Abdul Karder, Assistant Chief Executive Officer (Operations) of the FSA had arrived on March 25 to pre-inspect slaughterhouses following applications made by Sri Lanka firms to export poultry products.

“For Sri Lanka to export poultry products to Singapore, it is imperative for the country to meet the stringent requirements set out by the SFA,” EDB said.

“In this regard, facilitating this process, the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) organized additional visits for the SFA delegation to a rice processing mill, a fruit and vegetable processing center, as well as a seafood export company.

Applications for licenses from Sri Lankan poultry processing and export companies, facilitated by the Department of Animal Production and Health, are currently under evaluation, EDB said.

Samples from rice processing mills were submitted to the SFA for further assessment by potential clients.

The Singaporean team also held discussions with EDB Chairman Kingsley Bernard and representatives from the Sri Lanka Food Processors Association and the Sri Lanka Fruit and Vegetable Association. (Colombo/Apr08/2023)
