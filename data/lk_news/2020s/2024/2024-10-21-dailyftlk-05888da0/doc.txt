Gammanpila reminds President of deadline to release Easter attack reports

Says deadline given to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to release reports will lapse today morning

Claims it is Dissanayake’s constitutional responsibility to release reports, and failure to do so could lead to severe consequences

Notes he will release the reports if President fails to, even if it risks him being imprisoned

Claims similar to Imran Khan using AI to send messages while imprisoned, he will use same technology to release reports, even from behind bars

Former MP Udaya Gammanpila has issued a warning to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake regarding the release of two unpublished reports related to the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks.

Speaking at a press briefing yesterday, Gammanpila reminded Dissanayake that the deadline he had given the latter to release the reports will expire at 10 a.m. today.

“The time I have given the President to release the two reports regarding the Easter attacks, which he is hesitant to make public, ends at 10 a.m.,” Gammanpila declared. He emphasised that it is the President’s constitutional responsibility to release the reports, and failure to do so could lead to severe consequences, including impeachment.

Gammanpila cited Article 38 of the Constitution, warning that if the President continues to withhold the reports, he will take the bold step of making them public himself. He expressed willingness to face any legal repercussions, including potential imprisonment under the Prevention of Terrorism Act or the State Secrets Act, which could result in a 14-year prison sentence. However, Gammanpila emphasised that he is prepared to take this risk for the sake of transparency and justice.

Referencing Pakistan’s Imran Khan, Gammanpila vowed to use technology to communicate from prison, should he be arrested. “Similar to Imran Khan using AI to send messages while imprisoned, I will use the same technology to release the reports, even from behind bars,” he said.

Meanwhile, Upul Kumarapperuma PC, a member of the NPP Lawyer Collective and a NPP Matara district electoral candidate, has cautioned Gammanpila about the legal ramifications of his actions. Kumarapperuma explained that publishing State secrets is a criminal offence, and if the reports Gammanpila intends to release are classified under the law, it could have serious consequences.

“There are several reports related to the Easter attacks, including the Presidential Commission report and the Parliamentary Select Committee report. A Presidential Commission report cannot be made public for 30 years, according to the law, and can only be accessed by the President,” Kumarapperuma said. He warned that if Gammanpila releases a report classified as a State secret, it would constitute a criminal offence and urged him to proceed with caution.
