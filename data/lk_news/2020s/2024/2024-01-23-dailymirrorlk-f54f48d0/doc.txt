No funds, DAT allowance suspended for doctors

Colombo, Jan 23 (Daily Mirror) - Â The Health Ministry has decided to suspend the provision of the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance which was increased from Rs. 35,000.

The Ministry said despite the earlier announcement that the allowance for doctors will be raised to Rs. 70,000, the increased amount of Rs 35,000 will be suspended as per the directive of the Treasury.

The government recently approved the President's proposal to double the DAT allowance up to Rs. 70,000 for doctors.
