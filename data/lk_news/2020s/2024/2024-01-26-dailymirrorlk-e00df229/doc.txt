Also, she was assured that necessary arrangements would be carried out to allow her to continue her work without any trouble.

In return, the accountant of the hotel allegedly brought her to a room in a private hotel in Habarana for sexual intercourse.

QBribery Commission officials arrested the suspect and he is to be produced before the Kekirawa Magistrate's Court.
