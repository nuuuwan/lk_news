High emigration rate of Sri Lanka medical professionals: President

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said the significant emigration rate among trained medical professionals of the country was concerning.

“Approximately 30 to 40 out of every 100 doctors or nurses trained in the country opt to leave, a circumstance unfavourable for the nation,” Wickremesinghe was quoted as saying by his media division at a ceremony to open the improved Accident and Emergency Unit at the Point Pedro Base hospital.

A collective effort was needed to enhance healthcare services, he said, adding that he had instructed the Sir John Kotalawala Defence University to augment its recruitment efforts to fulfil the requirements in medical and nursing fields.

The Cabinet this week approved establishing a Faculty of Medicine at the National School of Business Management (NSBM) Green University, which doctors unions have opposed. Lyceum Campus has expressed interest in this endeavour, the president said.

It was important to integrate modern technology, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), into the healthcare sector of the country, he said.

The Point Pedro Base Hospital Development Project was initiated with a 4 billion rupee Dutch Government relief loan, as part of the Government of the Netherlands’ Development Related Infrastructure Investment Vehicle (DRIVE).

“Fostering equal rights for all Sri Lankans is integral to the reconciliation process, beginning with fundamental rights like access to healthcare and safety,” Bonnie Horbach, Ambassador of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to Sri Lanka, said at the event.

Point Pedro Base Hospital’s infrastructure including Accident and Emergency unit (A&E), Preliminary Care Unit (PCU), Radiology Development (X-Ray, Ultrasound Scanner and CT Scanner), Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Operation Theatres, Neonatal ICU, Premature Baby Care Unit (PBCU), Surgical Ward, Maternity Ward, Central Sterile Supply Division (CSSD)Dialysis Unit and Laboratory were improved.
