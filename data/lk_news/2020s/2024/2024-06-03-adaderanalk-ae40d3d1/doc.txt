Injunction against Minister Wijeyadasa extended further

The Colombo District Court has further extended the interim order issued preventing Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from functioning as Chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).

This order was issued when the relevant plaint was called before Colombo District Judge Sandun Withana this morning (03), who directed the plaint to Colombo Additional District Judge Chamari Weerasuriya.

Appearing for the respondents of the case, Attorney-at-Law Jayamuditha Jayasooriya requested additional time to file objections related to the case.

Accordingly, the case was ordered to be recalled on July 13, granting time for the relevant objections to be filed.
