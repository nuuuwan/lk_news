Phew! The heat…

The group Mirage, after a month’s stay in Australia, returned to the island on Tuesday, 12th March, and went into action that weekend at a popular venue, in Colombo.

Their trip Down Under was quite eventful; the band was involved in three gigs.

However, the crowd, at the group’s final performance, in Bentleigh, Melbourne, was confronted with a kind of a heat wave that made everyone feel uncomfortable.

Since the event was held from 12 noon to 4 pm the sun was scorching hot, according to reports coming my way, and that resulted in some of the original arrangements being disrupted.

However, music wise, it was an entertaining scene, with Mirage and Manilal doing the needful, along with Esric Jackson and the band No Limit.

Mirage opened their tour of Australia, in Melbourne, at the Valentine’s Day dinner dance, at the Grand on Princes.

Since the members of Mirage stayed with Sri Lankan families, while they were in Australia, they spent their free time enjoying what Melbourne has to offer tourists.
