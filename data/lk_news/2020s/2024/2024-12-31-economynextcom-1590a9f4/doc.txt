Sri Lanka to set up state investment review committee

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet of ministers has approved a proposal to set up a committee to decide on the implementation of investment projects, spokesman minister Nalinda Jayatissa said.

The state investment supervision and evaluation committee will consist of 11 members including two ministry secretaries.

“In the last decade, the government has not seen expected returns commensurate with the costs it incurred during investment projects, so targeted development didn’t take place,” Jayatissa told reporters.

“On the other hand, various problems affecting the implementation of development projects have arisen especially around project oversight and management.”

The committee will be able to make decisions related to the implementation of investment projects, planning, resource allocation, budgeting, finance, and monitoring based on information provided by Chief Enumeration Officers. (Colombo/Dec31/2024)
