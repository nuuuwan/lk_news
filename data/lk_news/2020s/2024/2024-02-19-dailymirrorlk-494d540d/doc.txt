Health Minister responds to reports on dearth of medical equipment

Colombo, Feb 19 (Daily Mirror) - Responding to the allegations on the acute shortage of critical medical equipment at government hospitals, Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana dismissed the claims.

Addressing the media, he stated that they had not received any reports of such cases from hospitals.

Nonetheless, the Minister said the Health Ministry will look into the matter further as there could be shortcomings.

Besides, he said there are no official reports of surgeries being halted due to the unavailability equipment as of now.

Health sector trade unions recently claimed that government hospitals are grappling with an acute shortage of critical medical equipment, including surgical equipment.

However, according to 'Swastha' which is the information management system of the availability of medicinal drugs, there is a significant shortage of stent items including esophageal stent, Double J stent, 3Fr etc.
