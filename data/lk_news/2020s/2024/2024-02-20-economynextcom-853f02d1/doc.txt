Sri Lanka Central Bank pay hike questioned in parliament

ECONOMYNEXT – Steep salary hikes said to have been given to central bank staff came under fire in parliament with the Chief Opposition whip questioning how such large increments were made.

“It says a 700,000 increment was given to a deputy governor and 75,000 to an office assistant,” Lakshman Kiriella questioned in parliament Tuesday.

“These are the people who say tighten your belts, reduce staff, taxes have to be raised,” Kiriella pointed out.

“It would be good if people are willing to work for less, but the fact is salary scales for these roles remain high around the world,” State Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

In the last three years “99 Central Bank employees, 10 percent of that grade, left the island,” Siyambalapitiya said, adding that “We have to try to retain economists of a high caliber.”

“What economic knowledge? These are the people who bankrupted the country’s economy!” Kiriella rebutted. (Colombo/Feb20/2024)
