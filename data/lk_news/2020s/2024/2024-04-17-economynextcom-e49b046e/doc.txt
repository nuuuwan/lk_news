Eyeing Green Bonds, Sri Lanka State FinMin takes part at WB Biodiversity Financing forum

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s State Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe took part in the World Bank’s Bio-Diversity Financing Forum on the sideline of the IMF/World Bank Spring Meeting in Washington late on Tuesday as the island nation is looking to borrow through nature-lined Green Bonds.

Sri Lanka’s Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) introduced listing of Green Bonds in April last year and officials say a few parties have expressed interests in listing. However, so far no listing has been done.

The money raised from Green Bonds, a nature-linked debt instrument, could be used only for green projects like renewable energy, unlike conventional corporate debenture, which could be used for anything the government wants.

The island nation has set targets to become carbon neutral in 2050 and is looking for $11.26 billion in investment to meet its renewable energy targets in eight years through 2030, government officials have said.

“Glad to make remarks at the Bio-Diversity Financing Forum held at the World Bank,” Semasinghe told in his X platform.

“Highlighted the country’s priorities and the way forward in accordance to the Climate Prosperity Plan launched at the COP 27.”

“It is the road map to attract foreign investment for boosting economic growth and employment generation of Sri Lanka, while accelerating climate adaptation and bringing down the country’s greenhouse gas emissions as it transitions towards net negative emissions.”

“Further, stated Sri Lanka has also set a target for increasing country’s renewable energy generation from 35% to 70% by 2030. Further, the transport, forestry, water and tourism sectors have similarly ambitious aims.”

“Therefore, the country’s plan provides a pathway for Sri Lanka to become a carbon negative economy before the mid of this century. Further noted that Sri Lanka has already initiated work on drafting a Marine Spatial Plan for which the work is already under way.”

Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe in December last year launched ambitious targets of establishing a International Climate Change University in Sri Lanka, Climate Justice Forum (CJF) and Tropical Belt Initiative (TBI) at the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) held in Dubai.

Sri Lanka is still recovering from an unprecedented economic crisis and has declared sovereign debt default in April 2022.

The island nation is unable to raise funds from the capital market as it has yet to finalize the debt restructuring deals and start repayment of the past external loans amid lower ratings by rating agencies. (Colombo/April 17/2024)
