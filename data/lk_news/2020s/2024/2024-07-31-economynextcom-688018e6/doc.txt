Sri Lanka has less than 10-pct female pilots, compared to India’s 40-pct: Official

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has fewer than 10 percent of female pilots, Chairman of Sri Lanka Airport and Engineering Services, Athula Galketiya, said.

“In Sri Lanka it’s less than 10 percent but in India you get around 30 percent or 40 percent,” Galketiya told reporters on Monday.

“In Sri Lanka, it’s very hard to get into the industry of piloting.”

Galketiya said that approximately 25 to 30 percent of Sri Lanka’s air traffic controllers are women.

The country has faced the resignation of air traffic controllers due to salary issues. Galketiya said 80 have left the country.

In response, the government has decided to recruit new Air Traffic Controllers. “So far, a team of over 25 has been recruited, trained, and assigned to duty. Additionally, applications for another group have already been called.”
