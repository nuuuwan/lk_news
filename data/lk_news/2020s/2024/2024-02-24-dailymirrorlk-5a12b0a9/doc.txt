Kegalle district gets new foreign employment bureau office

Kegalle, Feb 24 -Â Labour and Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara has addressed a joint request from the Kegalle Migrant Workers Committee and the Kegalle District political authority by committing to establish a Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) office in Kegalle District.

The decision comes in response to concerns raised about the absence of an SLBFE office in the district, despite it hosting the highest number of migrant workers in the Sabaragamuwa Province.

The announcement was made during the Jayagamu Sri Lanka program, organized by the Ministry of Labour and Foreign Employment in Kegalle, where the Committee presented their request.

They underscored the critical need for an SLBFE office to address the welfare and concerns of migrant workers from the region.
