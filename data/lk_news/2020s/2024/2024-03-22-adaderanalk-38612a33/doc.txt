AG will not represent ex-Health Minister Keheliya, court told

The Attorney General has informed the Supreme Court that he would not represent former Minister of Health Keheliya Rambukwella and several other respondents named in a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition.

The petition seeks a ruling determining that fundamental human rights have been violated through the decision taken to purchase medicines from two unregistered Indian companies under the Indian credit line.

Appearing on behalf of the Attorney General, the Deputy Solicitor General communicated the decision to the court when the relevant petition was taken up for consideration today (March 22).

Later, the Supreme Court also ordered that further consideration of the petition be adjourned.
