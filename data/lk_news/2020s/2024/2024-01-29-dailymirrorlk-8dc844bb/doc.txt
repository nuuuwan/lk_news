Oman air to stop flights to Colombo

Muscat, Jan 29 (Times of Oman) -  As part of its ongoing transformation, which aims to improve the company’s overall financial performance and fortify its position in an increasingly competitive market, Oman Air has announced several strategic changes to its network.

These include the addition of a new route, Sialkot, as well as the cancellation of operations to Islamabad, Lahore, Colombo and Chittagong. The airline will also be reducing frequencies to certain markets while increasing capacity to two current destinations (Lucknow and Thiruvananthapuram).

In addition, three destinations will be operated on a seasonal basis: Trabzon during the summer season, and Zurich and Malé during winter.

Oman Air has also introduced measures to optimise its schedule, starting this summer. To better cater to the Omani market and serve key flows in and out of Oman, flight times have been revised for several of its destinations, with emphasis on more favourable slots to offer greater convenience for direct passengers and maximise connection windows.

Meanwhile, the airline is continuously evaluating its strategy to adapt to changing market dynamics and identify additional opportunities. Maintaining alignment with government stakeholders including the Ministry of Heritage and Tourism, Oman Air remains committed to the economic and social objectives of Oman’s 2040 Vision.
