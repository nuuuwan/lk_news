Minister reveals Sri Lankaâ€™s first arrest under Online Safety Act

Panadura, Feb 11 (Daily Mirror) - Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles said the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has arrested an individual who had slandered on social media.

Addressing a programme to educate the community police committee members of the Panadura Division, the Minister said the particular individual had about Rs. 400,000 in his possession at the time of his arrest.

He added that the suspect had maliciously carried out smear campaigns with the support of a politician.

"A person was arrested by the CID. He is someone who slanders us online using social media. The suspect claimed that a politician gave money to him. He was arrested right after he went to Fort to exchange dollars to Sri Lankan rupees. They use social media to slander us, the government, the Acting IGP and everyone else," he said.

The Minister said the government brought the Online Safety Act to prevent such occurrences.

He mentioned that they use social media to even topple the government.

Minister Alles emphasized that the Online Safety Act will be an issue only for those who abuse social media.
