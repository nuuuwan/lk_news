‘We need international support to achieve desired transformation’: Anura Kumara

Katunayake, Feb. 10 (DEaily Mirror)- Claiming that Sri Lanka can no longer function as an isolated country, NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today their intention is to strengthen diplomatic ties to garner international support to achieve the desired transformation in the country.

Speaking to the media at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) on his return from India, he said India is an emerging country in the region and country expertise in the IT sector and that Sri Lanka can obtain support from them.

"We must stop the destructive political culture of 76-years. People have high expectations and are awakening to make that transformation. Our intention is to give leadership to this expectation and awakening to make a transformation in the country. We need international support for that transformation. We are not a developed country or a country with modern technology.

"We need capital and technology in some sectors. We also need to deal with some countries to expand our market. We can't achieve our targets by being an isolated country in the world. Therefore, our target is to strengthen our ties," he said.

Responding to a question, he said the NPP should not change its political or economic policies to visit a country or for diplomatic meetings.

"India is an emerging country in the region. We can obtain more support in sectors such as IT from India. We hope we can get support according to our own agenda and in line with our national plan," he said.
