Madagascan woman arrested with 75 swallowed cocaine capsules at BIA

The officers of the Narcotics Control Unit of Sri Lanka Customs have arrested a foreign national woman at the arrival terminal of the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) for attempting to smuggle cocaine capsules by ingesting them.

The arrested 38-year-old Madagascan woman is suspected to have swallowed about 75 cocaine capsules with an estimated street value of around Rs. 35 million.

The Madagascan had arrived at BIA onboard a Vistara Airlines flight on April 12 from Addis Ababa in Ethiopia via Mumbai, India.

The woman had ingested cocaine capsules enclosed in condoms, carefully sealing them with tape to avoid any potential leakage, Sri Lanka Customs said.

Following her arrest, the Madagascan has been admitted to Negombo Hospital for extracting the swallowed capsules of drugs.

After extracting the swallowed drug capsules from the suspectâ€™s body, she will be handed over to the Narcotics Control Unit of Sri Lanka Customs for further investigation.
