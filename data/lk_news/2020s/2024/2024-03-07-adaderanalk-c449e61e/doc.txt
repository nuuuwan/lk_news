CEB to introduce instalment payments for new electricity connections

Minister of Power & Energy Kanchana Wijesekera says the electricity consumers will be allowed to make the payments for their new connections on an instalment basis.

Addressing the parliamentary session earlier today (March 07), the lawmaker said the consumers will be able to pay 25% of the connection fee upfront and the remaining amount within 10 or 12 instalments.

The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is currently working on introducing this facility to the consumers and its Board of Directors has also green-lighted the endeavour, Wijesekera said further.
