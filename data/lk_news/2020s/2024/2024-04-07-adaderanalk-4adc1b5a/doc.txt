SLFP convenes urgent politburo meeting led by CBK

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has summoned the party’s politburo on Monday (March 08) to discuss the future course of action of the party, in view of its current internal crisis situation.

The meeting will reportedly be chaired by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.

On Thursday (04), the Colombo District Court issued an interim injunction preventing former President Maithripala Sirisena from functioning as the SLFP chairman, following a complaint filed by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.

Nevertheless, Sirisena has reacted, saying that he intends to present facts before the court regarding the matter.

Meanwhile, the Acting General Secretary of SLFP Dushmantha Mithrapala lodged a complaint with the Maradana Police on Friday (05), alleging that several ‘important’ files have gone missing from the party headquarters.

Thus, entering the SLFP headquarters in Darley Road, Colombo 10, has been prohibited for all individuals, due to the ongoing investigation into the relevant complaint.

However, the said politburo meeting will accordingly take place at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute.

It was reported that all party members excluding former President Maithripala Sirisena, former General Secretary Dayasiri Jayasekara and MP Shan Vijayalal de Silva have been invited for the relevant meeting.
