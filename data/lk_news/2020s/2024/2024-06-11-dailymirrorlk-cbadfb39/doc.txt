SA on brink of Super 8s with tense win over Bangladesh

New York, June 11 (BBC) - Heinrich Klaasen hit a vital 46 as South Africa claimed a nervy four-run victory over Bangladesh that put them on the brink of securing a place in the T20 World Cup Super 8s.

A combination of the pitch, poor shot selection and good bowling from Bangladesh saw South Africa teetering on 23-4 after they won the toss, as Tanzim Hasan Sakib snaffled 3-18.

Klaasen hit three fours and two sixes in his 44-ball innings as he shared a 79-run partnership with the dependable David Miller to help South Africa recover to compile a defendable 113-6.

Bangladesh made a decent fist of the run chase and at 94-4 with three overs remaining were probably slight favourites.

However, when Kagiso Rabada took the key wicket of Towhid Hridoy for 37 the momentum swung back to the Proteas.

Bangladesh required six off the final two balls and a sizable contingent of their fans momentarily thought they had done it when Mahmudullah heaved a Keshav Maharaj full toss down the ground, only for Aiden Markram to pouch a catch inches from the boundary.

Offered another chance with a full toss from Maharaj off the final ball of the match, Taskin Ahmed could only slice it for a single.

South Africa, who have won all nine of their T20 internationals against Bangladesh, are unbeaten in the tournament so far with three victories and top Group D.
