Bus fares to remain unchanged - NTC

The National Transport Commission (NTC) has announced that bus fares will not be increased, despite the recent revision in fuel prices.

Earlier today (01 Feb.), the private bus owners’ associations urged for immediate measures to be taken to increase the bus fares in correspondence to the continuous increasing of fuel prices.

Commenting regarding the matter, the chief secretary of the All-Ceylon Private Bus Owners’ Association, Anjana Priyanjith said: “Earlier, the price of diesel was raised by Rs. 29 per litre, and then the relevant prices were increased again by Rs. 05 yesterday. Therefore, the bus fares must be increased”.

The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CEYPETCO), Lanka IOC, and Sinopec had implemented fuel price revisions with effect from midnight yesterday.

Accordingly, the price of Petrol 92 Octane has been increased by Rs. 05 to Rs. 368 per litre while Petrol 95 Octane has been reduced by Rs. 08 to Rs. 456 per litre.

Auto Diesel price has been increased by Rs. 05 to Rs. 360 per litre and Super Diesel has been slashed by Rs. 07 with the new price set at Rs. 468 per litre.
