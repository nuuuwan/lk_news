Telin and Dialog Axiata ink strategic partnership to manage international voice and SMS termination

Dialog Axiata PLC, Sri Lanka’s #1 connectivity provider, and Telin, the international arm of Telkom Indonesia, have signed a new Master Service Agreement (MSA) whereby Telin will exclusively provide Managed Services for international A2P SMS traffic and international voice termination traffic to Dialog.

This agreement aims to monetize international traffic while extending unparalleled convenience, enhanced security, global coverage and consistent service quality to Dialog customers. The signing symbolized the commitment of both organizations to enhance telecommunication services around the world.

The rise of spam, fraud, and unsolicited SMS messages has increasingly become a pressing concern for a multitude of operators in the telecommunications industry. With the exponential growth of mobile communication and digital connectivity, the proliferation of unwanted messages poses significant challenges to both consumers and service providers alike.

Telin manages the international voice and messaging of its sister company, Telkomsel, protecting the Telkomsel brand and providing quality connectivity for hyperscalers and carriers to connect to the Telkomsel customers.

“We are very pleased to partner with Dialog, as they are mostly concerned about protecting their customers and network from unwanted traffic. They understand the challenges in the market and have been very reasonable in the negotiations of this agreement. We hope that other MNO’s can follow their lead so that trust is restored in the A2P and Voice businesses around the world”, stated Budi Satria Dharma Purba, CEO Telin.

Commenting, Supun Weerasinghe, Director/Group Chief Executive of Dialog Axiata PLC said, “We are pleased to join forces with Telin in this strategic partnership, reinforcing our commitment to protecting our customers and enhancing the integrity of international communications. This collaboration not only addresses the challenges posed by spam and fraud but also exemplifies our dedication to delivering consistent service quality and enhanced security to our valued customers. Together with Telin, we look forward to pioneering a transformative approach to safeguarding communication channels and building trust in the digital era.”
