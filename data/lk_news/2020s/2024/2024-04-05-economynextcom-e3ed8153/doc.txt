Sri Lankans reluctant to get tested for HIV: State minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s population is reluctant to get tested for HIV-AIDS due to social stigmas, State Minister of Health Dr Sita Arambepola said.

“When the social phobia is there for these diseases people won’t come and get their treatment,” Arambepola told reporters on Friday.

Ministry of Health data shows that there were 694 reported AIDS cases in 2023 with 59 HIV related deaths.

In December, Sri Lanka’s health authorities said compared to 2021, there was a 48 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV in the country in 2022.

Arambepola confirmed there was an increase in HIV AIDS patients. “There are avenues to spread, so definitely its getting increased.”

Two HIV-positive people were identified in Negombo during Police raids of spas recently.

Reports indicate there was a significant increase in HIV with sexually active young people being a high risk group.

“There have been reports of HIV infection among young people between the ages of 15-24. In 2022, 73 of the 607 HIV infected people detected were in this group,” venereologist Dr Thilani Ratnayake said at an event to mark World AIDS Day on December 1.

Early detection and treatment of the condition was key to live normally, Dr Ratnayake said. Once detection is made, the next step is to prevent spread.

Arambepola was speaking at a press briefing to caution against accidents stemming from the unsafe handling of fireworks, and asked “for vigilance and caution with loved ones during this New Year period.” (Colombo/Apr5/2024)
