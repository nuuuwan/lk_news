UNP Dambulla office attacked

In what the United National Party (UNP) led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe has called the first act of pre-election violence ahead of the upcoming Presidential election, the party’s office in Dambulla was attacked by an unidentified group yesterday.

Sports Minister Harin Fernando reported the attack on the UNP’s operational office in Dambulla by an unknown group, suggesting it was an instance of pre-election violence. The attack took place at the residence of former Dambulla municipal councillor Maya Padeniya, according to Minister Fernando.

The Minister said the attackers had damaged hoardings featuring pictures of President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Dambulla electoral organiser installed at the office.

Fernando made the statement to the media after visiting the site, inspecting the damage, and implementing necessary measures to restore the situation.

The Minister said he has directed the police to conduct a full and impartial investigation to identify and apprehend those responsible for the attack.
