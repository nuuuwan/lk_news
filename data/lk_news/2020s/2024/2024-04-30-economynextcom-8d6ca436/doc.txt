Sri Lanka inflation up 3.1-pct over 19-months, food down 4.6-pct

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s inflation was 1.5 percent in the 12-months to April 2024, measured by the widely watched Colombo Consumer Price Index, data from the state debt office showed.

The CCPI Index fell 0.8 percent, to 195.2 points in the month of April after falling 1.9 percent in March.

Sri Lanka’s central bank has been operating largely deflationary policy, since September 2022, except perhaps in December 2024, and also allowed the rupee to appreciate in the balance of payments surplus it created.

Since September 2022, when deflationary policy started to show up in the balance of payments, the index has grown only 3.1 percent over the past 19 months.

The food price index fell 4.6 percent over the past 19 months. (Colombo/Apr30/2024)
