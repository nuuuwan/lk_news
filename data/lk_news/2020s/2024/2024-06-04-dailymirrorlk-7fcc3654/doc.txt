India election results 2024: BJP alliance leads, opposition fights on

12.05 PM - Veteran actor Raj Babbar is leading in Gurgaon seat on Congress ticket by over 30,000 seats

11.58 AM -Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's alliance raced to a majority in early vote counting trends in the general election, but the numbers were well short of the landslide predicted in exit polls. Opposition gains are higher than expected.

11.48 AM - When Narendra Modi launched his campaign with the slogan “Ab ki baar, 400 paar,” he aimed for more than 400 seats for his BJP-led NDA alliance. The most optimistic exit polls even predicted a clear 400 seats for them.

However, early trends indicate a much tighter contest with the Congress-led INDIA alliance, a centre-left coalition. Speculation is already rife about whether the BJP alone will reach the 272 seats needed for a majority in the 543-seat parliament.

The lead between the two coalitions appears narrower than expected, with early trends showing a difference of only 60 to 70 seats.

11.32 AM - As early trends show the INDIA alliance crossing 200 seats, the mood at the BJP office appears to have become distinctly guarded.

Party spokespersons, however, are maintaining that the NDA alliance is comfortably placed to form the next government.

The opposition alliance's performance in early trends appears to have come as a surprise to many party workers here.

However, some party spokespersons say it's still too early to comment and things will only be clear by noon.

11.24 AM - The election commission has released the current leads in 541 out 543 Lok Sabha seats.

The BJP-led NDA alliance is now leading on 282 seats, while the Congress and its allies are ahead in 219 constituencies.

The BJP is leading is leading on 237 seats, while the Congress is ahead on 97. In the previous election, the BJP won a total of 303 seats.

11.21 AM - The All India Trinamool Congress, a member of the opposition INDIA alliance and the party ruling the eastern state of West Bengal, is ahead in 29 of the state’s 42 seats in leads so far.

If that trend holds, the BJP, which is ahead in 10 seats, will be disappointed. West Bengal is a state where the BJP has made major gains in recent years after having almost no presence for decades. It’s a state Prime Minister Modi has personally spent several days in, campaigning and accusing the Trinamool Congress of corruption and political violence.

11.10 AM - The Telugu Desam Party, a regional outfit in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh that is a part of the BJP’s national alliance, appears poised for a comfortable win in state legislature elections that were held alongside the parliamentary vote.

According to the latest updated from the election commission, the TDP is ahead in 125 out of the state’s 175 assembly seats. The Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP), which currently rules the state, is ahead in only 20 constituencies.

In the Lok Sabha vote too, the TDP is ahead in 15 of the state’s 25 constituencies, with the YSRCP ahead in four constituencies.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led alliance is leading as India counts votes after a mammoth seven-phase election – the world’s largest democratic exercise – that began on April 19 and ended on Saturday.

A party or coalition needs 272 seats to cross the majority mark in the 543-member Lok Sabha, the lower house of India’s parliament.

Exit polls show Modi is well on track to return to power for a third consecutive term, while the Indian National Congress party-led opposition bloc hopes to upstage him.

The Election Commission says a record-breaking 642 million voters cast their ballots in the staggered election as it dismissed opposition concerns over how the votes would be counted.

However, the voter turnout this year was 66.3 percent, about one percentage point lower than 2019.
