Indian election and presidential pardon can of worms

The week that passed was packed with newsworthy events at home and abroad led by the Indian election results. Prime Minister Narendra Modi emerged the winner but not as comfortably as widely forecast. Although his BJP with its NDA allies cleared the simple majority hurdle, the Modi party did not do so on its own and is dependent on two regional parties, Telegu Desam from Andhara Pradesh and Janata Dal from Bihar to command a parliamentary majority.

The Economist, the respected British journal, encapsulated the final outcome with the headline, “A shock election result in India humbles Narendra Modi.” But the post-election rhetoric of the prime minister, who takes his oaths for the third consecutive time on Sunday June 9, was anything but humble. Ignoring the negatives of his own and his party’s performance, he focused on what he called “the victory for democracy in India.”

Modi’s three-in-a-row is, of course, is a record equaling that of Jawahar Lal Nehru. But the two personalities are as different from each other as chalk and cheese. Modi was born into poverty, working as a chai wallah (tea seller) in his boyhood while Nehru was born with the proverbial silver spoon in his mouth.

Nehru stood strong for a secular India while Modi’s Hindutva tendencies are all too apparent. Most analysts are united in the assessment that the Muslims in India, second only to the number in Indonesia, largely and unsurprisingly voted against Modi and his BJP. Also, the result in Faizabad, a constituency where Modi recently inaugurated the massive Ram temple built on a site where a mob of Hindu nationalists in 1992 demolished a Muslim mosque, was a very visible loss for the BJP.

When President Ranil Wickremesinghe telephoned Modi to congratulate him on his election victory even before the final result had been declared, he was invited to attend the inauguration ceremony where most South Asian leaders will be present. Pakistan will, of course not be there given the long standing enmity between the two neghbouring countries.

Our president, since he took office to serve out the balance Gotabaya Rajapaksa term, has been a frequent traveler, much more so than any of his predecessors in the executive office. His state and other visits have been numerous. However, given the exceptional assistance received from India to help us out of our economic woes, non-acceptance of Modi’s invitation would have been less than gracious.

Between the time this is being written and the actual swearing of the Indian prime minister, there was the predictable jockeying for cabinet and lesser posts by both the BJP’s key allies and other smaller parties. Most observers expected the Modi party to retain key ministries at the commanding heights of the economy but realpolitik will demand some concessions. Meanwhile Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, leading the INDIA alliance and considered the likely new leader of the opposition, called a press conference to discuss not the election results but stock market behaviour between May 31 and June 3. The exit polls, which were proved wildly off, drove the indices to an all time high but the market crashed thereafter. Gandhi demanded a joint party committee of parliament to probe what happened. The BJP has rejected his allegations and claimed small investors had done nicely.

Sri Lanka, last week saw the comfortable passage of the new Electricity Amendment Bill, despite former president Mahinda Rajapaksa’s recent appeal that any intended privatization of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) be held over until the forthcoming election cycle is completed.

This legislation will enable the “unbundling” of the CEB to several entities and private sector participation in some of those is anticipated. But Rajapaksa himself voted for the Bill as did the majority of his SLPP colleagues who ensured a 44 vote majority with 103 votes for and 59 against. There is no escaping the reality that the Bill was drafted abysmally badly with the supreme court holding that many of its provisions violated the constitution.

The government was clearly in a hurry to enact this legislation, preferring to accommodate only the amendments proposed by the court to enable its speedy enactment. From a consumer perspective, the assurance given by Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera that there will be substantial reductions in the electricity tariffs which were massively increased in recent months, will be most welcome. The minister also said that the CEB unions, strongly opposed to the changes, will be “finished” by the enactment of the new law. Nevertheless this will probably not be the end of the story as many credible issues, including the rates per unit to be paid for as many as 20 years for Adani produced wind power, await resolution.

The unanimous judgment of a three judge bench of the supreme court over the pardon granted by President Sirisena to the convict in the July 2005 Royal Park murder case, Don Shramantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha, opened a massive can of worms. Sirisena, already ordered to pay Rs. 100 million compensation over negligence charges on the Easter bombing, has now been directed to pay a million rupees to the petitioner, the Women and Media Collective, to be held in trust to be utilized for the welfare of female crime victims. Fortunately for Jayamaha, he left the country soon after his pardon and release from prison. Whether he can be brought back to serve his sentence as ordered by court remains an open question. Remember, Arjuna Mahendran remains in Singapore but he is no convict.

Duminda Silva was less fortunate. He too left the country after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa pardoned him after conviction on a murder rap. But he returned and was chairman of the National Housing Development Authority and was in the country when a court determination sent him back to jail. He remains a long term inmate of the prison hospital, we are told.
