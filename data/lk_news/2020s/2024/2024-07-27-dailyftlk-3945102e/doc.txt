National sustainability standard for Ceylon tea soon

Agriculture and Plantation Industries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera on Thursday unveiled ambitious plans to establish a comprehensive National Sustainability Standard for Ceylon Tea by the end of 2024.

This was announced during the opening session of the two-day

Industry experts, leading brands, and social organisations from numerous countries, including Kenya, China, India, Japan, the UK, the Gulf countries, and the US, gathered at the convention, representing the entire global tea value chain from crop to cup.

He said the landmark initiative aims to solidify the country’s position in the global tea industry, whilst addressing pressing challenges like climate change, enhancing the welfare of plantation workers and smallholder farmers.

Amaraweera stressed that the new sustainability standard marks a significant milestone for Sri Lanka’s tea sector, setting the stage for a regenerative agriculture model focused on low-carbon tea production.

“This approach will be underpinned by rigorous life cycle analysis to ensure that tea production processes are not only environmentally sustainable but also economically viable,” he added. The Minister underscored the importance of global collaboration in securing the future of Ceylon Tea amidst global challenges facing the industry.

The convention, hosted by the Colombo Tea Traders Association and supported by the Sri Lanka Tea Board, serves as a crucial platform for stakeholders to discuss strategies for sustaining the tea industry in the face of evolving consumer preferences and environmental demands.

Acknowledging the efforts of the organising committee and industry stakeholders, Amaraweera expressed gratitude for their dedication in shaping a sustainable future for tea.

He highlighted the convention’s role in encompassing the entire tea value chain, from cultivation to consumption and stressed the importance of collective action in advancing the industry.
