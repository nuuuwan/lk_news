Dayasiri says no faith in Maithripala’s leadership

MP Dayasiri Jayasekara states that the new alliance planned to be formed by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has decided to support President Ranil Wickremesinghe in the upcoming presidential election.

Furthermore, MP Dayasiri claimed that none of the political parties have any faith on the alliances formed by the former President Maithripala Sirisena.

“Many people don’t believe in the leadership of Maithripala Sirisena now”, he said.

“I saw the last week’s rally held by Mr. [Nimal] Lanza, and noticed that they are going to back President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The alliance they are going to form… the SLFP will support Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe. It is a problem for the SLFP supporters at the grass-root level”, he added.
