Sri Lanka to build floating solar power plants on Chandrika Wewa, Kiriiban Wewa

ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Irrigation will allocate 0.99 hectares of water surface area and 0.1 hectares of land area from the Chandrika Wewa and Kiriibban Wewa reservoirs for two floating solar power generation pilot projects.

The cabinet of ministers has approved a proposal by the Minister of Irrigation to make the allocation for the two projects which are the result of an agreement between Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Power & Energy and the Korean government’s Korea Institute for Advancement.

The land and water surface areas will be granted to the Sri Lanka Solar Energy Authority on an annual lease basis for running the two solar pilot projects, each with a capacity of 1 megawatt, a statement from the government information department said in a statement.

“A request had been made to provide 0.99 hectares each on the water surface of the Chandrika Wewa, located in the Embilipitiya Divisional Secretariat area, and the Kiriibban Wewa, located in the Sewanagala Divisional Secretariat area, and plots of 0.1 hectares each from the reservoir reserves for activities such as construction of power plants and transmission stations, training of maintenance workers and maintenance of solar panels.

“Implementation of the proposed projects will add about 3 gigawatt hours of annual electricity generation to the national grid,” the statement said.

Irrigation Minister Sashindra Rajapsksa said in January that the government has identified locations in 31 reservoirs which can be used to built 3,077 megawatts of floating solar plants.

Floating solar plants totaling 2,534 megawatts could be built on 14 reservoirs belonging to Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority, the minister said at the time.

Another 553 MW of solar plants are planned on 17 reservoirs belonging o the Department of Irrigation.

A 120MW hydro power plant at Uma Oya will be opened on February 15.

Power & Energy Minister Kanchana Wijeseakra said in October 2023 that Sri Lanka’s state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) will allow private developers to build floating solar plants on a reservoir owned by the utility. (Colombo/Mar05/2024)
