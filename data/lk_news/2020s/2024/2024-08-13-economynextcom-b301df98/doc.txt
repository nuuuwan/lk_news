Sri Lanka panel mandates wages for plantations workers

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Wages Board has passed mandated wage of 1,700 rupees a day for plantations workers, which legislators backing the workers, said amounted to 2,000 rupee a day with provident fund benefits.

Plantations companies went to court to block and earlier decision, as politicians threatened to expropriate firms that did not carry out the decision.

“There is a 1350 wage for which there is EPF, ETF and gratuity,” legislator Vadivel Suresh told reporters.

“And there is a 350 incentive. That they have to pay. With the EPF and ETF, it will exceed 2,000 rupees.”

The 1,700 wage was announced by President Ranil Wickremesinghe at a May Day rally earlier in the year.

Politicians of the ruling coalition threatened to expropriated plantation companies that did not pay the mandated wage.

“About 14 boards voted in favour of the 1,700 wage,” Water Minister Jeevan Kumaratunga, who represents the Ceylon Workers Congress, the main labour union, said after the decision.

“I would like to say to those who say this is a politically motivated decision that we started this campaign nearly one year ago.

“We did not ask for 1,700 because of any political motives. We asked for 1,700 according to Fair Trade International Labour standards.”  (Colombo/Aug12/2024)
