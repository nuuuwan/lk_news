Sirikotha doors open to SJBers including Harsha: Range Bandara

Colombo, March 26 (Daily Mirror) - The doors of UNP headquarters Sirikotha are open at all times to all Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) members, UNP General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara said today.

“Our doors are open to SJBers to join us any time. Therefore, we invite all those who left us over various reasons to re-join us,” Range Bandara told a media briefing.

“SJBers are being sidelined by its leadership. It is not Harsha de Silva who decides the SJB's stand on the economy today but others such as Nalaka Godahewa. Therefore, we invite those such as Harsha to join us. Join us before you perish,” he said.

Also he said SJBers from the grassroots level have already begun coming back to the UNP.

“I had a discussion with some SJBers before I came for this briefing,” he said.

Asked about the National People's Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s visit to Canada, Range Bandara said that Anura Kumara Dissanayake should understand that elections will be held in Sri Lanka and not in Canada.
