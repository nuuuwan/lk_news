Scandal erupts over Keheliya given special transport privileges, CID launches probe

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has initiated investigations into an incident in which former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella who is in remand custody has been transported to court using a bus donated by UNICEF for the transportation of children of female inmates.

The CID has received a complaint that the prison authorities have used this bus for the transportation of Mr. Rambukwella despite UNICEF stipulating that it should be used solely for the benefit of female inmates' children.

It is reported that others who were remanded along with Mr. Rambukwella were transported using a prison bus. However, it is questioned why such a special privilege was accorded to Mr. Rambukwella.
