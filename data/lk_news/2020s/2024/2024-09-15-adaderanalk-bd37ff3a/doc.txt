Anura Kumara threatens legal action against critics over ‘conspiracy theories’

Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the presidential candidate of the National People’s Power (NPP), vowed to hold accountable those who spread false information out of fear of the NPP’s potential victory.

Addressing a public rally in Mirigama, Dissanayake expressed his intent to pursue legal action against individuals who disseminate misleading claims.

Dissanayake criticized his political opponents, accusing them of resorting to conspiracy theories as their primary defense. “Their politics have deteriorated to the point where they can only respond with baseless conspiracy theories,” Dissanayake stated. He contrasted his campaign’s focus on national unity with what he described as the divisive rhetoric of his opponents.

Drawing comparisons, Dissanayake noted that while Ranil Wickremesinghe and Sajith Premadasa align with regional leaders Athaullah (A. L. M. Athaullah, MP) and Hakeem (Rauff Hakeem, MP) respectively, his own campaign is grounded in a message of unity that has been a longstanding principle of his party. He rebuked Premadasa for relying on outdated racial narratives, suggesting that such tactics are unworthy of contemporary politics.

In response to criticisms from figures like SJB’s Tissa Attanayake, who alleged that a government led by the National People’s Power would disrupt traditional cultural events like the Perehara, Dissanayake promised to hold these critics accountable in court. “We will bring all those who have spread such falsehoods about our intentions in a Perehara (procession) to the court,” he declared.
