Colombo, Feb 22 (Daily Mirror) - A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between Sri Lanka and Vietnam on a number of issues, including the exchange of agricultural technology and the development of the agricultural sector in both countries.

Agriculture and Plantation Industry Minister Mahinda Amaraweera and Agriculture and Rural Development Minister of Vietnam Minh Hoan Le held bilateral discussions yesterday (21) in conjunction with the 37th Asia Pacific Conference of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.

The agreement was signed on several matters such as agricultural technology, studies and research, exchange of experience, advanced seed production, application of fertilizers and pesticides, and training of farmers and officials so that they can get more yields.

The Vietnam Agriculture Minister expressed his pleasure regarding the fact that Sri Lanka has now become self-sufficient in rice. He also stated that Sri Lanka's potential in food production should be appreciated, even though it is experiencing a difficult economic period.

Meanwhile, Minister Amaraweera said that although many people assumed that there was a food shortage in Sri Lanka due to the economic collapse, the people of Sri Lanka did not face a food crisis due to the measures taken by the government and the farmers despite the obstacles. He also said that the people should express their gratitude to the Sri Lankan farmers.
