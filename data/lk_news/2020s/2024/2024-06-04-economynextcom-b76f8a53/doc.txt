Sri Lanka to halt illegal landfills, relocate hospitals in flood-prone areas: President

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s President Ranil Wickremesinghe has instructed officials to halt illegal landfills in flood-prone areas and to relocate the Mulleriyawa and IDH hospitals to alternative locations.

“Officials have been directed to be vigilant about illegal landfills and any new construction in the Kelani River valley that could contribute to increased flooding risks,” Wickremesinghe said on X platform (twitter).

“I ordered the relocation of the Mulleriyawa and IDH hospitals to alternative locations.”

Wickremesinghe visited Kolonnawa, Kelaniya, and Ambatale to assess the welfare of those affected by the floods.

He recommended swift relocation from flood-prone areas and the use of aqueducts to divert floodwaters.

Funding will be allocated for relief efforts, cleaning operations, epidemic prevention measures (such as dengue, rat fever, and diarrhea), and the repair of damaged infrastructure including bridges, bays, and roads, the president said.

“I have also instructed the rebuilding of all houses that have been completely destroyed by the disaster, with support from the government, armed forces, and police, within the next two months.

“We are currently discussing the development of a proactive flood control program.” (Colombo/Jun3/2024)
