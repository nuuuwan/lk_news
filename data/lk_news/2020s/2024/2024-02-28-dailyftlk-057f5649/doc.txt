These partnerships reflect the commitment to fostering inclusion and leadership among women and their continuous support to the WCIC.“The WLF 2024 of WCIC will focus on inclusion. We will focus on some critical areas that hamper inclusion in organisations. One such area is GBVH at workplace. The chamber actively drives the agenda to create workplaces free from GBVH in collaboration with CIPE. We intend to share some very interesting research findings through extensive qualitative research the Chamber conducted. The event will also consist of a centred leadership workshop by McKinsey and Co, which will be extremely valuable to all participants,” commented the Project Chair Tusitha Kumarakulasingam.
