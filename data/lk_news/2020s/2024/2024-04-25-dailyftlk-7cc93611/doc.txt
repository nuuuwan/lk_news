Interim injunction issued against Wijeyadasa’s SLFP Acting Chairmanship

The Colombo District Court issued an interim injunction against Minister of Justice Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from performing duties as the Acting Chairperson of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) yesterday.

A similar injunction was also issued against the SLFP Acting General Secretary Sarathi Dushmantha Mithrapala.

The injunctions, in effect until 8 May, were granted considering a case filed by SLFP office bearers Lasantha Alagiyawanna, Duminda Dissanayake, and Mahinda Amaraweera.

Chandaka Jayasundara PC representing the plaintiffs told the courts that it is illegal and against the party’s constitution for the defendants to hold the positions.

Jayasundara noted that Rajapakshe’s membership status disqualifies him from holding any position within the SLFP, citing constitutional illegality in having a member of another party in such a role.

Additionally, Jayasundara highlighted that the Executive Committee convened on 21 April to appoint Rajapakshe was unlawful.

The SLFP’s pro-Sirisena faction appointed Rajapakshe as its Acting Chairperson on 21 April amidst a serious intra-party rift. Previously on 8 April, the SLFP faction led by former party leader Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, party office bearers Duminda Silva, Mahinda Amaraweera and Lasantha Alagiyawanna appointed SLFP Senior Vice President Nimal Siripala de Silva as the party’s Acting Chairman replacing the embattled Chairman Maithripala Sirisena.

Each faction has refused to accept the appointments made by each other and taken steps to take the matter to the courts.
