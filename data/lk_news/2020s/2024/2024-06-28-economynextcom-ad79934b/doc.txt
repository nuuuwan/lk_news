Sri Lanka could face unrest as in Kenya if economic stability not established: President

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s president has pointed to Kenya’s current struggle with a severe economic crisis and incidents of violence, and said economic preparedness in all nations was a crucial need.

“Recent riots in Kenya, where around 20 people have been shot dead, highlight the consequences of economic instability. If we do not establish economic stability in Sri Lanka, we could face similar unrest,” President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.

Wickremesinghe was speaking at the Presidential Environment Awards ceremony at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) in Colombo on Friday.

He said Sri Lanka’s economic stability has effectively prevented comparable challenges within the country.

“Sri Lanka has taken the first step toward debt restructuring, moving us out of bankruptcy.

“Our next step is to implement the Economic Transformation Law to continue this progress.

However, this process is challenging for countries like those in Africa, which require relief, Wickremesinghe said.

Sri Lanka has proposed the complete cancellation of debts for African countries at the Climate Change Conference.

“Funds should be allocated to these countries, and Sri Lanka fully supports this initiative.

“However, Sri Lanka does not seek such aid for itself; we are managing our debt independently, utilizing our energy and knowledge. We must continue this path, transforming into a competitive, digital, and green economy. Let us advance on this journey with our own strength.”

The Presidential Environment Awards, organized annually by the Central Environment Authority, recognises industries, business institutions, and individuals for their outstanding contributions to environmental conservation.

This year, 124 recipients received gold, silver, bronze medals and special awards across various sectors including industries, businesses, project organizations, media organizations, and society.

Wickremesinghe participated in presenting the gold awards, accompanied by the Chairman of Central Environment Authority (CEA) Venura Fernando and Director General Hemantha Jayasinghe. (Colombo/June28/2024)
