Govt. appoints Acting Controller General for Department of Immigration and Emigration

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved appointing the Public Security Ministry Additional Secretary B.M.D. Nilusha Balasuriya as the acting Controller General of the Department Immigration and Emigration (DIE) with immediate effect.

Speaking at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Vijitha Herath said the decision follows the remand of the former DIE Controller General Harsha Ilukpitiya, who has been ordered remanded from 25 September by the Supreme Court over contempt charges.

“Since former Controller General has been remanded till January, it was necessary to appoint a suitable officer to perform the critical duties in the post,” he explained.

He said the signature of the Controller General was necessary in issuing passports and thus filling the vacated post was important.

Acting Controller General Balasuriya is a special Grade Officer of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service.
