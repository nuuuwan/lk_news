Sri Lanka needs new education system for economic transformation: Pres

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka needs a new education system that aligns with global standards and can cultivate professionals suited for the competitive world market, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said.

“I firmly advocate for education reforms and the creation of a new educational paradigm in our country. Our focus should be on nurturing professionals who can thrive in the global arena,” Wickremesinghe was quoted as saying in a statement by his office, at St Anthony Girls’ College, Kollupitiya today (14).

“To drive economic transformation, our education system must align with international standards, equipping students to compete effectively,” Wickremesinghe said after distributing free school textbooks and uniforms to the students.

“By alleviating exam pressures and incorporating English and technology subjects, we aim to groom a workforce ready for the demands of the modern world. Plans are also underway to establish vocational colleges and technical universities to further this objective.”

The distribution program extends to providing textbooks and uniforms to student monks and nuns across 10,126 schools and 822 piriven throughout the island.

The Chinese government donated 80 percent of the school uniforms provided today, while the Sri Lankan Government covered the remaining 20 percent, according to the statement. Textbook printing utilized paper from the Indian loan aid scheme.

Wickremesinghe said he has always been concerned about education: “I live near five schools, namely my school Royal College, Thurston College, Ladies’ College, Mahanama College, and St Anthony’s Girls’ College. This background has instilled in me a deep concern for education.” (Colombo/Feb14/2024)
