Train strike to begin tomorrow

Colombo, June 6 (Daily Mirror) - The Locomotive Operating Engineers Union has decided to launch a train strike at midnight tomorrow due to further delays in the second-class promotions of locomotive drivers, continuous delays in recruitment due to a lack of a salary code, and other issues.

While sending a letter to the Railways General Manager (GMR), the union secretary claimed that the decision was taken after having informed the GMR several times.

Due to not receiving any favorable response, the union has decided to engage with the trade union action starting at midnight tomorrow.
