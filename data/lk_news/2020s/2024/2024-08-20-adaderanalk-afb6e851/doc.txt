Childhood asthma on the rise in Sri Lanka, health officials warn

The reports of diseases such as childhood asthma have increased these days, according to the Consultant Paediatrician of Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children Dr. Deepal Perera.

He further stated that there is an increase in the influenza cases being reported over the past couple of days.

He noted that if a child exhibits symptoms such as a cough and difficulty in breathing, it could be a sign of asthma. According to him, both influenza and various viral fevers are currently spreading and, particularly the fever is affecting the upper respiratory tract. He added that the situation could likely worsen.

“Therefore, if a child has a cough, cold or fever it is advisable to keep the child at home,” said the Consultant Paediatrician.

He further advised that if children are showing such symptoms they should wear a mask and urged parents to be extra cautious about the potential increase in asthma and respiratory diseases among children.

“Coughing occurring mainly during the night might be a sign of childhood asthma”, warned Dr. Deepal.

He also noted that if a cough is accompanied by chest pain and fever, it is important to keep an eye on the fever, as it could potentially develop into pneumonia while emphasizing the importance to check whether the illness might be affecting the lower respiratory tract and upper respiratory tract due to the prevailing cold climatic conditions.
