Merlina & Mission

Dubai seems to be the number one destination for Merlina Fernando and that’s where she is at the moment, since early 2023, operating as Merlina & Mission.

They are being featured at the Citymax Hotel Bur Dubai and are doing this scene as a trio.

This is not Merlina’s first assignment in Dubai; her very first trip was in 2006 with the band Dream Team, and, since then, she has been checking out Dubai on a regular basis.

Before travelling to Dubai, Merlina was performing with her husband, as a duo, in the Maldives.

Initially, they operated as a four-piece outfit, when they got to Dubai in 2023, but at a different venue.

Says Merlina: “We got a good offer and so we decided to switch venues, and the Citymax Hotel Bur Dubai, where we now perform, is awesome.

“We are featured at the High So, six nights a week, from 9.30 pm onwards, along with a DJ, and the crowd is great, and we are extremely happy doing our thing here.”

Merlina & Mission move into action with Merlina on vocals, Suresh on lead guitar and vocals, and Kushan on conga and percussion.

Elaborating further, Merlina said that the Citymax Hotel belongs to one of the biggest multinational companies based in Dubai (UAE), called Landmark Group.

“We have Citymax Hotels across the country, and also in Egypt, and our hotel is located in Bur Dubai, and it’s constantly full…with guests – tourists.

“Our repertoire is wide and varied and include the best in pop, rock and jazz, from the ’80s,’90s, and the latest songs.”

Merlina’s musical career includes performing with the band Dream Team, in Dubai, in 2006, with Aquarius (2008), with Amazon (2009 to 2011) in Dubai, Misty (2011 to 2018), duo scene as MERSH, and Merlina & Mission (since 2018).

Merlina says she does miss her family, friends, fans and music lovers back home but added “It’s a happy scene here, in Dubai, and we do have a great time with friends, on our off days.”
