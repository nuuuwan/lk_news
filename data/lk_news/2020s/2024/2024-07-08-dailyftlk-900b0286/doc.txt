Meiro expands to Sri Lanka with $ 3 m pre-Series A funding

Meiro, a leading customer data platform, has announced its strategic expansion into the Sri Lankan market following a successful $ 3 million pre-Series A funding round.

This round was led by Southeast Asian venture capital firm Wavemaker Partners, with significant participation from angel investors at Singapore-based Angel Central.

With the newly secured funding, Meiro plans to leverage the potential of the Sri Lankan market, aiming to hire skilled professionals locally to support its growth. The company’s expansion into Sri Lanka underscores its commitment to driving digital transformation and enhancing customer experience (CX) personalisation in the region.

Sri Lanka presents a promising landscape for digital innovation, and Meiro is poised to empower businesses with cutting-edge solutions that harness the power of customer data. By enabling businesses to revolutionise their marketing strategies through AI-driven personalisation, Meiro aims to foster deeper customer engagement and significantly improve marketing efficiency.

Meiro Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Jana Marlé-Zizková and Meiro Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer Pavel Bulowski, last week attended the Digital Marketing Association of Sri Lanka Summit in Colombo. They delivered keynotes on “Marketing Vision 2030 – Why Customer Data Needs to be at the Core of Marketing Strategy” and “Customer Data Strategies for CMOs”. Their participation emphasises Meiro’s dedication to knowledge sharing and innovation in the marketing sector.
