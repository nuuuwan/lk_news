Sri Lankans in Israel cautioned as attacks intensifies

Sri Lanka’s Ambassador to Israel has requested Sri Lankan nationals residing in Israel to exercise caution due to recent shelling and rocket attacks from Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah targeting Israel.

Hezbollah has fired a fresh barrage of strikes into northern Israel, including Haifa, Galilee, Golan, and Nazareth areas, a day after Israeli airstrikes targeting the militant group in Lebanon killed nearly 500 people and wounded 1,600 others.

However, debris from the interceptions of these shelling and missile attacks by Israel’s iron dorm system have caused fires in the dry forest areas.

Under these circumstances, the Sri Lankan Ambassador to Israel, Nimal Bandara has advised the Sri Lankans residing in Israel to remain vigilant with regard to these attacks that are being carried out from time to time.

He urged that Sri Lankans employed in northern zones of Israel to move to the nearest safety shelters for their protection whenever the alarms signaling such attacks are activated.
