Bridge collapses causing traffic standstill at Embilipitiya

Embilipitiya, Feb 05, (Daily Mirror) -Â  The bridge across the Hulanda Oya on the Embilipitiya-Middeniya road, originating from the Kumbugodaara area collapsed, creating a traffic standstill.

The incident, which occurred between 6:30 and 7:30 an was caused by a lorry loaded with timber.

According to local residents, water supply has also been disrupted in some areas due to the incident.

The bridge, constructed in 1985 during the tenure of late President Ranasinghe Premadasa, collapsed due to the widening of the road on both sides without proper maintenance. The widening, according to locals, left the bridge vulnerable, leading to its collapse this morning.
