15-hour water cut in Colombo and suburbs

The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) announced that a 15-hour water cut will be imposed for several areas including Colombo and suburbs tomorrow (29).

Accordingly, the water supply will be suspended from 9 a.m. tomorrow (29) until 12 midnight in Colombo, Dehiwala, Mount Lavinia, Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, Kaduwela Municipal Council area, Maharagama, Boralesgamuwa, Kolonnawa Urban Council area and Kotikawatte-Mulleriyawa Pradeshiya Sabha area.

Meanwhile, for the Moratuwa Municipal Council area, the water supply will be under low-pressure conditions.

The water cut is attributed to the suspending of the power supply to the Ambatale Water Treatment Plant owing to essential maintenance work planned by the Ceylon Electricity Board and repairs at the treatment plant.

The NWSDB has requested people residing in the aforementioned areas to take the necessary steps to collect water required for the duration of the water cut.
