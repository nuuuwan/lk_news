Niroshan Dickwella suspended from all forms of cricket

Sri Lankan cricketer Niroshan Dickwella has been suspended from participating in all forms of cricket with immediate effect due to an alleged anti-doping violation, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) confirmed.

The suspension will remain in place until further notice, according to the SLC.

Dickwella found guilty of a doping violation during the recent Lanka Premiere League (LPL).

This has reportedly been revealed following a doping test conducted by the Sri Lanka Anti-Doping Agency.

However, SLC stated that the test, which was conducted by the Sri Lanka Anti-Doping Agency (SLADA) during the Lanka Premier League (LPL) 2024, is part of SLC’s ongoing commitment to maintaining the integrity of the sport.

This initiative, undertaken in collaboration with the Ministry of Sports and in accordance with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) guidelines, is aimed at ensuring that cricket remains free from the influence of prohibited substances, it added.

In a statement, the national cricket governing body emphasized that SLC, together with the Ministry of Sports and SLADA, conducts these tests during domestic tournaments randomly to safeguard the sport against anti-doping violations.

“The commitment to a clean and fair game is of utmost importance to SLC, and any allegations of violations are taken with the highest level of seriousness”, it further said.
