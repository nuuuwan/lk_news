SJB govt will amend Sri Lanka’s IMF agreement - Sajith

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leader Sajith Premadasa has reiterated that Sri Lanka’s debt agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would be amended under an SJB government in the future.

“We will definitely work to create a new, amended IMF agreement that is populist, philanthropic, people-friendly and that would guide the country on the correct path,” he said.

The Opposition Leader made this pledge while addressing the SJB’s May Day rally at Chatham Street, Colombo on Wednesday (01).

Premadasa also vowed to bring everyone who is behind the Easter Sunday terror attacks before the law and to ensure maximum punishment is meted out to those involved as well as those who tried to cover it up.

He also said that they will implement a ‘National Youth Project’ that will give prominence to the youth and will also introduce an entrenched clause to establish new independent agencies to help eradicate corruption in the country.
