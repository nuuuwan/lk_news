IMF executive board to meet on June 12 for Sri Lanka’s second review

The Article IV Consultation and second review under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Sri Lanka are on the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Executive Board meeting agenda for June 12, says State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe.

“The session will evaluate Sri Lanka’s economic policies and reform progress,” he said, in a post on ‘X’ (formerly Twitter).

He also said Sri Lanka looks forward for continued support of all countries for a successful review to unlock the third tranche, which will further enhance economic stability, growth, and reform efforts.

IMF staff and the Sri Lankan authorities have reached a staff-level agreement on economic policies to conclude the second review of the four-year EFF-supported program and the 2024 Article IV Consultation, the Director of IMF Communications Julie Kozack said last month.

“Once the review is approved by IMF Management and completed by the IMF Executive Board, Sri Lanka will have access to about US$337 million in financing”, she added.
