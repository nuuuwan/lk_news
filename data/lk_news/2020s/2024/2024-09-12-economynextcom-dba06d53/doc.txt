Sri Lanka bond yields rise ahead of auction; ADB approves $100mn loan

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s bond yields edged up ahead of a 300 billion rupee auction, dealers said though the volume was broadly in line with a maturing volume.

In the secondary market a bond maturing on 15.02.2028 was quoted at 13.30/50 percent, up from 13.15/40 percent on Wednesday.

A bond maturing on 01.07.2028 was quoted at 13.70/85 up from 13.40/55 percent.

Sri Lanka is offering 100 billion rupees of 15 February 2028 bonds, 150 billion rupees of 15 June 2019 bonds and 40 billion rupees of 15 September 2034 bonds.

A September 2029 bond has been quoted at around 13.90/14.25 percent dealers said.

Rupee bond yields have been moving up ahead of an election where there are fears of a change in fiscal policies.

On Wednesday Sri Lanka’s Treasuries yields rose as authorities accepted more three month bills.

Dealers say it may have been better to sell more one year bills at rates higher than 10 percent and reduce the acceptance from the bond auction.

So far this year tax revenues have been strong and the deficit has fallen, helping bring down domestic new borrowing levels compared to last year.

The Asian Development Bank also approved a 100 million dollar budget support loan on September 11.

However rupee bond investors have been cutting portfolios ahead of elections amid uncertainty and concerns over tax and spending policies of opposition parties.

Foreign bond holders have also been selling securities pushing down prices (yields and prices are inversely related). Stock investors have also been selling, with banks taking a beating. (Colombo/Aug12/2024)
