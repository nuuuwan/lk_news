Medical experts ring alarm bells over hot weather

Colombo, Feb 20 (Daily Mirror) -  In light of the prevailing hot weather conditions in the country, medical experts strongly advise individuals to minimize their exposure to sunlight and to drink plenty of fluids on a frequent basis.

Senior Consultant Physician Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama told Daily Mirror that it is highly advisable for people to prioritize hydration by consuming natural beverages such as water, king coconut, while steering clear of artificial drinks.

When asked who could be at risk, he said children, expectant mothers, the elderly and those taking treatment for various illnesses are at risk of dehydration due to the extreme temperatures.

“Thus, those at risk should limit exposure to sunlight and stay hydrated to avoid dehydration. An adult should drink at least 2.5 litres of water,” Dr Wijewickrama pointed out.

Furthermore, he advised schoolchildren to keep away from outdoor activities, especially non-essential outdoor functions.

“Children must be provided with space to play indoors or in the shade. Small children should be encouraged to wear protective hats or caps when outdoors,” he added.

Meanwhile, speaking to the Daily Mirror, Department of Meteorology Director General Athula Karunanayake said, “It is normal to experience hot weather from February to May,”

“However, people are advised to be cautious and avoid exposure to sunlight,” he stated.

In response to a query on the duration of the hot spell, Karunanayake said it is expected to last till April with the onset of monsoonal rains.

"As such, it will take more than two months to experience considerable spells of showers that will bring changes to the prevailing hot weather condition despite minor spells of showers in the meantime," Karunanayake highlighted.

The maximum temperature of 35.6c was reported from Kurunegala yesterday.
