China deports two Lankans arrested from empty container

Two Sri Lankans who tried to hide in an empty container on a ship anchored in the Colombo port and escape to Malaysia were deported from China a year after they were arrested.

The two individuals thus deported from China, arrived at the Katunayake Airport this morning.

On January 30, 2023, they had secretly entered an empty container loaded on the 'MV Merks Unicorn' ship anchored at the CICT jetty in the Colombo port to leave for Malaysia.

After the ship arrived in Malaysia, the two were refused entry by the Malaysian government.

Hence, the authorities of the ship finally arrived in China after taking them to a number of other countries where the Chinese authorities arrested the two individuals.

The two deported individuals were sent from China to the Katunayake Airport by SriLankan Airlines flight UL-867 from Shanghai, China.

After their arrival at Katunayake, they were arrested by the Katunayake Airport Criminal Investigation Department's Trade and Smuggling Investigation Division and brought to the main office in the Kirulapana area of Colombo.
