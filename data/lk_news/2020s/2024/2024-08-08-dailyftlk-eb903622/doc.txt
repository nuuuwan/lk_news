Cabinet approves Bill to grant legal recognition to NBRI

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the proposal to grant legal recognition to the National Building Research Institute (NBRI).

The move follows the Cabinet’s directive on 5 October 2021 to instruct the Legal Draftsman to prepare the necessary bill.

“The Attorney General has cleared the draft Bill prepared by the Legal Draftsman and it will now be published in the Government gazette. Subsequently, the bill will be presented to Parliament for approval,” the Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said.

Speaking at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing, he said the legislative aims to formalise the status of the NBRI, enabling it to operate with greater authority and recognition in its research and development activities related to building and construction.

The proposal, presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as the Defence Minister was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
