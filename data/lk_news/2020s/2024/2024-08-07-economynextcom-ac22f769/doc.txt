Sri Lanka energy minister discusses proposed CEB salary structures, VRS

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera said he had discussed salary structures and a voluntary retirement scheme policy with state-run power utility management and trade unions.

Wijesekera met Ceylon Electricity Board management and trade unions on Monday.

“Progress and current status of CEB reforms, appointments to key new institutes, human resource management policy, proposed new salary structures, performance based incentive systems and the VRS policy was discussed,” the minister said on X (twitter).

Last week the National System Operator and the National Electricity Sector Advisory Council was established with the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers, Wijesekera said.

The government will gradually reduce the 26,000 approved cadre in the CEB through a VRS and by not filling retired cadre position unless it is necessary while restructuring CEB, Wijesekera told reporters last month.

Wijesekera in the past has said the CEB could be managed with only 5,000 cadres instead of the current approved 26,000. (Colombo/Aug7/2024)
