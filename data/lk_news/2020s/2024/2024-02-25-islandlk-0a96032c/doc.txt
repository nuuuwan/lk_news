Sunshine Healthcare introduces skin protectant solution

In a groundbreaking move, Sunshine Healthcare Lanka Limited (SHL), the healthcare arm of Sunshine Holdings PLC, announces the introduction of Cavilon No Sting Barrier Film by 3M to the Sri Lankan market. As the exclusive distributor, SHL is set to revolutionize wound care by providing unparalleled access to high-quality skin protectant products, marking a significant milestone in the country’s healthcare landscape.

Acknowledging patient safety as a top priority, Sunshine Healthcare Lanka recognizes the crucial role of skin protection in preventing healthcare-associated skin damage. The skin, being the body’s largest organ, is vulnerable to various risks in healthcare settings, including prolonged exposure to moisture, friction, shear, adhesives, and irritants, leading to complex conditions such as Moisture Associated Skin Damage (MASD), Pressure Ulcer/Injury (PU/PI), and Medical Adhesive Related Skin Injury (MARSI).

In collaboration with 3M, a globally renowned healthcare innovator, Sunshine Healthcare Lanka is introducing Cavilon, a revolutionary skin protectant solution. The 3M Cavilon No Sting Barrier Film boasts a special terpolymer formula which provides exceptional flexibility and durability. This hypoallergenic and alcohol-free option ensures gentle and effective protection for at-risk skin without causing irritation.
