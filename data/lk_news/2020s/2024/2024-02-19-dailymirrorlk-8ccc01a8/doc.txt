Sri Lanka must have legal framework before adopting nuclear energy projects: IAEA expert

Colombo, Feb 19 (Daily Mirror) - If Sri Lanka is to adopt a nuclear energy generating project, then the country should first have a firm legal framework in place, was the opinion of an international atomic energy expert.

He said there are numerous factors to be considered when taking up a nuclear energy project in a country and the first is to establish a firm legal background.

International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) consultant and expert on nuclear energy Dr. Halil Avci said this while addressing a special forum of local environment authorities and atomic energy officials last week, a spokesperson from the Central Environment Authority (CEA) told the Daily Mirror.

“A country has to first decide whether it is to adopt nuclear power generation projects and consider various environment and other factors. But if they do then there should be a firm legal background,” Avci said.

The IAEA expert was addressing a forum to raise awareness on the factors to be considered when conducting an environment feasibility study before adopting nuclear power generation projects.

Experts including CEA chairman Venura Fernando, Atomic Energy Authority chairman Prof. S.R.D. Rosa, CEA Director General P.B. Hemantha Jayasinghe and a host of officials representing 17 stakeholders in the environment and atomic energy sector took part in the forum.
