Speaker responds to MP Archchuna Ramanathan’s controversial conduct

The Speaker of Parliament Ashoka Ranwala has stated that he intends to discuss with Member of Parliament (MP) Dr. Archchuna Ramanathan regarding his recent controversial conduct.

A video of the independent MP went viral on social media on November 21, which showed him seated in the seat reserved for the Leader of the Opposition in the House and refusing to move despite repeated requests by the parliamentary staff, during the inaugural session of the 10th Parliament.

The MP’s behavior and certain controversial comments he had made on videos posted on social media were the subject of intense discussion even on social media platforms.

The Speaker indicated that he plans to address this matter directly with the MP and will determine the necessary actions following their discussion.

He made these remarks while speaking to the media following his visit to Kandy last afternoon (24).

“We are unaware of his personal objectives. However, the aspirations of the people he represents are unequivocal. The public does not support such conduct in the current political climate. Whether they are from the North, West, or East, all citizens desire unity and development for the country.”

“We recognize that this act was committed by a single individual. We have reviewed his actions and his social media accounts, including Facebook. We will approach this matter prudently, discuss it with him, and seek to resolve it sensibly,” he added.

Additionally, the Speaker affirmed that the current government remains committed to addressing the expectations and aspirations of the people.
