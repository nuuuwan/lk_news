Do not sign English bank agreement forms: Business Alliance urges public

Colombo, March 14 (Daily Mirror) - The Sri Lanka United National Businesses Alliance (SLUNBA) requested businessmen and the people to reject signing relevant bank agreement forms if they are not provided in Sinhala as well.

Addressing the media, SLUNBA Deputy Chairman Susantha Liyanaarachchi urged individuals not to sign English loan agreements from today, as many of these agreements do not clearly state their specified requirements.

After the Cabinet decision to suspend the parate rights of banks till December 15, banks have acquired the properties of the people, he said.

"As there is a significant number of banks operating within the country, the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) today requested the President to issue immediate notes to close those banks if they cannot pass loans for them," he said.

According to the statement issued by the Sri Lanka Bankers Association, they have to close their banks if they cannot conduct business with SMEs, Liyanaarachchi said.
