Schools to be networked and digitized by July

Colombo, June 6 (Daily Mirror) - By the end of July, all schools offering various subject streams will be brought together, and their information will be networked and digitized, Education Minister Susil Premajayantha said.

While attending a programme today at Nalanda Vidyalaya, Colombo, as the chief guest for the commencement of the Advanced Level (A/L) studies for students who recently passed the Ordinary Level (O/L) examinations, the Minister announced that approximately 1,500 leading schools will be networked. He also stated that the pilot project for teaching artificial intelligence, which has already begun, will be implemented in these schools by January 2025.

Additionally, it is essential to provide the necessary training for teachers. This includes updating their knowledge and skills with the use of smart boards and internet resources, he added.

He said the teachers should also be equipped to handle challenges such as managing professional responsibilities when taking sick leave.

It was emphasized that protecting the rights of children who do not have the option to take sick leave is a priority.

The minister mentioned that all these efforts are aimed at saving the children's wasted time and introducing them to the modern world.

By doing so, they are laying the foundation for children to have the right to education, enabling them to complete a bachelor's degree by the age of 21, a postgraduate degree by the age of the age of 23, and a doctorate by the age of the age of 27.

The objective is forward-looking, said the minister, while also expressing gratitude to everyone contributing towards this responsibility.
