Litro ignites spark of fellowship at Scout Jamboree-2024

The recently concluded 10th National Scout Jamboree in Trincomalee, Sri Lanka, not only celebrated international camaraderie but also showcased Litro’s influential role under the visionary leadership of Chairman Muditha Peiris. With a focus on safety, sustainability, and collaboration, Litro’s commitment to national transformation was felt across the event, leaving an indelible mark on the 12,000 scouts from 28 nations.

Litro’s presence at the jamboree aligns with the organization’s three-pillar approach to achieving energy sustainability by prioritizing the environment, society and the economy. In that regard, Litro has worked closely with students in the past years raising awareness and advocating for the use of LPG as a sustainable, safer energy alternative. “At Litro, we firmly believe in the importance of leadership and, as such, we are pleased to have been part of this endeavor to mentor future leaders in energy sustainability. We have educated and raised awareness among the scouts about LPG and allowed them the opportunity to explore & experience our products and services firsthand. This has been an excellent learning opportunity for us as well,” said Chairman of Litro, Muditha Peiris.
