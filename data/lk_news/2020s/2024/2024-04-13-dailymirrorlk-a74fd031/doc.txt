Colombo, April 13 (Daily Mirror) - The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday selected Kristalina Georgieva to serve as IMF Managing Director for a second five-year term starting on October 1, 2024.

"I am deeply grateful for the trust and support of the Fund’s Executive Board, representing our 190 members, and honored to continue leading the IMF as Managing Director for a second five-year term," she said in a statement.

"In recent years, the IMF has helped our member countries navigate successive shocks, including the pandemic, wars and conflicts, and a cost-of-living crisis. We have also intensified our efforts on climate change, fragility and conflict, and the digital transition, aligning with their growing importance for macroeconomic and financial stability, growth, and employment. The IMF’s financial support, policy advice, and capacity development work—delivered by our exceptional staff—have bolstered countries' ability to manage high uncertainty and sudden shifts in economic conditions. We serve as a conduit for sound policies for our members and will continue striving to be more effective, decisive, and a welcoming forum for countries to collaborate in addressing global challenges.

"I eagerly anticipate continuing to serve our membership, alongside the highly professional and dedicated IMF staff," she said.
