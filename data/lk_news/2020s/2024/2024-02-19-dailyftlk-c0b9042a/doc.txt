The Sri Lanka College of Pulmonologists, an esteemed institution dedicated to the field of pulmonology, yesterday kicked off the 14th annual academic session ‘Respire 2024’ at the Cinnamon Grand Colombo.

The session will be held today and tomorrow discussing a range of topical and urgent issues.

This event is a focal point in our college’s calendar and features a distinguished line-up of speakers from across the globe, alongside both domestic and international attendees. The program will encompass a range of activities including pre-congress workshops, plenary sessions, and symposia, all addressing pertinent clinical subjects. Given the prevalent health challenges in Sri Lanka, particularly regarding conditions such as Asthma, Allergic rhinitis, Lung Cancers, Sleep Apnea, Tuberculosis and Pneumonia, there exists a notable lack of public awareness. Consequently, we view this occasion as an opportune platform to disseminate vital information to the community.

Chief Guest at the inauguration was Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana and guest of honour was Pulmonologist Pulmonary and Critical Care Director, Vice President Indian Chest Society Dr. Vijai Kumar. Professor of Respiratory Medicine, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust UK Prof. Athol Wells delivered the Dr. C.G. Uragoda Oration titled “The critical importance of multidisciplinary evaluation - reflections on post-millennial medical thinking.” Health Ministry Secretary Dr. P.G. Mahipala and Sri Lanka College of Pulmonologists President Dr. Bodhika Samarasekara also spoke at the inauguration.
