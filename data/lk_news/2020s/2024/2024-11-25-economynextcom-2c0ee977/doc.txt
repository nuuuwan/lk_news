ADB approves $200mn Sri Lanka loan for battery storage, grid upgrade

ECONOMYNEXT – Manila-based Asian Development Bank said it had approved a 200 million dollar loan to upgrade Sri Lanka’s power grid to accommodate more renewable energy and build a battery storage system.

The loans will be contingent on reforms on cost recovery and competitive renewable energy, the ADB said.

“Driving power sector reforms, combined with targeted infrastructure interventions, is essential to facilitate competitive renewable energy development and reduce power generation costs,” ADB Country Director for Sri Lanka Takafumi Kadono said in the statment.

“By expanding and modernizing infrastructure and incorporating digitalization solutions, this project will support the government’s goal of increased integration of renewable energy in the electricity mix, reduce power interruptions, and minimize transmission and distribution losses.

Ceylon Electricity Board will get 150 million dollars and Lanka Electric Company 50 million dollars.
