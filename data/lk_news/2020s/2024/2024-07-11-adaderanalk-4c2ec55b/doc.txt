Railway strike called off

Sri Lanka Railways trade unions have decided to call off their strike from midnight today (11) following talks with the government.

Meanwhile, Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardene says that if the striking railway employees report for duty, the letters sent considering them as having vacated their posts will be withdrawn.

Earlier today, Minister Gunawardene had stated that letters have been sent to all railway employees who participated in the strike notifying them that they are considered to have vacated their respective positions.

He had stated that the General Manager of Sri Lanka Railways has sent letters informing all Station Masters who have not reported to duties and are engaged in the strike that they are considered to have vacated their positions.

The General Manager of Railways had previously warned that all Station Masters and Railway Controllers who fail to report to duty by 12.00 noon yesterday (10) would be considered as having vacated their positions.

Accordingly, all the striking Railway Station Masters and Railway Controllers were instructed to report for duty at their respective railway stations or at least to the nearest railway station before that deadline.

The Sri Lanka Railways Station Masters’ Union had decided to launch a strike action from midnight on Tuesday (09) based on several demands including promotions.

Railway Controllers had also later decided to join the strike action, which has severely impacted train services in the country and resulted in the cancellation of multiple train journeys, leaving thousands of commuters stranded.

However, the Secretary of the Ministry of Transport Ranjith Rubasinghe had emphasised that since public transport including railway services have been declared as essential services, the strike launched by the Station Masters’ Union is illegal.

Furthermore, he stated that strict disciplinary action would be taken against those who are not reporting for duty.

However, the railway trade unions in question had vowed to continue their strike action despite the warnings from railway authorities and the Transport Ministry.

The Railway Station Masters’ Union had declared earlier today that their strike action will continue further. President of the union Sumedha Somaratne had said that this decision was reached during the executive council meeting of their trade union this evening (11).
