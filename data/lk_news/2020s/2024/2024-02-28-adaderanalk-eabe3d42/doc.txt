Ada Derana journalist acclaimed at int’l digital storytelling festival

Mr. K.C. Saranga, a seasoned journalist of TV Derana, has emerged triumphant at an international media festival in Bangladesh.

He was named the joint winner of the Independent Category at the first-ever Community Digital Storytelling Festival (CDSTF) held in Dhaka recently, alongside Iga Gudas from Poland.

The short docufilm titled ‘Cool Consolation’ directed by Mr. Saranga, who successfully brings to light the plight of the communities marginalized by urbanization in Sri Lanka, was thus acclaimed at the CDSTF.

The festival, organized by the Department of Journalism, Media and Communication at the Daffodil International University in Bangladesh, aims to promote and celebrate the art of storytelling through the use of portable electronic devices.

Mr. Saranga is the General Manager of News and Current Affairs at TV Derana and the founder of the Ada Derana ‘Mojo Force’ which promotes quality mobile journalism in the country. The Mojo Force was created in a bid to transform provincial journalists into mobile journalists.

In 2019, his ‘mojo’ entry highlighting the human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka was shortlisted from more than 150 entries submitted to the Thomson Foundation mobile journalism competition.
