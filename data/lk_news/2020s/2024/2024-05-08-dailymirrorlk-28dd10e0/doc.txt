Sajith plays it safe in Parliament

Colombo, May 8 (Daily Mirror) - Leader of Opposition Sajith Premadasa yesterday raised objections to the questioning of the youth, Sandaru Kumarasinghe, who spoke out against the Visa issue at the airport but avoided debate on the visa fiasco involving a foreign consortium with VFS as technology partner.

He told Parliament that the government must consider the matter involving the youth closed without dragging it. "Sandaru Kumarasinghe only expressed his opinion. In terms of the Constitution, he has a right to freedom of expression," he said.

Mr. Premadasa earlier claimed, as reported on social media platforms, that the visa fiasco could be a greater swindle than the bond scam.
