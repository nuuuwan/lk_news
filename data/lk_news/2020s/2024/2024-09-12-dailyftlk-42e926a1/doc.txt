The Expo presents an ideal platform to showcase our products, services, and innovations, opening doors to new markets.

2. Promoting investment: We should actively promote Sri Lanka as an investment destination at the Expo. Our country offers numerous opportunities in areas like renewable energy, infrastructure development, digital transformation, and tourism. By engaging with potential investors and showcasing our strengths, we can attract capital, technology, and expertise to Sri Lanka.

3. Cultural exchange and tourism: Osaka 2025 offers a chance to highlight Sri Lanka’s unique cultural heritage. By showcasing our art, music, cuisine, and traditions, we can promote Sri Lanka as a prime tourist destination, fostering greater people-to-people connections.

4. Collaborative innovation: The theme of the Expo emphasises innovation and sustainable development. We must explore avenues for joint research and development, knowledge sharing, and innovation between Sri Lankan and Japanese enterprises. This will enable us to create solutions that address global challenges, such as climate change, food security, and technological advancements.

5. Leveraging strategic partnerships: Our relationships with Japanese companies and organisations will be pivotal in our journey toward success at Osaka 2025. We should collaborate closely with Japanese counterparts to create win-win scenarios, ensuring mutual benefit and shared prosperity.
