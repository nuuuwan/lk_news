Clear Vision, Shared Mission: Pan Asia Bank and Rotary Club of Kelaniya illuminate elderly eye care in Matara region

As the “Truly Sri Lankan Bank,” Pan Asia Bank successfully concluded a joint project with the Kelaniya Rotary Club to fulfill a pressing need in the Matara area. Together, they started a large-scale Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) project to open an eye clinic designed with senior citizens in mind.

The program’s main objectives were to elevate the quality of life and overall wellbeing of senior citizens in Matara by providing them with the much-needed eye care services. The services provided ranged from eye examinations to prescriptions of eyeglasses, as well as the option of selecting frames and lenses.

The project’s first day, which spanned two days, saw its inaugural day on April 6, 2024, at the Attorney General’s Office in Matara. Reputed ophthalmologists gave our clients advice and consultations, making sure they got the assistance and treatment they required.

Pan Asia Bank is a private bank that has one of the largest government pensioners customer base in Sri Lanka and more than 100 government retirees from Pan Asia Banks Sammana customer base of Matara were selected to receive eye care and support.
