IMF says to discuss with new Sri Lanka president, economic team

ECONOMYNEXT – An International Monetary Fund (IMF) team will visit Sri Lanka this week to have discussions with the newly elected President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and his economic team, the global lender said.

“A high-level IMF team led by Krishna Srinivasan, Director for the Asia Pacific Department, will be visiting Colombo October 2-4 to meet with President Dissanayake and the new economic team to discuss latest economic developments and economic reforms under Sri Lanka’s economic program supported by the IMF,” the IMF said in a statement.

The IMF last week said it expects to work under Sri Lanka’s new President Dissanayake who was elected at the September 21 elections. The global lender said it will discuss the timing of the third review of its ongoing economic reform under a 48-month loan.

Sri Lanka has committed a raft of economic reforms including increasing tax revenue and restructuring of state-owned enterprises.

Dissananayake’s Marxists Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)-led National People’s Power (NPP) has pledged to renegotiate the IMF deal citing it has led to some unbearable difficulties for common people.

The IMF had earlier scheduled the third review of its $3 billion, 48-month bailout package in October this year.

However, economists have said a discussion between the IMF and the Dissanayake’s new administration has to take place before agreeing on a new schedule, with possible risks of some delay in the disbursement of the fourth tranche of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF).

Originally, the fourth tranche was scheduled for December this year after the completion of the third review. (Colombo/September 30/2024)
