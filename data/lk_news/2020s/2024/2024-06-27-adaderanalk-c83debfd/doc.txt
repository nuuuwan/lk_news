Teachers and principals continue strike today

The teacher-principal trade unions are continuing their strike action today (27) as well, protesting against the firing of tear gas and water cannons to disperse their protest march in Colombo yesterday (26).

The teacher-principal trade unions engaged in an island-wide trade union action by reporting sick leave yesterday (26) based on several demands. At the same time, the members of the trade union launched a protest in Colombo which commenced from near the Colombo Fort Railway Station.

Police later resorted to using tear gas and water cannons to disperse the protesters near the Lotus Roundabout in Fort as they attempted to march towards the Presidential Secretariat.

The strike had disrupted educational activities at schools across the country.

Also, attendance in many schools was very low, and some students who came to school had to return home as they could not enter the premises, said Ada Derana reporter.

Despite the ongoing strike, the Ministry of Education has announced that all government schools will be held as per usual today (27).
