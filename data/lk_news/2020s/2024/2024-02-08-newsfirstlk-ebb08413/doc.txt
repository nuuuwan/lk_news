Police Seize Pagoda-Shaped Sapphires Suspected to be Looted Treasure

COLOMBO (News 1st); In a significant crackdown on illegal gem trade, the Koslanda Police, acting on information provided by the Army Intelligence Division, conducted a raid that led to the seizure of two Sapphire Blue Stones.

These precious gems were being prepared for an illicit sale, with a staggering price tag of Rs. 370 million

Two suspects have been apprehended in connection with this incident, one of whom hails from the Weliveriya area, and identified as a person in robes.

Further investigations have unveiled a startling revelation – the second suspect, a 72-year-old man, is the father of a local politician affiliated with a well-known political party.

The seized gemstones, intriguingly shaped like a pagoda, have raised suspicions, as authorities suspect they may be part of looted treasure.

It is currently believed that these gems may have been procured through such illicit means.

The Koslanda Police are conducting further investigations into this matter.
