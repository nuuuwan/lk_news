Brandix completed its commitment to the Guiding Leadership and Outreach (GLO) programme, empowering 50 individuals across its value chain. Conducted in partnership with the Association for HR Professionals in Sri Lanka and AIESEC, the programme involved companies like Fortude, SyscoLabs, John Keells Holdings, and IFS. In Phase 1, five employees from each company received Train-the-Trainer sessions. In Phase 2, university students developed Sustainable Impact Projects, with one chosen for implementation. Brandix’s selected project was a Professional Skill Upliftment Workshop in Batticaloa, enhancing students’ job application and professional skills.
