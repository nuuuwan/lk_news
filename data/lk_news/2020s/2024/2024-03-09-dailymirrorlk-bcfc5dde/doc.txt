Maintenance activities restrict train operations on Coastal Line

Colombo, March 09 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka Railways has announced that train operations on a section of the Coastal Line, spanning from Colombo Fort to Wellawatte railway stations, will be restricted due to essential maintenance activities.

The Department of Railways has informed that train services will be limited to a single track on March 9, 10 and 11, 2024.

The decision to restrict train operations comes as a result of essential maintenance work on a bridge situated between the Kollupitiya and Slave Island railway stations, alongside pipeline laying activities conducted by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board.

As a consequence, commuters travelling along the coastal line should anticipate possible delays during this period, cautioned the Department of Railways.
