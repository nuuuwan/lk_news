Colombo, May 16 (Daily Mirror) - The U.S. Embassy in Colombo is set to host a satellite event of the Indo-Pacific Business Forum (IPBF) under the theme “Driving Sustainable Development in the Ports Sector” on May 21.

The event will take place concurrently with the Sixth Indo-Pacific Business Forum in Manila, Philippines, co-hosted by the U.S. Trade Development Agency and the Government of the Philippines, in partnership with the U.S. Department of State.

Businesses and stakeholders from across the Indo-Pacific region are invited to participate in this significant event.

Sri Lanka Ports Authority, together with the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation, seeks to transform the nation’s ports into efficient and sustainable facilities through a greening initiative.

The initiative aims to enhance energy efficiency by reducing waste and emissions, while promoting environmentally responsible shipping and transportation practices and developing renewable energy capabilities, including solar and wind energy production at the ports.

The private sector is poised to play a pivotal role in this transformation by providing services and equipment in support of port operations and the greening initiative.

In line with these sustainability goals, the global shipping sector is embracing carbon emissions reduction strategies, including the adoption of advanced technologies such as green methanol-fueled cargo ships and electric tugboats. Furthermore, electric gantry cranes, terminal tractors and other container-moving equipment are set to replace high-emission diesel versions to reduce port operators’ carbon footprint.
