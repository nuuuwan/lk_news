Sajith accuses AKD and Ranil of secret pact

Claims both Ranil Wickremesinghe and Anura Kumara Dissanayake are colluding to defeat him

Says the President has already conceded he cannot win at the elections

Accuses Wickremesinghe of acting as though he is Dissanayake’s private secretary

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Presidential candidate Sajith Premadasa has accused his rivals, President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Anura Kumara Dissanayake of the National People’s Power (NPP), of conspiring together through a secret pact.

Speaking at a rally in Talawakelle yesterday, Sajith Premadasa alleged that President Ranil Wickremesinghe is acting as though he is Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s private secretary, implying that Wickremesinghe and Anura Kumara Dissanayake have formed a secret political alliance.

Premadasa accused the pair of collaborating to mount a significant campaign aimed at defeating him in the upcoming election.

Premadasa accused Wickremesinghe of mimicking the promises he himself made on the campaign trail. “However, the President has admitted he cannot win,” Premadasa said. “It seems his only ambition now is to become Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s private secretary. That’s why they are employing various tactics and investing resources to defeat Sajith Premadasa,” he added.

He also accused Wickremesinghe of attempting to sell the Nuwara Eliya post office. In response, Premadasa pledged to improve the lives of those living in line rooms and unemployed youth in Nuwara Eliya by providing them with land and helping them become smallholder tea estate owners.

Meanwhile, Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) Leader Mano Ganesan addressing the rally said his party’s support for Premadasa is not driven by personal gain. Instead, he said, it is motivated by the desire to fulfil the hopes of the people. Ganesan emphasised that a Sajith Premadasa administration would represent a golden opportunity for the Malaiyaha Tamils in Sri Lanka.
