Sri Lanka to establish youth centres with bank executives and trade board members

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s President has said regional youth centres will be established in each divisional secretariat division in a bid to empower the youth demographic.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe promised “to nurture budding entrepreneurs through these centres, with intentions to engage bank executives and trade board members in the process,” at a meeting with young Members of Parliament and emerging political figures from the Nuwara Eliya district.

Sri Lanka has seen an exodus of young people after an economic crisis plunged a large part of the population into poverty.

Wickremesinghe “reiterated his commitment to fostering the region’s development into a premier tourist destination,” and pointed out that concerted efforts were imperative “to attract essential investments for national development,” in a statement by his media division.

His goal was “to ensure that these benefits reached every segment of society” Wickremesinghe was quoted as saying.

The young parliamentarians apprised the President of the challenges they encounter and presented their proposals pertaining to the nation’s development agenda. (Colombo/Apr19/2024)
