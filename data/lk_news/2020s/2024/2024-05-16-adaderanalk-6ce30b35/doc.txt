Heavy showers of about 100mm likely in several provinces

The Meteorology Department says the low-level atmospheric disturbance still persists in the vicinity of the island and therefore, the prevailing showery conditions are expected to continue further.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places in most provinces of the island after 1.00 p.m.

Heavy showers of about 100mm are likely at some places in Western, Central, Sabaragamuwa and Uva provinces.

Showers may occur in Western, Southern and Eastern coastal areas during the morning too, it said.

General public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
