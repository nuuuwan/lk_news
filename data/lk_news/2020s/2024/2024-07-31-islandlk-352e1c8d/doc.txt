Save the Sri Lankan Leopard: LOLC’s commitment to protect our apex predator

In celebration of National Leopard Day on August 1st, LOLC Holdings has launched several new initiatives to further its ongoing commitment to the conservation of the Sri Lankan leopard, in partnership with the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS).

The Sri Lankan leopard, an apex predator and a key component of the island’s rich biodiversity, faces escalating threats from unplanned land use, wildlife crimes, inadequate penalties, and limited ecological understanding. With rough estimates suggesting fewer than 1,000 individuals remaining in the country, the conservation of this endemic subspecies has become increasingly vital.

As part of this expanded effort, LOLC has introduced a new logo under the theme ‘Save the Sri Lankan Leopard,’ designed to raise awareness and foster public engagement. Resonating with both conservationists and the general public, the logo features a clean and powerful image of the leopard, emphasising the importance of protecting the Sri Lankan leopard and its habitat, aiming to inspire pride and support for conservation efforts.

Since February 2022, LOLC and WNPS have been implementing a comprehensive 5-year project to address the myriad challenges facing the Sri Lankan leopard. This initiative involves establishing a network of research centres across key locations in Sri Lanka to monitor leopard populations, enhance habitat suitability, and develop strategies for mitigating human-leopard conflicts. By integrating findings from past and ongoing research and facilitating data sharing, the project aims to create a robust, science-driven conservation strategy.
