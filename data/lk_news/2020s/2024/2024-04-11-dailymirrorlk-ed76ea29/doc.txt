Will import eggs from India again if local prices increase: Minister

The government will import eggs from India again if the local egg prices increase again, Trade Minister Nalin Fernando said.

He told the media that a slight price decrease was seen in the prices of eggs in the local market during the past few days, but the current price of an egg in the local market has increased up to Rs. 50.

It was reported that the higher demand for eggs has caused the price increase in the local market, the Minister added.
