Suspected deaths of patients at Kurunegala Hospital raise concern

Feb 24, (Daily Mirror) - The Health Ministry has launched an investigation and appointed a committee to look into the incident surrounding the suspected deaths at the dialysis unit of the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital.

Speaking of the matter, Secretary of the Ministry of Health Dr. Palitha Mahipala said the at least five deaths have occurred since January at the dialysis unit.

Accordingly, a five-member committee headed by Chief Epidemiologist Dr Samitha Ginige has been appointed to look into the matter.

According to sources, the incident may have occurred due to the entry of certain unidentified pathogens into the blood dialysis unit.
