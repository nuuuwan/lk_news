Uncertainty looms over Presidential Election date amidst IMF program and political demands

The preliminary arrangements required to hold the presidential election have been completed, according to the Election Commission.

Nevertheless, internal sources within the government revealed that President Ranil Wickremesinghe informed the Cabinet of Ministers and the Election Commission that no election will take place before the month of July, as the countryâ€™s debt restructuring programme under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will be in progress until July.

However, the Presidential Election is required to be held within this year, as per the Constitution.

Last week, reports claimed that the presidential election will possibly take place in the period between end-September to early-October this year.

Meanwhile, a member of the Election Commission stated that an amount of Rs. 10 billion has been allocated from the budget for holding the elections this year, and that all Assistant Election Commissioners have been informed regarding the preparation activities to hold the election.

The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) had requested the President to hold the general election before the presidential election and if so, the general election would have to be held before the month of August.
