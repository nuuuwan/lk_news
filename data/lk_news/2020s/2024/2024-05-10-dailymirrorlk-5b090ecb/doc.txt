Human traffickers sent over 80 Sri Lankan war veterans to Russian-Ukrainian war front: 8 killed

Colombo, May 10 (Daily Mirror) - Investigations have revealed that more than 80 Sri Lankan war veterans have been sent to the Russian-Ukrainian war front as members of mercenary groups by human traffickers.

Police Spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa said that among them, at least eight retired war veterans who had joined as mercenaries have died so far. He said six Sri Lankans had reportedly died in Russia and two had died in Ukraine.

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID), Police and Intelligence agencies have launched extensive operations to arrest illegal human traffickers and several people involved in a racket to send retired war veterans to the Russian-Ukrainian war front as members of mercenary groups.

DIG Thalduwa said illegal human traffickers reportedly sent 60 Sri Lankans to Russia and 23 to Ukraine to be deployed in the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

The CID on Wednesday arrested a retired Army Major General and a former Army Sergeant on charges of trafficking ex-military personnel to conflict zones in Ukraine.

The Ministry of Defence has also warned that a significant number of Sri Lankan war veterans who had joined as mercenaries have died or sustained injuries at the battlefield.

They said these war veterans have left for the Russian-Ukrainian war front as mercenaries after being duped by these human traffickers who had promised them an opportunity to join the foreign army, handsome salaries, citizenship in those countries and other benefits. However, neither the serving nor the injured have received any salaries or benefits and these traffickers have not even given any sort of compensation to the families of those injured or the dead.
