Colombo Plan Secretary General Dr. Benjamin P. Reyes recently met with Indian High Commissioner Santosh Jha to discuss collaboration.

Colombo Plan’s Port of Colombo Capacity Building Project Lead Consultant Rohan Masakorala joined the discussion as well.

They discussed the priorities of the Colombo Plan and opportunities for further collaboration. India plays a vital role in the development of the maritime and logistics sector in South Asia and is emerging as an economic power and is among the fastest growing economies of the world. These developments in India will propel the rest of South Asian economies with a multiplier effect on economic output and connectivity in South Asia. The Colombo Plan, being one of the oldest inter-governmental organisations, is now focusing on the important areas of the maritime and logistics sector to support its member countries to adopt the best practices and increase skills in the sector.
