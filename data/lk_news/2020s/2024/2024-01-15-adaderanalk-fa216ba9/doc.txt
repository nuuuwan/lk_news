10 Indian fishermen held for poaching in Sri Lankan waters off Point Pedro

During a special operation conducted to chase away Indian poaching trawlers from Sri Lankan waters last night (14), the Sri Lanka Navy has apprehended 10 Indian fishermen along with an Indian trawler after having spotted they were engaging in illegal fishing in Sri Lankan waters north of Point Pedro, Jaffna.

The Northern Naval Command which deployed an Inshore Patrol Craft to chase away a cluster of Indian poaching trawlers has held the Indian poaching trawler with the fishermen as they continued to remain in island waters off Point Pedro.

The 10 apprehended Indian fishermen and the poaching trawler were brought to the Kankasanthurai harbour and they will be handed over to the Mailadi Fisheries Inspector for onward legal action, the Navy said.

The Navy conducts regular patrols and operations in Sri Lankan waters to curb illegal fishing practices by foreign fishing trawlers, taking into account the consequences of these practices on the livelihood of local fishermen and the marine resources of the country.
