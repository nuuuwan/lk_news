Sri Lanka Telecom announces second leadership transition in seven months

Sri Lanka Telecom has seen its leadership change for the second time in about seven months with the entity affirming the appointment of a new Chairman.

The stressed state-owned telco, which has been making headlines this week for the changes in its Board, disclosed to the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) that upon the review and recommendation of the Nominations and Governance Committee, A.K.D.D.D. Arandara has been appointed as a Non-Independent Non-Executive Director and Chairman with effect from 1 February.

Earlier this week, Reyaz Mihular stepped down from his position as Chairman after the government said it would reconstitute the SLT Board. The decision was due to the latter refusing to withdraw the case against the proposed merger between industry leader Dialog Axiata and Airtel.
