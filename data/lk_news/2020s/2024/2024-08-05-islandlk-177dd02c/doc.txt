Digitalising water cycle:A pathway to sustainable management

At present, both the public and private organisations of Sri Lanka involved in the water sector are utilising digital technologies to a certain level to perform their tasks. Digitalising Sri Lanka’s water cycle to an advanced level is not without challenges like the need for significant investments in technological infrastructure and capacity building of the human resources employed. However, by harnessing the power of technology we can ensure the sustainable use of our water resources while minimising related issues and conflicts. Further, these technologies are vital for understanding how the water cycle is affected by climate change and for developing consequent adaptation strategies.

The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, is the constant movement and exchange of water between the atmosphere, land, and oceans. It involves several key processes: precipitation, evaporation, transpiration, runoff, and groundwater infiltration. At present, the world is harnessing digital technologies in many fields, and it is possible to digitise the water cycle of a country to ensure its sustainable management. It involves monitoring, modeling, and managing the various processes of the water cycle mentioned above using digital tools and technologies.

Sri Lanka too is at a pivotal juncture as a developing country where digital technologies could assist in sustainable management of water resources. As far as the large number of rivers, reservoirs ranging from minor to major, and complex water management systems like Mahaweli are concerned, it is crucial to get the help of these advanced technologies for effective and efficient water management. Not only domestic, agricultural, and industrial water requirements but even the environmental requirements can easily be assessed and served well by such advancements.

Digital transformation should focus on and improve how we monitor, manage, and optimise the water cycle. Sensors and remote sensing technologies for data collection, digital tools for data analysis, and operational techniques for water infrastructure can leverage entire water cycle management. This article discusses some of the digital technologies widely used in water cycle management worldwide.

GIS is primarily used for mapping and analysing spatial data related to water resources. For example, it can delineate catchments of reservoirs and rivers accurately and efficiently. In addition, it can generate crucial inputs for computer-aided water modeling. Identifying water pollution sources and their impacts on water bodies, and mapping flood-prone areas are some other activities that can be performed by GIS.

Remote sensing technologies that use satellites and aerial sensors are able to collect data without direct contact with physical objects. Using these technologies measuring real-time rainfall, monitoring changes in reservoir water levels, estimating evaporation, and calculating various indices related to crops and forests can be done. For example, the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is one of the important remote sensing indices. It assesses crop health and monitors plant growth, and optimizes irrigation schedules based on vegetation water stress enabling better water management preventing waste. Eventually, agricultural productivity can be enhanced.

Internet of Things (IoT) enables smarter, more connected, and more efficient systems. In terms of water cycle management, it has the potential to provide real-time data, improve water use efficiency, and enable smarter decision-making. These technologies are mainly used for managing large datasets, forecasting water demand, flood risks, and droughts by big data analysis, and assessing the impact of climate change on water resources by running climate models. IoT, combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), can develop more intelligent, autonomous, and efficient systems for water cycle management.

Mobile applications are good digital tools that can empower citizens to actively participate in water management efforts as stakeholders. People can use various applications for a wide range of purposes. For instance, the public can get emergency alerts and response plans during floods and farmers can be made aware of water allocation plans for their agricultural fields. Potable water users can inform relevant authorities of water leaks in supply lines preventing losses. Also, they can track consumption and manage daily usage using mobile apps to be economical. Another advantage is that water conservation practices can be dissimilated easily to the public to raise awareness with minimum cost involvement.

Today a large number of computational models developed by various firms are available. These are primarily utilised for modeling flood and drought risks, water quality, and water resources evaluation and allocation among other usages.

There are many Decision Support Systems that help authorities in charge, stakeholders and policymakers make informed and effective decisions. Thereby, complex issues related to water cycle management can be solved with less effort. For instance, gate operations of a multipurpose reservoir for flood control, water supply, and hydroelectric power generation can easily be managed with a decision support system. Further, these systems enhance the efficiency of water governance processes, ensuring that decisions are just and fair.

At present, both the public and private organisations of Sri Lanka involved in the water sector are utilising digital technologies to a certain level to perform their tasks. Digitalising Sri Lanka’s water cycle to an advanced level is not without challenges like the need for significant investments in technological infrastructure and capacity building of the human resources employed.
