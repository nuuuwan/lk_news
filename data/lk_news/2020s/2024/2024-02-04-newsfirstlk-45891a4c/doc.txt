Cardinal calls for a transition to new leadership in Sri Lanka

COLOMBO (News 1st) – Archbishop of Colombo His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith has called for a transition to new leadership in Sri Lanka.

Cardinal Ranjith highlighted the contrasting approaches taken by Singapore and Sri Lanka after independence. While Singapore's leaders prioritized unity and the well-being of all communities, he decried the division sowed by Sri Lankan leadership based on language and religion.

He further praised Singapore's strong legal system and emphasis on discipline, contrasting them with the perceived disregard for law and order in Sri Lanka.

The Cardinal accused the government of self-serving agendas and prioritizing personal gain over the nation's well-being. He questioned the legitimacy of their "independence celebrations" at a time of economic and political turmoil, suggesting that they only celebrate their own freedom, not that of the suffering people.

He urged the nation to "free itself from the clutches of this oppressive ruling class" and elect leaders who genuinely love and respect the country and its diverse population.

He said: "I honestly believe that we should drive out these corrupt leaders and bring in new leadership who love the country, and respect the religions and culture of our country."
