ECONOMYNEXT – Washington-based International Monetary Fund has approved a review of Sri Lanka’s program, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry said.

“This achievement is a testament to our dedication to driving forward economic reforms and securing a prosperous future for all Sri Lankans,” Minister Sabry said in an x.com (twitter) post.

IMF's approved the 2nd review of Sri Lanka’s program. This achievement is a testament to our dedication to driving forward economic reforms and securing a prosperous future for all Sri Lankans. Onward and upward! 🇱🇰 #Progress #SriLanka #IMF

The IMF had earlier said Sri Lanka had made “sufficient progress” on debt restructuring for a review on June 12, despite final deals pending with bilateral creditors and private creditors.

Upto now the central bank has provided monetary stability, allowing people to stagger out of the worst currency crisis in the history of the agency.

Economic growth has also started to recover, despite reserve collection (exporting capital or savings), as the agency had allowed the exchange rate to appreciate amid deflationary policy, temporarily keeping inflation below its 5-7 percent target.

The approval will provide about 300 million US dollars to the Treasury. (Colombo/June12/2024)
