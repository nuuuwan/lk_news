Sri Lanka EC becomes flexible on poll closing

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Election Commission has decided to allow all the voters who have arrived at 4 pm to their respective polling booths to cast their votes instead of closing the polling booths at that time, Commissioner General of Election said.

“Instead of closing polling at 4 pm we have decided to allow all those who will line up at their respective polling booths to cast their votes,” Saman Sri Ratnayaka, the Commissioner General of Election, told Economy Next.

“There could be situations where voters turning to their polling booth late because of work and some other issues specially in plantation areas. So one polling booth officer will stand in the line at 4 pm and all the voters who have lined up before the officer will be allowed to cast their votes.”

“However, people who arrive at the polling booth after 4 pm or who join the line behind the officer will not be allowed.”

A record 17.1 million voters are eligible to choose Sri Lanka’s ninth leader among an unprecedented 38 candidates. The voting started at 0700 hours local time in 13,421 polling stations across the country. (Colombo/September 21/2024)
