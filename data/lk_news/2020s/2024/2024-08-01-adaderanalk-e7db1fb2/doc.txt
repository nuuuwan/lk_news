Drug kingpins ‘Kanjipani Imran’ and ‘Rotumbe Amila’ arrested in Russia – sources

The notorious organised criminal figures and large-scale drug traffickers infamously known as “Kanjipani Imran” and Amila Sepala Ratnayake alias “Rotumbe Amila” have reportedly been arrested in Russia.

However, Sri Lankan authorities have not been officially informed regarding the matter, as per sources. Accordingly, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has reportedly requested Interpol to confirm the matter.

Organised criminals “Kanjipani Imran” and “Rotumbe Amila”, were earlier arrested in Dubai along with drug kingpin “Makandure Madush”, who was later shot dead in Sri Lanka allegedly during the cross-fire between police officers and another suspected criminal gang. The duo, who were deported to Sri Lanka, had later fled the country again after being granted bail by the court.

Meanwhile, the police suspected that “Kanjipani Imran” was also involved in the murder of “Club Wasantha” as the bullets used in the shooting incident were marked as “KPI”. Furthermore, police said that Amila Sepala Ratnayake alias “Rotumbe Amila” was also accused of aiding and abetting the murder.

Earlier today, it was reported that the main suspect in the killing of ‘Club Wasantha’ at Athurugiriya, Sujeewa Ruwankumara alias ‘Loku Patty’ has been arrested in Belarus.

Additionally, the brother of ‘Loku Patty’, Sanjeewa Pushpakumara de Silva, and the drug kingpin Mervin Jaana’s wife have also been arrested in Belarus along with the suspect, according to police sources.

Accordingly, it is reported that the police have already commenced necessary arrangements to repatriate ‘Loku Patty’ to Sri Lanka as soon as possible.

Police stated that all these suspects were wanted by the police over various criminal charges.
