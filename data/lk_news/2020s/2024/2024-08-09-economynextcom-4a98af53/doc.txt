ADB working on Sri Lanka $100mn tourism sector loan

ECONOMYNEXT – Manila-based Asian Development Bank is working on a 100 million US dollar tourism sector loan for Sri Lanka, Country Director Takafumi Kadono said.

The loan will be made up of a 70 million dollar budget support component, and a 30 million dollar project, he said.

Earlier this year ADB brought together government officials and also industry representatives and bio-diversity experts in a knowledge sharing event.

The lender will “support policy actions in the tourism sector to increase resilience to shocks and strengthen institutions, and potentially streamline decision making” Kadono said at the time.

Sri Lanka is facing the prospect of overtourism in some areas including the Yala national park while there were also concerns over certain whale watching practices, some experts said.

The ADB has already provided loans to Sri Lanka its in economic recovery efforts.

The agency has just approved the release of a 100 million dollar loan linked to electricity reforms.

A 200 dollar loan linked to financial sector reform and a 100 million dollar loan linked to water reform are also in the works. (Colombo/Aug09/2024)
