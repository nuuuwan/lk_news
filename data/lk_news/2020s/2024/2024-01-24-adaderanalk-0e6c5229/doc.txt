NIC number to be converted to TIN?

State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya has stated that measures are underway to convert a personâ€™s National Identity Card (NIC) number to their Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).

Speaking to the media today (24 Jan.), the State Minister explained that the matter was discussed, at length, at the Presidential Secretariat on Tuesday (23 Jan.) with the participation of several relevant authorities.

He stated that the relevant decision was taken after a general consensus was reached that the process of obtaining a TIN must not be yet another burden on the public.
