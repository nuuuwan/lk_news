Sajith denies possibility of alliance with defeated President Ranil Wickremesinghe

Premadasa to be SJB’s Prime Ministerial candidate on agreement with all parties in SJS

Says alliance between him and Wickremesinghe could be successful based on “arithmetic,” but deeper political analysis would reveal otherwise

Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa announced his readiness to contest the upcoming General Elections, confirming that he will run as the leader of the Samagi Jana Balavega (SJB) and Samagi Jana Sandhanaya (SJS).

Premadasa emphasised his willingness to join forces with progressive groups who align with the party’s principles and are committed to serving the people.

During a meeting held in Colombo with Members of Parliament, district, and constituency organisers of the SJB and Samagi Jana Sandhanaya, the group unanimously agreed to entrust Premadasa with the responsibility of leading the coalition as their Prime Ministerial candidate in the upcoming elections.

Addressing the media, Premadasa remarked that there had been false rumours circulating in recent days, and he urged the public to critically assess the information disseminated by both traditional and social media.

Premadasa clarified that there had been no discussions with figures such as Ranil Wickremesinghe. While some might speculate that an alliance between him and Wickremesinghe could be successful based on “arithmetic,” Premadasa argued that a deeper political analysis would reveal otherwise.

He pledged to humbly accept the will and blessings of the people as reflected in the elections.

Premadasa also addressed recent comments by Wickremesinghe, stating that the former President has indicated he will not be contesting in the General Election.

Despite the challenging situation the country faces, Premadasa reaffirmed his commitment to the democratic process, calling for the creation of a “clean government” built on transparency and principles.

In a strong statement, Premadasa rejected decision-making behind closed doors and reaffirmed the SJB’s dedication to protecting democracy. He added that, regardless of whether he holds power, his focus remains on the people and adding value to the country.

The upcoming general election, expected later this year, will be a key test for the SJB and its allies, as they position themselves as a major force in Sri Lankan politics.
