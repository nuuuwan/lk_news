WORX Coworking unveils 4th property in Colombo

In response to the growing demand for flexible workspaces, WORX Coworking has announced the inauguration of its latest coworking facility situated at No. 14 Gower Street, Colombo 05.

As a frontrunner in providing innovative workspace solutions, WORX Coworking continues to redefine the professional landscape by expanding its footprint in the city.

Strategically situated in a convenient Colombo neighbourhood, the Gower Street location marks WORX Coworking’s 4th property, reflecting its commitment to catering to the diverse needs of professionals in Sri Lanka. The state-of-the-art facility is strategically positioned to meet the demands of a dynamic workforce seeking flexible, inspiring environments.

WORX Coworking Director Azahn Munas said: “Our commitment goes beyond providing workspaces; it’s about cultivating a hub for creativity, innovation, and meaningful connections. Whether you’re a photographer, content creator, or a digital nomad, WORX Gower Street offers an unparalleled environment to elevate your work.”

The sleek and modern design of WORX Gower Street is an inspiring backdrop for various creative endeavours. The facility includes a mix of private offices, executive suites, a 12-seater boardroom, kitchen space, large indoor communal spaces and outdoor garden spaces as well as onsite and reserved street parking. A standout feature is the 12-seater boardroom, equipped with cutting-edge technology for seamless communication and collaboration.

Munas highlighted the overwhelming popularity of WORX Coworking spaces, stating, “All our spaces are 100% occupied, with a 6-month waitlist. The Gower Street location even sold out before launch, featuring a new concept, executive suites, tailored for CEOs and senior management, which garnered immense popularity.”

Maintaining a hospitality-driven vibe, WORX Coworking aims to differentiate itself by transforming the colonial charm of the Gower Street property into an inviting workspace. Azahn emphasised, “We don’t like our spaces to feel corporate or like a typical commercial office space; instead, we create intimate locations with a sense of hospitality and a leisurely vibe. The Gower Street space is adorned with more art and creative works, providing an ideal backdrop for photo shoots.”

WORX Coworking has consistently led in redefining workspace solutions. The Gower Street location, with its strategic location, premium amenities, and contemporary design, is poised to become a sought-after destination for individuals and businesses seeking a distinctive and inspiring workspace and photoshoot location.

With unique versatility and adaptability, WORX Coworking has quickly become a favourite among photographers, couples, and brands looking for the perfect backdrop to their stories or to create compelling visual narratives. The organisation focuses on workspaces that don’t just provide desks and chairs but inspiring workplaces that are lively, engaging and vibrant, making it one of Colombo’s most sought-after destinations for both wedding pre-shoots and branded photoshoots.

With a focus on creating communities and facilitating connections, WORX Coworking said it remains dedicated to supporting local startups and enterprises.
