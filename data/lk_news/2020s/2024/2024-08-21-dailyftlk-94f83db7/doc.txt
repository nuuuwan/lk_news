The Chamber of Young Lankan Entrepreneurs (COYLE) has announced the launch of its latest initiative, the Young Lankan’s program.

This youth development project is designed to foster entrepreneurship among the next generation, empowering young minds across Sri Lanka to become the driving force behind the nation’s economic growth. As the world rapidly evolves, COYLE recognises the need to invest in the youth of today to secure a prosperous future for tomorrow.

The Young Lankan’s program is a collaborative effort by COYLE to tap into the immense potential of young people across the island. By targeting the youth, COYLE aims to unlock opportunities for innovation and enterprise that will not only benefit individuals but also contribute significantly to the national economy. This initiative goes beyond mere encouragement; it seeks to actively cultivate a culture of entrepreneurship by providing mentorship, inspiration, and the essential training required to succeed in the business world.

At the core of the Young Lankan’s program is a robust mentorship framework, where seasoned entrepreneurs and COYLE members will play a pivotal role in guiding young entrepreneurs on their journey to success. This approach ensures that the wisdom and experience of veteran businessmen are passed down to the next generation, offering invaluable insights that can help young entrepreneurs navigate the complexities of starting and growing a business.

Youth development has always been a fundamental goal of COYLE, and the launch of the Young Lankan’s program is a testament to this commitment. By engaging with the younger generation, COYLE is not only fostering individual success but also laying the groundwork for a more vibrant and resilient economy.

The Young Lankan’s program marks a significant step in COYLE’s ongoing mission to promote entrepreneurship and economic growth in Sri Lanka. By equipping young people with the tools, knowledge, and support they need, COYLE is helping to shape a future where innovation and enterprise are at the heart of the nation’s progress. As this program takes root, the Chamber looks forward to seeing the emergence of a new generation of leaders who will drive Sri Lanka towards a brighter, more prosperous future.
