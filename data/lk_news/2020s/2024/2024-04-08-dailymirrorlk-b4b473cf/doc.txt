Tissa cautions SJB Leadership on whom to associate with

Colombo, April 8 (Daily Mirror) - Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) National Organizer Tissa Attanayake over the weekend cautioned his leader Sajith Premadasa on whom the party should associate with.

“SJB should not associate with those who shift sides, and those who are corrupt but with those who are clean and trusted by the people,” Mr. Attanayake told journalists referring to the MoU with the party signed with a group of MPs from Nidahas Janatha Balawegaya (NJB) on Friday.

“SJB working committee gave power to party leader to allay with any party. Therefore, we are not against any alliance with the NJB. However, we caution the party leader on whom the party should associate with as any alliance will not be accepted by the people if we are to associate with wrong the people,” Attanayake added.

“The MoU with the group of NJB MPs was signed in a hurry. That is why many SJB members were not aware. I was also engaged in another appointment. That is why I missed it,” he also said.

Many SJB seniors were absent during the signing ceremony on Friday. The situation was same with the NJB.
