Serendib Flour Mills, fuelled with the purpose of nourishing the nation, launched its new ‘Serendib Adhi Shakthi Fortified Wheat Flour’ – a micronutrient-fortified wheat flour exclusively aimed at plantation communities in Kandy recently.

Introduced in November last year, the new Serendib Adhi Shakthi flour contains essential nutrients such as Iron, Folic Acid, and Vitamin B12, and is tailored to meet the nutritional needs of estate communities, mainly to address key nutritional deficiencies and the rising incidence of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs).

Serendib Flour Mills working in collaboration with the Plantation Human Development Trust (PHDT), launched the product at the Golden Crown Hotel, Kandy amidst a distinguished presence of guests including PHDT Chairman Barath Arulsamy, Director General Lal Perera and Mahesh Wanigasuriya Regional Director Kandy.
