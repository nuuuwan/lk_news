Damitha Abeyratne and husband remanded

Actress Damitha Abeyratne and her husband, who was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) over an alleged financial fraud, has been remanded on the orders of the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court.

Accordingly, the couple will be behind bars on remand until April 17.

The actress and her spouse, who had been wanted by the CID, were arrested after they appeared before the court on Thursday (04).

The CID is investigating Abeyratne and her husband, in connection with their involvement in an alleged money scam.

The Computer Crimes Division of the CID had initiated an investigation into the alleged defrauding of Rs. 3 million by the couple on the promise of employment in South Korea. Subsequently, the CID informed the court that Abeyratne and her husband would be named as suspects of the relevant case.

Accordingly, Fort Magistrate’s Court recently rejected a writ petition filed seeking to prevent their arrest.

Meanwhile, Fort Magistrate Thilina Gamage imposed an overseas travel ban on the couple on Wednesday (03), with respect to the incident.
