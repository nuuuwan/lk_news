Diana’s expulsion case postponed

Colombo, May 10 (Daily Mirror)-The expulsion petition filed by former State Minister Diana Gamage challenging the Samagi Jana Balawegaya’s (SJB) decision to expel her from party membership was today fixed for May 28 by the Supreme Court.

Diana Gamage’s stance regarding this petition is to be informed to the court on the next date.

Accordingly, the Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Justices Gamini Amarasekara, Kumuduni Wickremasinghe and Mahinda Samayawardena fixed the matter for May 28.

However, the Supreme Court, in another application held that Diana Gamage is disqualified to be a Member of Parliament and thus she is not entitled to hold office as a Member of Parliament, as she was not a citizen of Sri Lanka.

In her petition, Diana Gamage is seeking a declaration that the decision to expel her from the SJB communicated to her via letter dated 08th October 2021, is made in violation of the constitution of the SJB. Gamage stated that the party decision to expel her from party membership was unlawful and contrary to natural justice. Diana Gamage said she has been expelled from the party membership following her decision to vote in favour of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution. The petitioner said she is not a member of the Government, but a Member of Parliament acting with independence and in accordance with her conscience as demanded by the  SJB’s constitution.

Diana Gamage has cited SJB General Secretary, its Chairman Sajith Premadasa, Secretary General of Parliament, the Chairman of the Election Commission, members of the Election Commission and several others as respondents.

She further seeks a declaration that the conduct of the purported disciplinary inquiry is in violation of natural justice and procedural properties, and thereby null and void and has no force or avail in law.
