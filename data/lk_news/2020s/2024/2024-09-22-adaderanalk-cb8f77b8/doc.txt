Ali Sabry and Harsha congratulate Anura Kumara

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Parliamentarian Dr. Harsha de Silva has congratulated the National People’s Power (NPP) presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

In a post on ‘X’ (formerly Twitter), the former Deputy Minister said they campaigned hard for SJB’s presidential candidate Sajith Premadasa, and that however “it was not to be”.

“It is now clear Anura Kumara Dissanayake will be the new President of SriLanka.”

Dr. de Silva stated that in the spirit of democracy and goodwill he called and wished Dissanayake the best in the “arduous road ahead”.

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka’s Foreign Minister Ali Sabry has also extended his best wishes to NPP candidate Dissanayake.

“After a long and arduous campaign, the results of the election are now clear. Though I heavily campaigned for President Ranil Wickremasinghe, the people of Sri Lanka have made their decision, and I fully respect their mandate for Anura Kumara Dissanayake. In a democracy, it is crucial to honor the will of the people, and I do so without hesitation.

I extend my sincere congratulations to Mr. Dissanayake and his team. Leading a country is no easy task, and I genuinely hope that their leadership brings Sri Lanka the peace, prosperity, and stability it so deeply deserves. The challenges they will face are immense, and I trust they will reflect on the lessons of the past—both the successes and failures of those who have held power before them. History teaches us that the real challenge is not in winning an election, but in governing wisely and staying true to the needs of the people.

Too often, those who have won elections in the past lost sight of the promises they made and missed the opportunity to bring real change. I hope Mr. Dissanayake and his team learn from these past mistakes and lead with a commitment to transparency, integrity, and the long-term good of the country.

I wish Mr. Dissanayake and his team every success in their efforts to lead Sri Lanka forward.”
