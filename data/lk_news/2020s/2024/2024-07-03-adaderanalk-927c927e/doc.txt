Bodies of fishermen who died after drinking from bottle found in sea brought to Tangalle

The bodies of four fishermen, who died after consuming the contents of a bottle they found floating in the sea assuming it was liquor, were brought to the Tangalle fisheries harbour this morning (03).

The fishing vessel “Devon 05,” which had also suffered a mechanical failure, was towed to the Tangalle Fisheries Harbour by another vessel.

According to Tangalle police, the bodies were kept on the vessel pending the arrival of the magistrate for a magisterial inquest.

Following the magistrate’s inquiry, the bodies will be transferred to Tangalle Hospital for the post-mortem examinations.
