Signing of MoU between ACCA and the CSE

The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) and the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) recently to establish a partnership aimed at enhancing financial literacy and professional development in Sri Lanka, A CSE news release issued last week said.

“This collaboration intends to offer ACCA educational courses via CSE branches, which will entail a Capital Market Module; co-brand the educational courses with ACCA and CSE as well as provide access to ACCA professional development and learning resources. The partnership will explore and create new pathways for students to further their education and enhance their careers in accountancy and finance through joint marketing activities at regional levels. The initiative also aims to enhance the employability of students through capacity-building initiatives, it said.

The MoU was signed by Ms. Nilusha Ranasinghe, Head of South Asia, ACCA, and Mr. Rajeeva Bandaranaike, CEO, CSE. The signing ceremony was attended by Ms. Ruchera Jayawardena, Business Development Manager, ACCA; Ms. Dilani Perera, Business Relationship Manager, ACCA; Mr. Niroshan Wijesundere, Senior Vice President – Marketing, CSE; Ms. Uthpala Dissanayake, Legal Officer – Legal and Enforcement, CSE; and Ms. Lankesha Molligoda, Senior Vice President – Legal, Enforcement and Compliance, CSE.

Speaking on the partnership, Mr. Bandaranaike, said, “Improving financial literacy has a direct impact on financial markets. Hesitancy to enter the capital market often stems from a lack of understanding. Partnerships like this are vital in providing valuable information and knowledge, making it readily available to those interested. We welcome this initiative, as it benefits both our institutions and the industries we serve.”

Ms. Ranasinghe stated, “At ACCA, we believe that collaboration is the cornerstone of progress. This partnership with CSE is a testament to our unwavering dedication to supporting the national agenda and contributing to the economic resilience of Sri Lanka. We look forward to a fruitful and impactful collaboration with CSE, and we are confident that this MOU will pave the way for many successful initiatives in the years to come.”
