Bakery owners slash bread prices by Rs. 10 after Trade Minister’s ultimatum

The All Ceylon Bakery Owners’ Association yesterday announced that the price of a 450g loaf of bread is reduced by Rs. 10 effective from last night.

The decision follows Trade Minister Nalin Fernando’s ultimatum to bakery owners earlier this week, urging them to lower their prices.

Minister Fernando emphasised that the directive was clearly communicated to bakery owners, warning that non-compliance would lead to repercussions.

He stated that it was unfair for consumers to pay higher prices for bread, prompting the Government to take action to ensure affordability.
