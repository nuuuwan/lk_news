HC freezes two luxury apartments purchased by Keheliyaâ€™s son

The Colombo High Court has issued an order preventing the use of two luxury apartments located in the Colpetty area which had been purchased by Ramith Rambukwella, the son of former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella.

The two luxury apartments had allegedly been purchased for Rs. 80 million and Rs. 65 million.

The order was issued today (19) by Colombo High Court Judge Manjula Thilakaratne after considering a request from the Bribery Commission.

The Bribery Commission informed the court that Mr. Ramith Rambukwella had purchased two apartments from an apartment complex located in Colpetty for Rs. 80 million and Rs. 65 million respectively.

The commission requested the court today to issue an order to prohibit the property from being used or accessed as an investigation is being carried out in this regard, as part of an investigation against former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella.

The High Court Judge, who considered the request, issued an order preventing the use of two luxury apartments until December 19.
