Dialog launches trilingual Sayuru App to support Sri Lankan fishing communities

In a continued effort to empower Sri Lanka’s fishing communities, Dialog Axiata PLC, the country’s #1 connectivity provider, has launched the Sayuru mobile app, available in Sinhala, Tamil, and English. Designed for day-boat fishermen, the app offers real-time weather updates and other essential services, in partnership with the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and the Department of Meteorology.

Building on the success of the SMS and voice-based Sayuru service introduced in 2020, the enhanced app includes features such as ‘Today’s Weather,’ ‘Mark My Route,’ ‘Saved Locations,’ ‘Department Services,’ ‘Awareness Programmes,’ a digital compass, SOS alerts, and a fuel calculator. While the Sayuru SMS and voice service remains free, the app provides a 90-day trial for the new features, followed by a daily subscription fee of Rs. 2 + tax. The app can be downloaded for free from the Google Play Store, and Dialog customers can access it without incurring data charges.
