Cabinet green lights to enter into implementation agreement for Sustainable Consumption and Production Project

The Cabinet of Ministers approved entering into an Implementation Agreement between the Environment Ministry and the German Development Corporation to advance sustainable practices.

The agreement is a key step in obtaining technical assistance under the “Sustainable Consumption and Production Promotion Project.”

The initiative aligns with the 7th Sustainable Development Goal identified by the United Nations, focusing on “Ensuring Sustainable Production and Consumption Patterns.” The project aims to promote sustainable public procurement practices following national policies. It is poised to pave the way for the effective implementation of environmentally conscious policies and practices, reinforcing Sri Lanka’s dedication to achieving sustainable development goals and contributing to global efforts for a more sustainable future.

To realise this goal, Sri Lanka has developed the National Green Procurement Policy, which formally incorporates green components into the public procurement process. Additionally, a National Framework on Environmental Labelling has been established to facilitate the identification of reliable green products and services, aiming to curb false greening in the market.

The Cabinet of Ministers has already given its approval for these crucial measures.

Under the “Sustainable Consumption and Production Promotion Project,” the German Development Cooperation has committed to providing technical support for the planned programs. This collaborative effort mirrors similar initiatives underway in various Asian countries, emphasising a shared commitment to fostering sustainable practices in consumption and production.
