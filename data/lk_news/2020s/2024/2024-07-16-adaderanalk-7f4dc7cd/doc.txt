Railway station masters and teacher-principal unions to decide on strike actions

The Railway Station Masters’ Union says they will decide today (16) on the future course of trade union actions to be taken concerning their demands.

President of the union Sumedha Somaratne stated that despite authorities’ promises, no proper solutions have been found.

The union had previously temporarily halted their strike based on assurances that their issues would be presented to the Cabinet.

However, with no attention given to their demands by the Cabinet yesterday (15), the union will meet this morning to determine their next steps, he said.

Meanwhile, the Ceylon Teachers’ Union (CTU) has announced potential future trade union actions due to unresolved demands of teachers and principals.

CTU chairman Priyantha Fernando warned that if strikes occur, the government will be held responsible.

“The President is trying to disrupt the trade union actions by making various threats. We will certainly implement this in the school system, including massive protests, large agitations. We say that this situation should not be allowed to escalate to the point of strikes...” he said.
