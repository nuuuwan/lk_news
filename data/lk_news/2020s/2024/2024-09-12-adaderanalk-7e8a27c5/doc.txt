Anura Kumara commits to expanding the country’s economy

The Presidential Candidate of the National People’s Power (NPP), Anura Kumara Dissanayake says that steps will be taken under his government to expand the country’s economy.

Dissanayake made these comments while addressing a public rally held in the Mahaiyawa area of Kandy.

He further added that the country’s economy is currently constrained and lacking in growth.

He also stated that they are committed to expanding the economy and developing a society that works in all its assigned areas, including significant improvements in education.

“That’s the country... do you not want a country like that? That is what we are leading,” he said, adding that it is not something an ‘immature’ individual like Sajith Premadasa can accomplish.

Dissanayake also accused Premadasa of making promises about what he will give people wherever he goes.

“If someone like him were in your village, would you elect them to the local council? No, right? Ranil Wickramasinghe always makes fun of him. Think about this... postal voting took place on 4, 5 and 6. On (September) 03, they say that salaries will be increased. Isn’t that a mockery?” he questioned.

The NPP leader further said that after attending a rally in Yapahuwa, Sajith had made promises about distributing Muriate of Potash (Bandi Pohora) fertilizer for free after the SJB’s victory in September.

However, with the Yala harvest season now already over, it is considered too late for ‘Bandi Pohora’, which is actually required in February. “He will be at home by then.”

“We are ready to take over the country...to recover the country,” he said.
