We donâ€™t need intermediaries to meet IMF team: Hadunnetti

Colombo, March 12 (Daily Mirror)- Claiming that they were not ready to meet IMF delegation through any intermediaries, former JVP MP Sunil Hadunnetti said today the National People's Power (NPP) was scheduled to meet the high level IMF delegation this Thursday (14) following a request made by the IMF team.

He told a news conference of the NPP Economic Council that the IMF team has sought a meeting with the NPP and they will meet the NPP members at the JVP headquarters this Thursday.

"We did not attend the meeting convened by President Ranil Wickremesinghe with the IMF team. We had not sought such a meeting through the President. The meeting was arranged following a request made by SJB MP Harsha De Silva in Parliament. If we wanted any discussions with the IMF team or the IMF team wanted to discuss with us, there is a procedure to do so. We do not want intermediaries," he said.

Hadunnetti said the government discussed the agreement with the IMF team behind closed doors and got it approved without Parliamentary approval and the government wants the opposition to join the discussions now when the situation gets worse.

He said the NPP will continue the discussions with the IMF on matters they had discussed on previous occasions and said that the NPP had already conveyed its stance to the IMF team.
