Petition challenging IGP Tennakoon’s appointment fixed for consideration

The Supreme Court on Friday (March 15) fixed a petition filed against the appointment of IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon to be taken up for consideration on April 02.

The petition had been filed by Prof. Savitri Gunasekara earlier this month.

When the petition was called before a 3-member Supreme Court judge bench led by Justice Preethi Padman Surasena, the petitioning party was ordered to send notices to the respondents.

Subsequently, the petition was fixed for consideration on April 02.

The petitioner has sought a Supreme Court ruling invalidating the appointment of the police chief.

The Speaker of Parliament, the members of the Constitutional Council, IGP Tennakoon and several others have been named as the respondents of the petition.

Earlier this month, His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, the Young Journalists’ Association, the Centre for Policy Alternatives, Niroshan Padukka of Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) also put forward petitions, challenging the appointment of IGP Tennakoon.
