SLPP MP crosses over to SJB

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MP Dr. Thilak Rajapakshe extended his support to the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) yesterday.

The MP representing the Padiyathalawa electorate officially joined the SJB during the party’s latest Sakwala program held at a school in Ampara. The event was also attended by SJB leader Sajith Premadasa.

Veteran politician and former Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Anuradhapura district MP Tissa Karaliyadda also officially joined the SJB recently.

SJB leader and Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa appointed Karalliyadde as the co-organiser for the SJB’s Medawachchiya electorate.

Karaliyadda entered Parliament representing the Anuradhapura district and has served as the Cabinet Minister for Child Development and Women’s Affairs, as well as the Minister of Indigenous Medicine. The veteran politician found himself embroiled in controversy in 2015 when a photograph of him alongside underworld figure Iron Ranasinghe, alias SF Loku Malli, a prime suspect in the murder of nightclub owner Wasantha de Zoysa, went viral. At the time Karaliyadda denied any connection to Ranasinghe and the murder of de Zoysa in Anuradhapura.
