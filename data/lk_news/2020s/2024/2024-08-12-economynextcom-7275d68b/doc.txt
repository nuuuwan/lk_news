Sri Lanka Parliament informs Election Commission of two vacant seats

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Parliament has informed the Election Commission that two Parliamentary seats are vacant.

Acting General Secretary of the Parliament Chaminda Kularatne informed the Chairman of the Election Commission in writing that two Parliamentary seats in the Ninth Parliament have become vacant from August 9.

This is due to the cancellation of parliamentary seats of legislators Manusha Nanayakkara and Harin Fernando after the Supreme Court determined that the Samagi Jana Balawegaya’s (SJB) decision to expel the two was legally valid.

Galle District Member of Parliament Nanayakkara and National List Member of Parliament Harin Fernando had challeged the SJB’s decision to remove them from their party membership after the two crossed over to support President Ranil Wickremesinghe. (Colombo/Aug12/2024)
