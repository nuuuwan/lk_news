Cabinet clears publication of revised Immigration Bill

The Cabinet of Ministers has approved the publication of the draft Bill for the new Immigration Act in the Government Gazette, while subsequently presenting it to Parliament for approval.

The Immigration Act No. 20 of 1948 has undergone several amendments over the years. However, in light of rapid technological advancements and evolving international trends, there is a recognised need for a comprehensive overhaul.

On 15 February 2021, the Cabinet initially approved the introduction of a new Immigration Act to address these changes.

“The draft Bill, prepared by the Legal Draftsman, has now received clearance from the Attorney General,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

This new legislation aims to modernise the legal framework governing immigration in Sri Lanka, ensuring it is aligned with current and future demands.

The proposal to this effect submitted by Public Security Minister Tiran Alles was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
