Working committee to develop framework to establish National Quality Council

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the formation of a working committee tasked with developing and implementing the framework to establish the National Quality Council.

The committee will comprise representatives from relevant line ministries and national quality institutions.

The decision follows recommendations outlined in the National Quality Policy presented in 2016, the National Quality Infrastructure Strategy 2018-2022, and the National Export Strategy 2018-2022.

Currently, the National Quality Institute and various national quality regulatory agencies operate independently under different line ministries. The proposed National Quality Council seeks to integrate these entities, streamlining operations and improving the overall quality standards across industries.

The establishment of the council is expected to boost Sri Lankaâ€™s efforts to enhance product quality and ensure compliance with international standards and export capabilities.
