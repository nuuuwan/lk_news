Wimal Weerawansa acquitted from passport discrepancy case

National Freedom Front (NFF) leader MP Wimal Weerawansa has been acquitted from the passport case by the Negombo Magistrateâ€™s Court, Ada Derana reporter said.

In 2015, Weerawansa was accused of using an expired passport to fly abroad while the MP was preparing to travel to Europe for a series of lectures, following an invitation from Sri Lankan expatriates in Dubai and Italy.

However, the MP had claimed that upon arriving at the airport he realized that the passport in his possession was one that he had lost and later found after obtaining a new passport.
