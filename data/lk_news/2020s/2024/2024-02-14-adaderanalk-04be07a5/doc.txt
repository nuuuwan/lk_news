Sri Lanka committed to pursue reconciliation through domestic institutions - Sabry

Sri Lanka will pursue tangible progress on reconciliation and human rights through domestic institutions while maintaining its constructive engagement with the United Nations, Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabry said on Tuesday (Feb.13).

The lawmaker chaired the inaugural session of the Inter-Ministerial Standing Committee on Human Rights at the Foreign Affairs Ministry.

Addressing the meeting, Sabry highlighted that establishment of the Inter-Ministerial Standing Committee on Human Rights demonstrates the commitment of the Sri Lankan government to upholding human rights, fostering reconciliation, and ensuring the fulfillment of its voluntary international obligations.

He asserted that Sri Lanka will continue to engage constructively with the United Nations and remains committed to pursuing tangible progress on reconciliation and human rights through domestic institutions while preserving its sovereignty.

Foreign Secretary Aruni Wijewardane, addressing the meeting, underscored the importance of the Inter-Ministerial Standing Committee as a standing national framework to effectively coordinate the government’s response to an increasing volume of reporting obligations to the UN human rights mechanisms including to the Human Rights Council (HRC), the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), Special Procedures Mandate Holders (SPMHs) and Treaty Bodies.

Secretary Wijewardane provided an overview of the structure of the Inter-Ministerial Standing Committee which operates as a two-tier process, consisting of 21 government line agencies.

The United Nations and Human Rights Division provided an update on the status of reporting obligations under the international human rights conventions to which Sri Lanka is a party.

The Inter-Ministerial Standing Committee (IMSC) on Human Rights, established pursuant to approval of the Cabinet of Ministers on 11 December 2023, is envisaged as a standing national framework to ensure efficient coordination and reporting on Sri Lanka’s voluntary international commitments regarding human rights and reconciliation.

The IMSC operates as a two-tier process. The first tier is the high-level Committee chaired by Minister of Foreign Affairs which is convened every four months as needed and makes policy decisions on matters of high priority and significance. The second tier is the senior official level Committee, chaired by Foreign Secretary which monitors progress and meets on a monthly basis as required.

During the discussion that followed the presentation, the officials who attended the meeting appreciated this initiative of the Foreign Ministry and expressed their willingness to cooperate in this process.
