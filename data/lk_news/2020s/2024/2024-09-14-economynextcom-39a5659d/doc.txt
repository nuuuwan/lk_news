Sri Lanka Treasury cashflows to finance Rs58.5bn auction shortfall

ECONOMYNEXT – A 58.5 billion rupee auction shortfall from the last bond auction will be financed by treasury cashflows, the Finance Ministry said after a plan to sell 2034 bonds was dropped amid spiking rates.

The Treasury said the decision was made not to sell the longer tenor as current high interest rates were considered temporary.

“In recnet weeks there has been a gradual upward pressure on interest yields observed at lamost all recent auctions for Government securities,” the Finance Ministry said.

“Although the fiscal position has improved substantially as a result of the decisive fiscal policy measures implemented by the government, the bidding pattern at recent auctions, including the auction held on 12.09.2024, appears to be driven by other factors which may include the market pricing on risk associated with uncertainties related to the forthcoming elections.

“Given the fact that the increase in yields was likely to have been driven by temporary factors, such as the short term uncertainty, accepting the entire amount offered would have resulted in the General Treasury facing an elevated interest cost over a longer period of time.”
