Police to trace traffic offenders through CCTV system from today

UPDATE:  The programme for the detection of traffic violations through the CCTV system established within the Colombo city was launched a short while ago by Public Security Minister Tiran Alles.

A special programme through which traffic offenders in Colombo will be traced using a CCTV surveillance camera system is set to be implemented from today (22 Jan.), Sri Lanka Police stated.

A pilot project of the initiative is set to commence in the country’s commercial capital from today, until 31 January, in a bid to curb traffic violations.

Accordingly, Police Media Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa explained that the CCTV camera system will be monitored by police personnel stationed in Colombo, after which, the registered owner of the relevant vehicle will be notified in the event a traffic offence is recorded.

SSP Thalduwa further noted that while the owner of the vehicle will be informed of any such offences during the pilot project, the issuance of fines will commence after 31 January.
