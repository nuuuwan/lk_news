Three more arrested over assault incident at Karapitiya Hospital

Three minor staff members of the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital including a female have been arrested in connection with a complaint by a senior oncologist alleging assault.

The concerned senior oncologist, Dr. Krishantha Perera, 61, was also arrested on 18 January for purportedly assaulting a female junior staff member during a contentious situation that had ensued the previous morning.

He was accused of assaulting the said staff member during a heated argument between him and the other junior staffers after he slammed them for disrupting hospital services by going on a token strike the day before.

The hospitalâ€™s authorities had brought the situation under control, however, a female junior staff member got herself admitted to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, claiming an assault by the senior oncologist who was subsequently arrested and remanded until January 22 on the orders of the Galle Magistrate.
