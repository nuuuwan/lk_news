Heavy showers expected in parts of the island

The Department of Meteorology says showery and windy conditions are expected to enhance due to pre-monsoonal conditions over the country and surrounding sea areas.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in Western, Sabaragamuwa, Eastern, Northern and North-western provinces and in Galle and Matara districts.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places elsewhere of the island after 12.00 noon, it said.

Heavy showers about 100mm are likely at some places in Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central, Eastern and Uva provinces.

General public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
