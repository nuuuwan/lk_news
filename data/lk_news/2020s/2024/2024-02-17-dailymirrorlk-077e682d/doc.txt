Colombo, Feb 17 (Daily Mirror) - Scores of Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) members from both the provincial and local government levels are to join UNP shortly, UNP General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara said yesterday.

Mr. Range Bandara told the Daily Mirror that more than 60 SJB members from local bodies and the North Central Provincial Council are expected to join UNP at the party’s Polonnaruwa District convention today.

“We expect some SJB MPS to join us as well, but it will take some time for those crossovers to take place,” he added.

There are low-ranking Sjbers to join us from all over the island,” he also said.
