Health workers protest...

At least 72 trade unions within the health sector engaged in their planned island-wide strike today, demanding a solution to a long-standing dispute over the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance. The trade union action commenced at 6:30 a.m. today. However, tri-forces personnel have been mobilized to support hospital operations amid the island-wide strike. Pix by Pradeep Dilrukshana
