Four former Presidents should bow out of politics: Dullas

Colombo, April 10 (Daily Mirror) - The four former Presidents who are in active politics should bow out for their own benefit and for the sake of the people, MP Dullas Alahapperuma said today.

MP Alahapperuma said former Presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, Maithripala Sirisena and Gotabaya Rajapaksa should keep away from active politics.

"Keeping away from politics is good for their own health and for the sake of the people. Public funds which are spent on them should not be used for any political matter," the MP said.

"Only one time US President John Quincy Adams contested for the US Congress. He is the only foreign head of state to remain in politics after his retirement from the post, he added.
