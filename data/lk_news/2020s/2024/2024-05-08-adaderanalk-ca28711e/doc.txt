State Minister Diana Gamage loses MP seat

The Supreme Court on Wednesday (May 08) declared that State Minister Diana Gamage is not legally qualified to hold a parliamentary seat.

Accordingly, delivering its verdict today, the three-judge Supreme Court bench decided that State Minister Diana Gamage is not eligible to hold the position of Member of Parliament.

The court had concluded the hearing of an appeal filed challenging the Appeals Court’s dismissal of a petition against State Minister Diana Gamage’s parliamentary membership. Upon concluding the proceedings on February 13, the judge bench decided to defer its verdict indefinitely.

Social activist Oshala Herath had put forward the appeals two weeks after the petition he had filed against the State Minister’s parliamentary seat and citizenship was dismissed by the Appeals Court.

Naming Gamage and several others as the respondents of his appeal, Herath said he had previously filed a petition alleging that the lawmaker is unqualified to hold the position of a member of parliament in Sri Lanka, as she also holds dual citizenship.
