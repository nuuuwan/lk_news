SL exporters explore cutting-edge food technology at Anuga FoodTec Exhibition in Germany

A delegation of nine representatives from Sri Lanka, representing key stakeholders from the Ministry of Agriculture, Elpitiya Plantation, Eastern and Allied Agencies and Hettigoda Industries embarked on a visit to the Anuga FoodTec trade fair in Köln, Germany. Organized by the Delegation of German Industry and Commerce in Sri Lanka (AHK Sri Lanka), this initiative aimed to immerse the delegates in the latest advancements in food production, processing, packaging, and storage.

Anuga FoodTec, which commenced on 19 March 2024, stands as a global leader in showcasing innovations across the entire spectrum of food technology, making it the ultimate destination for industry professionals seeking to stay at the forefront of developments in the field.

During their visit, the Sri Lankan delegates were introduced to cutting-edge technologies in various facets of food processing, including harvesting, supply chain management, packaging, and labeling. Notably, one standout aspect of the visit was the introduction of “freeze drying” machines, a technology that allows food nearing expiration to undergo a process extending its shelf life to 2 years, thus combating food wastage. Additionally, these machines are noted for their energy efficiency during production.

Delegation of German Industry and Commerce in Sri Lanka Head of Corporate Affairs and Export Promotions Malintha Gajanayake, underscored the profound importance of the delegation’s engagement.

“Being the official representative of bilateral economic relations between Sri Lanka and Germany, our initiative to bring the first Sri Lankan delegation to Anuga FoodTec is significant,” remarked Gajanayake. “We firmly believe that this endeavour will not only empower the delegation but also elevate Sri Lanka to unprecedented levels of competitiveness in the global market.”

The participation of the Sri Lankan delegation at Anuga FoodTec underscores the nation’s commitment to embracing innovation and adopting best practices in food production and technology. By leveraging the knowledge and insights gained from this international platform, Sri Lankan businesses aim to enhance their competitiveness and contribute to the growth and sustainability of the food and agriculture sector.
