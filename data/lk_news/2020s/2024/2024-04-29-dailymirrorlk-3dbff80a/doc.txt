Attempt to send 17 year-old-boy to London on forged documents foiled

Colombo, April 29 (Daily Mirror) - An attempt to send a 17-year-old boy abroad on forged travel documents was foiled and two women suspected of their involvement in the racket were arrested by the Border Surveillance Unit of the Department of Immigration and Emigration at the Bandaranaike International Airport.

One of the suspect woman from Mullativu had planned to fly to London with the boy and when they called over at the departure lounge, the officials, on suspicion of some irregularity in their travel documents referred them to the Border Surveillance Unit for further scrutiny.

After a technological checkup, the BSU found the travel documents had been forged.

Under interrogation in camera, the boy revealed that the woman who accompanied him was not his mother and that his mother was still waiting at the departure terminal.

The officials who arrested the two women questioned them to find that they had attempted to send the boy abroad due to economic constraints experienced at present and for the betterment of the child.

The CID conducted further Investigations to find that a racketeer living in England, responsible for human smuggling had forged the travel documents of the boy and the woman based on the details of his wife and son.
