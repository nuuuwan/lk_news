Parties should publicize their election manifestos well in advance: PAFFREL

Colombo, April 29 (Daily Mirror) - The political parties should publicize their election manifestos well in advance of any election, be it a Presidential or Parliamentary poll, to create a better and responsible political culture in the country, the Peoples' Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) said.

What is actually happening in Sri Lanka right now is that the political parties present their policy statements merely a month or so in advance of an election. Thus, the public will get no chance to build a fruitful discussion on them, the polls observer said.

Executive Director PAFFREL Rohana Hettiarachchi made these remarks while addressing a programme held in Colombo to raise awareness on creating a responsible political culture by encouraging political parties to present responsible and timely policy statements.

PAFFREL summoned representatives from political parties, civil society organisations, state sector officials as well as representatives from the media for a public discussion. A range of obstacles were identified and discussions were held on how and why political parties in Sri Lanka have failed to present a credible and realistic election manifesto throughout history.

The manifestos should be presented at least six months prior to any election, but what is happening right now is publicizing them even after the nominations have been handed out, Hettiarachchi said.

Parliamentarians Dallas Alahapperuma, Prof. Charitha Herath, Prof. Tissa Vitharana and several others were present.
