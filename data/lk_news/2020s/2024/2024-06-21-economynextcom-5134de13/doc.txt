Sri Lanka repays US$225mn to Reserve Bank of India in first quarter

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank has repaid 225 million US dollars to the Reserve Bank of India in the first quarter of 2024, on top of earlier repayments, official data shows.

In October 2023 the Sri Lanka gave a Treasury guarantee to cover a 2,601.43 million dollar credit from RBI to Sri Lanka’s central bank.

Sri Lanka’s got deferred payments due to India via the Asian Clearing Union during the worst currency crisis triggered by rate cuts since the creation of the central bank.

According to official data the outstanding debt due to the Reserve Bank of India fell to 2,226.43 million US dollars by end March 2024 from 2,451.43 million dollars in December.

From October the central bank had repaid 375 million dollars to India.

Sri Lanka has repaid debt and also collected reserves by avoiding precipitate rate cuts.

Repaying foreign debt or collecting foreign reserves requires interest rate to be kept a little higher to crowd out domestic credit and investments.

However, if rates are cut, claiming historical inflation was low, and the below market rates are enforced with open market operations, forex shortages will develop and reserves will be run down.

Analysts have said that RBI loans and swaps, which are were used to intervene in forex markets, also led to their sterilization with new money effectively re-financing private sector credit and delaying a correction the balance of payments.

Fortunately China’s swap, was made unusable as soon as reserves fell below 3 months of imports. Central bank swaps were invented by the Federal Reserve as it printed money for ‘macro-economic policy’ in the 1960s and delay market pricing rates triggering gold (reserve) losses. (Colombo/June21/2024)
