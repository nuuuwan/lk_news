Love being unique than perfect

Well, I’m 22 and the youngest in my family of four – that’s mom, dad and my elder brother. I’m currently an undergraduate at the University of Kelaniya, studying Microbiology, and I also work with BK Model Management as a model. I would like to consider myself as a seeker … I’m a curious person about life, nature and our existence. I am a believer in humanity and I always focus on refraining myself from judging people, and accept the diversity among each of us.

I really had a passion for the fashion industry, and modelling, from a very young age and, in 2022, I won the title of Miss Sri Lanka for Miss Earth and that gave me the encouragement to start modelling … professionally.

I think I am blessed to have a kind of a mixed race look and this helps me as a model as I can adapt my looks to suit the occasion and I am certain I have never failed to satisfy the crew I’m working with.

I love trying out different clothing styles … apart from lingerie.

05. What do you think is the most important aspect of modelling?

I would say respect and appreciation. The beauty scene has widened and the industry has expanded. Maintaining a mutual understanding and avoiding making others to feel uncomfortable is important.

06. If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?

So far, nothing, I would say. None of us are perfect and I believe that makes ourselves unique. I would love being unique than being perfect.

I am from Anuradhapura and I completed my primary education at Swarnapali Girls’ College and then, up to the Advanced level, I studied at Central College Anuradhapura. I was privileged to be the school captain, and I represented my school as a student parliament. I was a member of the school soccer team. I did music and stage drama, as well. I was able to bring fame to my school from oratory, singing and drama competitions. I must say I did almost everything one could do during their school time.

I can’t pick one particular moment because I always try to find myself something that makes me happy in every situation. But the day I got selected to do Microbiology was a really special one.

When we stop trying to find happiness from others we will have perfect happiness.

A guy with a pleasant smile is an ideal type. And, of course, a person who can smoothly adapt to the different phases in life and someone who would never get bored of me and appreciate me all the time. I love a simple, kind and a caring person.

My mom, of course. She’s the strongest person I’ve seen in the whole world. I believe the strength and vision I have with me is from her. She never restricted me from experiencing the world; she always had faith in me, and what I am today it’s all because of her. She always guided me to bring out the best in me.

It’s my heart. I would try my best to keep it healthy and happy. I do have a big heart to help the world and I must treasure it in order to do better things.

13. If you were marooned on a desert island, who would you like as your companion?

It would be my partner because I won’t feel bored and I will feel secured.

Well, I’m not so good at initiating a conversation, and I often feel embarrassed of asking wired stuff from strangers.

Many … but I’ll mention the time I represented my country at the Miss Earth International competition. Winning the title was unexpected because I participated in the pageant to get some experience and to polish up myself to initiate my passion for modelling. I’m from a really normal family and the time period I had to prepare for the pageant was less than one month. I had to find the expenses, design my clothing and train myself within that short period. I had no sponsors and I didn’t have any connections in the field to seek help at that point in time. I couldn’t afford to have a personal trainer, or hire expensive attires, and I had to do it all alone, with the help of my family. I was young, alone and I had zero experience but somehow with the encouragement I got from my family, and my closest friends, I was able to participate in the international competition, in the Philippines, and, honestly, I received lots of love over there and it gave me all the confidence I needed. Sometimes I still can’t imagine that I did it.

Somewhere, with good food, closer to nature, and away from many people. I don’t prefer going on a vacation alone so, of course, if I have my loved ones with me it would be ideal.

I don’t have anything specific. Let’s say it depends on my mood.

Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation because I used to work there as a news anchor. I got the opportunity of learning things in this field and my confidence, in front of the camera, was boosted … thanks to the time I worked there.

I am planning to pursue my career in Microbiology, after graduating. I will continue doing my best to stabilise myself in the modelling industry, as well. I will work for my advocacy, I initiated, during my time as Miss Sri Lanka Earth, with the help of the exposure I get, through my modelling career.
