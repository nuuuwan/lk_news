Sri Lanka EDB signs World Fair Trade Network cooperation framework

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Export Development Board has signed a Framework of Cooperation (FOC) with international fair trade network to strengthen ties between the Network and export related institutions in Sri Lanka.

The framework aims to promote the development, diversification and wider market access of fair trade products from Sri Lanka to the global market, the EDB said in a statement.

“The collaborative framework outlines multiple objectives and related activities that will be further developed into comprehensive action plans in collaboration with supporting institutions in the near future.”

Cooperating organisations partnered in the Global Market Network include the Fair Trade Advocacy Office (FTAO), Fair Trade Network of Asia and Pacific Producers (Fairtrade NAPP), Fair Trade NAPP-Sri Lanka (FNSL), and World Fair Trade Organization-Asia (WFTO-Asia).

The fair trade standards are said to empower farming and labour communities by addressing power imbalances in trade relationships, volatile markets and inequities in traditional trade. The approach is meant to contribute to increasing foreign exchange earnings for the countries and socio-economic development of farmers and workers across countries. (Colombo/Jan17/2024)
