Indians running IT firm with visit visa apprehended

Colombo, May 28 (Daily Mirror) - A group of Indian nationals who were illegally running an IT based firm in Colombo 7 on mere visit visas to remain in Sri Lanka was taken into custody by the Department of Immigration and Emigration.

The officials of the departmentâ€™s Investigation Division following an inquiry raided a house in Cinnamon Gardens and took seven males and one female who were in their thirties.

A senior detective from the division told the Daily Mirror that all the foreigners have arrived in the country on visit visas and two of them were found to have overstayed their 14 days visa period.

The arrested female was reportedly the wife of one of the other seven suspects.

Preliminary inquiries revealed that the group had rented a house in Cinnamon Gardens to carry out their IT company and the authorities are conducting further investigations to determine what kind of work they have actually performed in Sri Lanka.

The immigration authorities are making preparations to remove the arrested group in due course once their removal paperwork is done with return air ticketing.

According to the local immigration law it is illegal to engage in any form of employment under a visit visa, the officials said.
