Govt. extends free rice program to assist vulnerable communities: Semasinghe

State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe yesterday said the Government is poised to continue its free rice program for the months of April and May this year.

He said the initiative aims to provide essential assistance to those who have not previously benefited from any subsidy program.

“Under this extended program, individuals currently receiving pensions, as well as those who had previously received prosperity benefits but lost their pensions, will be included. Additionally, beneficiaries of kidney, elderly, and disabled allowances will also be covered,” he said after attending the launch of various development projects in areas including Mihintale, Vilachchiya and Nachchiduwa.

Semasinghe stressed that even individuals who have missed out on previous subsidy programs can be included in this initiative, with divisional secretaries granted the authority to facilitate their inclusion.

“Each selected family will receive 20 kilos of rice this time, building on the success of the previous distribution where 2.75 million families benefited from the subsidy,” he noted.

The State Minister said the Government aims to alleviate the financial burden on those most in need, particularly amidst fixed prices for essential services such as oil and electricity.

The continuation of the free rice program underscores the Government’s commitment to supporting vulnerable communities and ensuring their access to basic necessities during challenging times.
