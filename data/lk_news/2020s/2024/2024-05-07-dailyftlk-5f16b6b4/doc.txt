Alles denies allegations of VFS Global’s election contribution

Public Security Minister Tiran Alles yesterday vehemently refuted claims suggesting that VFS Global had made a $ 10 million campaign contribution for upcoming elections.

Addressing reporters yesterday, Minister Alles dismissed the allegations as baseless and untrue.

“I saw something that VFS had given $ 10 million for President Wickremesinghe’s election campaign,” Minister Alles stated.

His remarks come in response to recent allegations made by Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, who, through a post on ‘X’ on 4 May suggested that the only logical explanation is absolute corruption for the visa deal.

“I also saw today that Sajith Premadasa had demanded money to stop talking about it. These are both wrong. Doing these things will not help the country. I am asking to tell the truth to educate the public. I do not take even 5 cents from anyone. The people in the country know that,” Alles affirmed.

The Minister also said he cannot be influenced by even the most influential individual in the country to accept money or be compelled into doing so.
