Gammanpila to launch campaign to collect signatures for public petition against misuse of law

Sarvajana Balaya Colombo district candidate and former MP Udaya Gammanpila yesterday announced his plans to launch a campaign to collect signatures for a public petition, to inform the President of the people’s displeasure over the misuse of the law.

Addressing the media, he criticised the Government for retaining Public Security Ministry Secretary former Senior DIG Ravi Seneviratne and Criminal Intelligence Analysis and Prevention Division in the Sri Lanka Police Director Shani Abeysekara.

Gammanpila claims the two officers were named as main accused in an investigative committee report on the Easter Sunday attacks.

“Since the removal will not be done, we are hoping to sign a public petition to inform the President Anura Kumara Dissanayake about people’s displeasure related to the misuse of the law by this Government; during their first month in office,” he said, noting that this is the same politician (President) who earlier criticised former Presidents for misusing the law.

Gammanpila further expressed his plan to reach out to the community in various places to gather public discontent towards the National People’s Power (NPP) party to include in the said public petition.
