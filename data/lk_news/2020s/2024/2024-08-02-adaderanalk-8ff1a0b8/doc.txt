SC to consider petitions against Adani wind power project in Mannar

The Supreme Court has fixed for consideration on October 14 the five Fundamental Rights petitions filed seeking an order to invalidate the Cabinet approval granted for Indiaâ€™s Adani Green Energy for a wind power project in Wedithalathivu, Mannar.

The petitions were taken up today (02) before the Supreme Court judge bench consisting of Justices, S. Thurairaja, A.H.M.D. Nawaz, Shiran Gunaratne and Achala Wengappuli.

The respondents named in the petitions were ordered by the court to file limited objections, if any, before August 20 while any counter objections related to those were ordered to be filed before September 13.

The petitions, submitted by five parties including the Centre for Environmental Justice, argue that the proposed wind farm poses significant threats to ecological biodiversity and the safety of migratory birds.
