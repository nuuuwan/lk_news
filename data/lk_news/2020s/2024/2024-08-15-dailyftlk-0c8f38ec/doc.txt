Litro Gas Lanka, Sri Lanka’s leading LPG provider, has announced significant developments in its supply and distribution network. The company has undertaken a series of strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing the accessibility and reliability of LPG services across the country.

As per the Sales and Marketing Plans for 2024, areas are identified for supplier and distribution expansion.

The existing distributor yards in Aluthgama, Panadura, Palamunai-Batticaloa, and Navalady-Batticaloa have been refurbished, featuring new office infrastructure and an expanded vehicle fleet. These upgrades are set to improve the quality of service and delivery efficiency.

In addition to these refurbishments, new distribution yards have been established in Wellawaya, Godakawela, Padeniya, Waradala-Kotadeniyawa, Walathapitiya-Ampara, and Mulamaldeniya. This expansion enhances service coverage, particularly in rural areas, providing better access to LPG for all Sri Lankans.

To support these operations, new staff members have been recruited from local communities, bolstering the workforce and promoting regional employment. The expansion also includes additional vehicles and infrastructure improvements, crucial for streamlining operations and ensuring efficient service delivery.

These efforts will integrate seamlessly with Litro Gas’s primary filling operations at Kerawalapitiya and the newly-commissioned Mabima storage and filling facility. This integration is vital for maintaining a seamless supply chain and addressing the increasing demand for LPG across the country.

Litro Gas’s expanded and refurbished network will support the seamless supply of LPG to 4.5 million domestic households, 12,500 dealer points/sales points, over 16,000 HoReCa establishments (Hotels, Restaurants, Catering), and more than 6,000 medium and large commercial businesses.

Distributors have shown increased confidence in the company’s leadership and organisational sustainability, recognising LPG as an essential service rather than just a commodity. This belief in the growth and future of LPG usage underscores the importance of Litro Gas’s role in ensuring energy security.

Litro Gas Lanka Chairman and CEO Muditha Peiris highlighted the company’s commitment to ensure access to clean and safe energy for all Sri Lankans, stating: “Access to clean and safe energy is not a privilege, but a fundamental right of every citizen. Our expansion efforts are a testament to our commitment to providing uninterrupted LPG supply to all parts of the country.”

These enhancements to the distribution network follow the successful commissioning of the state-of-the-art Mabima facility, demonstrating Litro Gas’s commitment to operational excellence and ensuring that all citizens have access to this essential resource.
