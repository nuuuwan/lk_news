Controversial monk ‘Vishwa Buddha’ expelled from monkhood

Ven. Ratnapure Wimalabuddha, the controversial saffron-robbed monk claiming to be ‘Vishwa Buddha’, who was re-arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) over allegedly issuing statements demeaning Buddhism, has been expelled from the monkhood.

This decision has been communicated to the Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs by the Chief Prelate (Mahanayaka Thero) of Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya, Most Venerable Makulewe Wimalabhidhana Thero.

The Sangha Sabha Committee of Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya has unanimously arrived at this decision on December 15, 2023.

Accordingly, both the ‘Samanera’ and ‘Upasampada’ ordination documents of Ratnapure Wimalabuddha Thero will be invalidated along with the relevant decision.

Furthermore, issuing a statement, Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya has announced that the decision to expel the monk in question was taken in consideration of the immense damage and demeaning done to the Buddha Sasana by him.

The saffron-robbed monk claiming to be ‘Vishwa Buddha’ has been ordered to be remanded in custody until January 26, after being produced before the Gangodawila Magistrate’s Court in Nugegoda.

The suspect, who was out on bail, was re-arrested this morning (21) by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID).

Earlier, the monk was arrested on December 12 at a private establishment in Kalagedihena by the cybercrimes unit of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), acting on a complaint received against the self-styled monk who was residing in Ratnapura.

According to police, the saffron-robbed monk had allegedly issued statements demeaning Buddhism.
