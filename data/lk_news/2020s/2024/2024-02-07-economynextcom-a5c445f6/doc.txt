Sri Lanka textile and apparel roadshow to be held in London

ECONOMYNEXT – Sourced Sri Lanka – Textile and Apparel Roadshow, an export promotion program in London, is expected to be attended by 50 Sri Lankan exhibitors and attract thousands of foreign buyers and trade visitors.

The exhibition is scheduled to be held in June and has been organised by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB), Sri Lanka Apparel Sourcing Association (SLASA), Sri Lanka High Commission in UK, and the Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF).

The objective of the exhibition is to “support apparel exporters in establishing business connections with UK buyers and expanding exports to the UK through the UK Developing Countries Trading Scheme (DCTS) and expand the Sri Lanka apparel exports share to the UK,” SLASA said in a statement.

“Additionally, the aim is to showcase Sri Lanka as a responsible apparel manufacturing destination in Asia, fostering awareness among UK-based buyers.”

Sri Lanka’s garment export sector is facing a decrease in demand in the high-end market over the last two years in its main markets, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and European countries.

“To cope with this situation, it will be essential to identify new markets as well as new buyers within the market.” (Colombo/Feb6/2024)
