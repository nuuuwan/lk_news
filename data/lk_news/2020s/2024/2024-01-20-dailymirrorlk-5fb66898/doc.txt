Sri Lanka remains open for positive role dousing India- Maldives tension

Colombo, Jan 20 (Daily Mirror) -  Sri Lanka remains open to play a positive role in dousing tension between India and the Maldives in the greater interest of regional peace, Daily Mirror learns.

First, tension between India and the Maldives flared up since the election of the new Maldivian president Mohamed Muizzu who openly advocates a pro-China policy and even called for Indian troops to leave his country for a foreign policy with better ties with China.

Later, on January 4, social media posts from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi praising the beauty of India’s beaches in Lakshadweep sparked a diplomatic row with the Maldives, a country that counts on tourism as its main source of income.

After social media posts, three Maldivian junior ministers criticized the Indian prime minister, which led to calls from Indian social media users to boycott Maldives as a tourist destination.

Sri Lankan Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabry who met with his Maldivian counterpart Moosa Zameer on the sidelines of the NAM Summit in Uganda is reported to have to have stressed the need for regional peace and stability for the benefit of all countries.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe is expected to hold bilateral discussions with Indian External Affairs Minister Dr.S. Jaishankar in Uganda today. In addition to bilateral matters, the tension between India- Maldives is likely to be discussed.
