SriLankan to codeshare with Air Seychelles to Africa

ECONOMYNEXT – State-run SriLankan and and Air Seychelles, the national airline of the Republic of Seychelles, have embarked on a codeshare partnership which could lead to multiple new destinations throughout Asia, Africa and Australia for their passengers flying between Colombo and Mahé, SriLankan said in a statement.

For Air Seychelles, over 20 destinations are included in the partnership, which includes much requested destinations such as Sydney and Melbourne in Australia as well as other popular stops in India, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.

“This new codeshare agreement will allow SriLankan Airlines and Air Seychelles to place their codes on each other’s flights and enable passengers to continue their journey conveniently using a single booking and with their luggage checked in all the way to the final destination,” SriLankan Airlines said in s statement.

“We are pleased to boost our codeshare network and presence in the African region through this new partnership. We look forward to working with Air Seychelles to provide our customers more African destination options in the coming years,” Richard Nuttall, Chief Executive Officer of SriLankan Airlines said,

Flights under the codeshare agreement are available to book now and will begin operating in May 2024.

“Now that we have been flying to Colombo for over 9 months, the twice-weekly flights have proven successful,” Charles Johnson, Air Seychelles’ Chief Commercial Officer said.

“The next step to solidifying our relationship is with this code-share, allowing even more passengers the convenience of a single ticket to more points served by our partner in Asia and Australia.” (Colombo/April 26/2024)
