US warns citizens off Sri Lanka’s Arugam Bay citing possible attack

ECONOMYNEXT  – The United States embassy has asked nationals to avoid Arugam Bay in Sri Lanka’s Eastern Coast, a popular tourist destination, saying there is credible information of an attack.

“The Embassy received credible information warning of an attack targeting popular tourist locations in the Arugam Bay area,” the US embassy said in notice on its website.

“Due to the serious risk posed by this threat, the Embassy imposed a travel restriction on Embassy personnel for Arugam Bay effective immediately and until further notice.
