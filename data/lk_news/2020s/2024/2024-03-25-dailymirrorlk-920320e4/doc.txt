Protest at Kelaniya University over sudden death of student last night

Colombo, March 25 (Daily Mirror) - A group of students attached to the Kelaniya University is currently protesting in front of the university administrative building over the death of a student due to a sudden illness, a student union said.

They said a total of 150 students gathered in front of the university administrative building this morning.

They claimed that a fourth-year student at the university passed away last night (24) after being hospitalized due to a sudden illness.

The university students allege that the delayed hospitalization of the student in question was a result of the absence of ambulance facilities or other vehicles on the university premises to transport the affected student to the hospital.
