Organised group disconnecting power supplies to disrepute government: Kanchana

Parliament, May 07 (Daily Mirror)- An organised group is operating to disconnect the power supplies of electricity consumers who had defaulted in paying their bills to disrepute and embarrass the government, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara said today.

He told Parliament that the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has launched an investigation into the matter.

The Minister said this while responding to a question raised by SJB MP Thushara Indunil about the power disconnections.

Minister Wijesekara said there was a proper procedure for power disconnections and added that disciplinary action will be taken against officials who fail to adopt the due procedures.

"There is a proper procedure to issue red notices and a certain time gap for disconnections after issuing red notices. And also, there is a procedure to follow at the time of disconnecting the supply. The proper procedure must be followed when disconnections are carried out. It is reported that an organised group is operating to disrepute and inconvenience the government. Power supply of SLPP MP Jagath Kumara had been disconnected in similar manner without prior notice," he said.

MP Jagath Kumara said his power supply was disconnected without prior notice for defaulting just one month's bill and that it was unreasonable.

"People are inconvenienced because of this unreasonable acts by the CEB," he said.
