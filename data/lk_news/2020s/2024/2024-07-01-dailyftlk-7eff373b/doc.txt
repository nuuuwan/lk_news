Tiran offers SL police expertise to combat global security threats

Sri Lanka has pledged its commitment to bolstering global security efforts by offering the expertise of Sri Lankan police officers to combat rising security threats, announced Public Security Minister Tiran Alles at the United Nations Chiefs of Police Summit (UNCOPS 2024) held at the UN Headquarters in New York yesterday.

Representing Sri Lanka at the conference themed “Prevention of Conflict and Violence and Maintenance of Peace,” Minister Tiran Alles underscored the increasingly complex nature of global security challenges. These challenges, he noted, include the escalation of violent conflicts, the humanitarian crisis in conflict zones affecting civilians, and the emergence of unconventional threats such as cybercrime and weaponised technology.

Minister Alles also highlighted the detrimental impact of organised crime and gang violence on international peace and stability.

Asserting Sri Lanka’s dedication to international security initiatives, Minister Alles expressed confidence in the capabilities of Sri Lanka’s police units. He urged the United Nations to consider deploying specialised police units to tackle organised crime and gang violence effectively.

Furthermore, Minister Alles announced Sri Lanka’s readiness to deploy experienced police officers and experts to support local criminal justice professionals in combating these threats. He emphasised Sri Lanka’s willingness to share its knowledge and experience with partner countries facing similar security challenges.
