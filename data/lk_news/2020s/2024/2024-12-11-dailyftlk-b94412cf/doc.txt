Food Policy and Safety Committee to boost national food security

In a bid to ensure national food and nutrition security, the Government has approved the establishment of a Food Policy and Safety Committee under the Presidential Office.

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the proposal submitted by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake aimed at providing every citizen with access to quality food in sufficient quantities at affordable prices, fulfilling nutritional requirements, and promoting food safety across the country.

The move aligns with the Government’s policy, which emphasises self-sufficiency by boosting domestic food production and maintaining a three-month buffer stock of essential food items.

“The policy prioritises the creation of a robust data system to monitor food stocks, production, storage and distribution — which is lacking at the moment,” Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

The Committee Co-Chaired by the Agriculture, Livestock Land and Irrigation Minister and Trade, Commerce, Food Security and Cooperative Development Minister will include the participation of Secretaries from relevant Ministries including the Secretary to the Prime Minister.

He said the Committee is tasked to provide policy guidance through data-driven scientific analysis and foster collaboration among public and private stakeholders to boost efficiency in food production, wholesale and retail operations.

“We must admit that the country has an issue in food production and no database to monitor the situation,” he added.
