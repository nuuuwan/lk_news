G.L and others to sign political pact with SJB today

The main opposition party, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) yesterday announced that dissident Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MPs including Prof. G.L Peiris and several others will sign a coalition agreement with the party today.

Addressing a press conference yesterday SJB Deputy National Organiser S.M Marikkar said this was yet another step in the party’s effort to form the broadest political alliance in Sri Lanka’s political history.

Marikkar noted that the coalition’s focus extends beyond the upcoming elections, encompassing agreements on various policies and reforms essential for the formation of a future government. “More groups will join with us going forward,” he said.

However, the SJB MP declined to disclose the identities of the groups intending to join the party.
