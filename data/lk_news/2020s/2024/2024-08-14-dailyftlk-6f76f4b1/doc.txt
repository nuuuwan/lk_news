Cabinet clears submission of Import and Export Regulation for Parliamentary approval

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved a proposal presented by the President, in his capacity as the Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policy Minister, to submit the Import and Export (Control) Regulation No. 10 of 2024 for Parliamentary approval.

This regulation, formulated under the provisions of the Import and Export (Control) Act No. 01 of 1969, was officially published in the Extraordinary Gazette No. 2393/36 dated 18 July 2024.

The new regulation is expected to have significant implications for Sri Lanka’s import and export activities, as it aims to modernise and streamline the regulatory framework governing these sectors.

Once approved, the regulation will provide updated guidelines and controls for importers and exporters, ensuring that Sri Lanka’s trade policies are effectively managed in a rapidly changing global market.
