Ex-Health Minister Keheliya and six others further remanded

Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, former Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Chandragupta and 5 others have been further remanded until 14th March by the Maligakanda Magistrate Court over the import of substandard human immunoglobulin vials.

Former Minister Rambukwella, who was in remand custody, was produced before the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court earlier today (29), along with the other accused when the case was taken up.

On 15 February, Rambukwella and six others including former Health Secretary Janaka Chandragupta were remanded until 29 February on orders of the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court.

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Rambukwella on 02 February in connection with the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), when he arrived there, complying with a court order. He had been grilled for nearly 10 hours before being arrested.

The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker.

Prior to the apprehension of Rambukwella, seven arrests had been made in connection with the drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail. As such, the former Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministry’s Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, now remain in remand custody.

Meanwhile a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition was filed Thursday (29 Feb.) on behalf of former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella.

Rambukwella’s attorneys have filed the relevant petition challenging his arrest by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), and demanding a compensation of Rs. 100 million.
