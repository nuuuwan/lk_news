President’s comments on debt negotiations seen as injecting buoyancy to bourse

The stock market yesterday bounced back following President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s statement at a political rally in Matara that Sri Lanka will be freed from bankruptcy status if bondholders conclude their negotiations on debt restructuring this week.

Most of local and foreign investors expect bondholders to conclude their negotiations on the external debt before the election and this prompted them to be active in the market.

Amid those developments, both indices moved upwards. The All Share Price Index went up by 61.21 points while S and P SL20 rose by 24.7 points.

Turnover stood at Rs 1.2 billion with three crossings. Those crossings were reported in NTB, which crossed 400,000 shares to the tune of Rs 45.4 million; its shares traded at Rs 114.50, HNB 200,000 shares crossed for Rs 33 million; its shares traded at Rs 165 and Lanka Aluminium 928,000 shares crossed for Rs 20.9 million; its shares sold at Rs 22.50.

In the retail market, six companies that mainly contributed to the turnover were; HNB Rs 235 million (1.4 million shares traded), Commercial Bank Rs 93 million (1.1 million shares traded), Sampath Bank Rs 70.6 million (973,000 shares traded), Pan Asia Bank Rs 39.8 million (2.1 million shares traded), Dipped Products Rs 39.1 million (1.1 million shares traded) and Lanka IOC Rs 32.4 million (313,000 shares traded). During the day 57.5 million share volumes changed hands in 11800 transactions.

Yesterday banking sector counters were very active and they were the biggest contributor to the turnover. The manufacturing sector, especially Dipped Products and Lanka Aluminium, became the second largest contributor.

Yesterday, the rupee was weaker at Rs 304.25/50 to the US dollar from 303.75/85 the previous day, dealers said. Bond yields were up, they said, while stocks opened up 0.32 percent higher.

A bond maturing on 15.12.2028 was quoted at 11.85/90 percent, up from 11.70/80 percent.

A bond maturing on 15.06.2029 was quoted at 13.70/75 percent, down from 13.80/90 percent.
