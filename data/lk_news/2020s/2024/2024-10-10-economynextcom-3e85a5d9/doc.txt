Sri Lanka president meets chief revenue collectors

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s President Anura Dissanayake has met with officials of two major revenue collectors, the Customs and Inland Revenue departments, to discuss enhancing tax collection.

Dissanayake met senior officials from both the Sri Lanka Customs Department and the Inland Revenue Department at the Presidential Secretariat on Wednesday (9) his media division said.

“The discussions centered on strategies to enhance revenue generation and improve operational efficiency within both departments, in line with the government’s broader economic mandate,” the PMD said.

The officials explained the challenges they face in managing revenue and tackling tax evasion, and “stressed the importance of strengthening coordination between the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) and Customs to effectively combat these issues.”

Better collaboration would ensure more robust enforcement of tax laws and prevent tax leakage, further boosting the country’s revenue collection, they said.
