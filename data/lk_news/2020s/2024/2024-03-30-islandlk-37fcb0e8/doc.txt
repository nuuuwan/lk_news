John Keells Properties launches Phase 2 of its latest real estate development, ‘Viman’ Ja-Ela

John Keells Properties proudly announces the launch of Phase 2 of ‘Viman’ Ja-Ela. 90% of Phase 1 of this highly sought after project has been successfully sold to date. Comprising two blocks, the new Phase will feature 2 & 3 bedroomed apartments. Phase 2 provides a limited time opportunity for prospective homeowners as Phase 1 was almost sold out in less than six months since its launch on 19th September 2023. Prospective buyers interested in owning an apartment at Viman can now visit the model apartment in Colombo and have all their queries answered by a professional team.

Nadeem Shums, Head of Sales & Marketing, John Keells Properties and Vice President, John Keells Group said, “We are overwhelmed by the response to ‘Viman’ Phase 1 and thrilled to launch Phase 2, now that 90% of Phase 1 has been successfully sold. Viman makes for a compelling investment not only because it is the latest real estate project by John Keells Properties, but also because of its convenient location in Ja-Ela and its offering of a serene environment in the heart of Ja-Ela. Phase 2 offers aesthetic views of the greenery in the courtyard, the garden of the property, while also offering a view of the cityscape.”

Sprawling across 6 acres in the heart of Ja-Ela, Viman offers a harmonious blend of modern comforts with 418 apartments and is designed to provide a secure, family-friendly environment with convenient access to Colombo city, while retaining the charm of a small-town setting.
