Tharushi Karunaratne’s 800m challenge ends at Paris Olympics

Sri Lankan athlete Tharushi Karunaratne’s journey in the Women’s 800m event at the Paris Olympics concluded after she finished 7th in Heat 4 of the Repechage round.

Karunaratne initially competed in the preliminary round of the event on the last night (Aug 02), where she finished 8th with a timing of 2:07.76. As Karunaratne was placed 8th in the race, she did not advance directly to the next round.

The repechage round is a second shot given for runners who fail to advance out of the first round in 2024 Olympics, which is in place for the first time in Olympic athletics history.
