Triple tragedy for mother of four

She laments enduring four months without electricity, and two weeks of water scarcity

In a distressing tale from Kebithigolleva, a 33-year-old mother of four found herself in dire circumstances as she laments enduring four months without electricity, two weeks of water scarcity, and the recent loss of her husband, the main breadwinner who supported the family through odd jobs.

The grieving mother found herself thrust into a challenging situation following the tragic death of her husband, PK Chaturanga (34). The father of her two school-going children - a 6th grade boy and 4th grade girl, they also have another 2-year-old boy and a 40-day-old baby - her husband lost his life after a sudden collision with a cow while riding a motorcycle. The incident occurred near their residence, leaving the family shattered.

PK Chaturanga, who supported the family through daily wage labour, had gone to Kebithigollewa town on May 12th to collect some dues from his temporary workplace. Tragically, he succumbed to his injuries after a 13-day battle at Anuradhapura Hospital.

Community support poured in as local residents came together to perform the last rites for the deceased. Despite facing challenges such as power and water cuts on the day of her husband’s funeral, the mother, with the help of kind neighbours, managed to navigate through the difficult times.

“ I discovered that the electricity bill amounts to approximately Rs. 44,000 and the water bill to about Rs. 23,000, these sums I am unable to settle,” she said.
