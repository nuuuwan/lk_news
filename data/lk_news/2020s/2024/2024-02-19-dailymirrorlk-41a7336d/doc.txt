Fr. Cyril Gamini on anti-Cardinal protests in Colombo

Colombo, Feb 19 (Daily Mirror) - The Archdiocese of Colombo today assured that the fisheries harbour in Pitipana, Negombo will be handed over to an authority.

It ensures that the fisherfolk in the area get maximum benefit from it.

“The Cardinal never had any intention of using the property for his personal purposes at any point,” Cardinal’s spokesman Fr. Cyril Gamini Fernando said in a statement.

Fr. Fernando made this remark in relation to a protest held by a group claiming to be fishermen, in front of Archbishop's House today. The protestors claimed that Cardinal Ranjith had taken over the fisheries harbour by force.

“The objective behind the Archbishop's decision to take legal action was to ensure transparency when it comes to the administration of the fisheries harbour. We do not want to see a handful of people benefiting from it,” Fr. Fernando added.

The Archbishop had already appointed an authority after consulting representatives of the Mankuliya, Thalahena and Basiyawatte parishes according to Fr, Fernando.

Court had ordered the appointment of an authority, and to handover all assets to this authority on February 2, 2023.  It was reported that the fisheries harbour was handed over to the United Fisheries Association as a gift with some conditions by late Cardinal Thomas Cooray in 1963. However, these conditions have been violated by a handful of people who had claimed to be the members of the fisheries association.

A protest was held by a group of people who claimed to be fishermen, in front of the Archbishop's House thus creating a tense situation.
