Sri Lanka NSBM university to get medical faculty

ECONOMYNEXT – A Faculty of Medicine is to be established at the National School of Business Management, in Homagama, Cabinet spokesman Bandula Gunawardena said.

“A large number of our students are going abroad to study medicine,” Minister Bandula Gunawardena said Tuesday announcing the week’s Cabinet decisions.

“It has been proposed to establish a medical faculty under the direct supervision and regulation of the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health and the Sri Lanka Medical Council at the National School of Business Management, a fully self-financed institution owned by the government and to award MBBS degrees through it.”

The new faculty will be able to enroll 500 local and foreign students annually for the degree course, Gunawardena said.

“The Homagama Base Hospital will be upgraded to teaching hospital status, like the Kalubowila Hospital, for the undergraduates’ clinical training (sa-ya-ni-ka pu-hu-nu-wa).”

Gunawardena said NSBM has agreed to provide necessary funds for the development of Homagama Base Hospital in accordance with the standards of medical education published by the Sri Lanka Medical Council. (Colombo/Mar12/2024)
