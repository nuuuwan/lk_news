Korea hands over $ 5 m floating solar photovoltaic power  plants in Southern Province

The Republic of Korea, represented by Ambassador Miyon Lee, officially handed over Sri Lanka’s first-ever floating solar photovoltaic (PV) power plants located at the Chandrika Wewa and Kiriibban Wewa reservoirs.

This ground-breaking renewable energy initiative marks a major milestone in Sri Lanka’s transition toward sustainable energy solutions.

Key attendees included Additional Secretary of Ministry of Power and Energy Tharshini Prashanth, and Sustainable Energy Authority (SEA) Chairman Prof. T.M.W.J. Bandara.

The $ 5 million project, funded by the Korean Government since 2022, was developed in collaboration with the Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology (KIAT) and implemented by Yooshin Engineering and Bosung Powertec.

Each floating solar photovoltaic power plant, capable of generating 1MW, uses reservoir surfaces, conserving land resources while reducing environmental impact.

During her address, Ambassador Lee underscored Korea’s enduring support for Sri Lanka’s renewable energy goals and highlighted the alignment with global objectives outlined at COP28.

She also expressed enthusiasm for finalising the Climate Change Cooperation Agreement between the two nations.

“As Sri Lanka’s fourth-largest bilateral Official Development Assistance (ODA) partner, Korea remains committed to supporting the country’s energy journey through innovative and sustainable solutions,” said Ambassador Lee. “This project will serve as a foundation for broader and deeper collaboration between our two nations in years to come.”

The Embassy said this transformative project exemplifies the growing partnership between Korea and Sri Lanka, emphasising a shared vision for advancing green energy, climate resilience, and a sustainable future.
