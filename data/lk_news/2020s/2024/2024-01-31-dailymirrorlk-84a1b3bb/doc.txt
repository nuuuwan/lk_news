Surge in vehicle ownership transfers to avert CCTV-based fine complications

Colombo, Jan 31 (Daily Mirror) - The Commissioner General of the Department of Motor Traffic (DMT) said today that a large number of people are currently visiting the Department to transfer vehicle ownerships to their names.

DMT Commissioner General Nishantha Anuruddha Weerasingha told the Daily Mirror that this was the first time that such a large number of people are queuing at the DMT to get their vehicle ownerships transferred to avoid complications when fine notices are issued based on offender identification through the CCTV system.

He said if the ownership is not transferred to the active user, the charge sheets will be sent to the address of the previous vehicle owner.

Therefore, the Commissioner urged vehicle users to transfer ownerships to the active user to avoid inconveniencing the previous vehicle owner.
