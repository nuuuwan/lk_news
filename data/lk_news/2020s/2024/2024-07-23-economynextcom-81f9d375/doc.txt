Sri Lanka to lease Beira Lake island to Gangarama Temple for tourist venture

ECONOMYNEXT – Bird Island, located on the Beira Lake in Sri Lanka’s financial district is to be leased to the Sri Jinarathana Vocational Technical Training Centre on a 50-year long term lease basis, Cabinet spokesman minister Bandula Gunawardena said.

“Bird Island will be developed as a tourist attraction,” Gunawardena told reporters on Tuesday.

A request was made by the Chief Incumbent of the Gangarama Temple to use the land to be developed as a tourist attraction place focusing cultural heritage, a cabinet statement said.

The 143 perch island located on the southwest Beira Lake was transferred to the Urban Development Authority as a part of Colombo City Development Plan under the Beira lake Restoration Project in 2000.

The Cabinet of Ministers has approved the proposal presented by the Minister of Urban Development and Housing to transfer the said portion of land to the Sri Jinrathana institute belonging to the Gangarama Temple on lease basis for a period of 50 years based on the value determined by the Chief Assessor of the Government.
