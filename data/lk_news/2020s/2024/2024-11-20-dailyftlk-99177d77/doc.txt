FTZMA welcomes NPP’s landslide victory at General Election, pledges support for economic reforms

The Free Trade Zone Manufacturers Association (FTZMA), sole trade chamber representing export-oriented companies under the purview of the Board of Investment (BOI) has congratulated the National People’s Power (NPP) on its resounding victory in the recent General Elections.

In a statement issued recently, the FTZMA commended the NPP’s success, describing it as a reflection of the strength of Sri Lanka’s democratic principles. The victory, they noted, underscores the people’s desire for a stable Government capable of driving reforms essential for a true national renaissance.

The association also emphasised its readiness to collaborate with the new administration to advance Sri Lanka’s economic development.

Key areas of focus outlined by the chamber include eradicating corruption, promoting good governance and improving the ease of doing business.

They also highlighted the importance of streamlining investment processes through a single-window concept, implementing automation and digitisation, advancing labour reforms and improving living standards through a sustainable development agenda.

The FTZMA expressed confidence that these measures would foster foreign investment, strengthen the export sector and contribute to the country’s long-term economic prosperity.

“We believe these efforts will lead to greater success and prosperity for the export industry in the years to come,” the statement added.
