PUCSL to meet next week to decide on CEB’s electricity tariffs revision proposal

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) is scheduled to convene a meeting on February 28 to discuss the proposal for tariffs reduction submitted by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).

A PUCSL spokesperson said the final decision on the electricity tariffs revision proposal would be taken on that day.

The state-owned electricity supplier’s proposal to reduce electricity charges was handed over to the PUCSL on February 22.

Kanchana Wijesekera, the Minister of Power and Energy, recently told the parliament that the CEB expects to reduce the rates by at least the same rates and percentages increased in October 2023.

In October last year, the electricity tariffs were raised by 18% for domestic and religious places of worship, by 12% for industries and hotels and by 24% for government institutions.
