Resilient ComBank maintains growth impetus in Q2 despite external pressures

Characteristically agile and proactive responses to market-specific dynamics have enabled the Commercial Bank of Ceylon Group to achieve commendable growth in the first half of 2024, despite a reduced topline.

The Group, comprising of Sri Lanka’s biggest private sector bank, its subsidiaries and an associate, has reported gross income of Rs 163.12 billion for the six months ending 30th June 2024, a decline of 2.71% over the corresponding period of 2023. However, gross income for the second quarter, at Rs 82.91 billion, was down only by a marginal 0.73%, reflecting an improvement over the first quarter.

The reduction in gross income was attributed to reduced interest income due to lower market interest rates on loans and government securities compared to 2023. Interest income for the six months under review amounted to Rs 139.26 billion, a drop of 7.66%, but with interest expenses for the same period reducing by 28.86% to Rs 80.64 billion as a result of an improvement in the Bank’s CASA ratio and repricing of deposits, net interest income grew by 56.53% to Rs 58.62 billion.
