Dilith pledges to deliver the change people have been hoping for

The presidential candidate of the ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ alliance, entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera urged voters to make use of this opportunity to bring about the change desired by the people.

Addressing a public rally held in Yatiyanthota today (17), he stated that the “corrupt politics” of this country must end and that the innocent people of this country cannot be made to suffer any more. “For that, you asked for a change. That’s why you said no to all 225.”

“We helped the politicians thinking that they could fix this country one day, but they kept betraying us,” he said.

Jayaweera stated that he entered into politics after declaring his assets. “The other candidates have also given asset declarations. The first three claim to have incomes of less than Rs. 200,000. What a sad situation.”

The ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ candidate said they are engaged in a new form of politics by “taking responsibility for every word we say.” He stated that their strategic plan details how to create the Sri Lanka that the people wanted. “No one can say a word against it today,” he added.

“That’s why we started a journey by gathering Sri Lankans who love this country. We want to give you the change you’ve been hoping for.”

He further stated that they have a program that answers the questions of Sri Lanka’s youth who are leaving the country.
