NBRO warns landslide threats may persist despite reduced rainfall

NBRO Director-General Eng. (Dr.) Asiri Karunawardena says 10 districts still under threat, 14,500 families identified as living in high-risk areas

Urges public to remain vigilant, not to return to homes till NBRO officially changes warnings

Says early public awareness helped to reduce number of deaths, casualties

National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) Director-General Engineer (Dr.) Asiri Karunawardena yesterday said that the “red alert” warning for landslide-prone areas might be extended, even if rainfall decreases today (4).

Addressing a special media briefing organised by the Government Information Department, he said 10 districts are still under threat with around 14,500 families having been identified as living in high-risk areas. Karunawardena requested residents in these areas to remain vigilant and heed landslide warnings.

“I urge the public not to return to their homes until the NBRO officially changes the landslide warnings, as soil water levels may still be dangerously high,” he cautioned. He also advised the public to be cautious about retaining and boundary walls once water levels recede.

“The number of landslide-related incidents is expected to increase over the next few days,” he added.

As of Monday morning, at least 51 landslides and earth embankment collapses have been reported, particularly in the Ratnapura, Kegalle, Kalutara, Matara, Galle, Gampaha and Colombo districts, where rainfall has ranged from 150 to 400 mm over the past few days.

Karunawardena disclosed four deaths due to landslides – two in the Matara district and two in the Ratnapura district.

However, he highlighted that early warnings and public awareness have helped reduce the number of deaths and injuries compared to similar flood incidents in 2017.

“Public awareness and preparedness measures taken by Government agencies have played a crucial role this time. Going forward, we must aim for a zero deaths and casualty ratio,” Karunawardena said.
