Central Mail Exchange employees to strike over broken elevator

The employees of the Central Mail Exchange in Colombo have decided to launch a 24-hour token strike from midnight today (10 March).

Speaking at a media briefing held today, the United Postal Trade Unions Front (UPTUF) stated that the strike is being launched in view of the failure to repair the elevator at the building, which has been inoperable for almost one year.

They explained that nearly 40% of the female employees, including pregnant women, face difficulties due to this, adding that the Central Mail Exchange is an eight-storied building, therefore making it a rather difficult task to move around mail bags.

Thus, the UPTUF warned that if the government fails to resolve the matter within a month, the trade union action will continue.
