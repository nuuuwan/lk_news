USAID program prevents plastic entering ocean around Sri Lanka

ECONOMYNEXT – A 1.2 million dollar program by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) helped prevent over 4,600 metric tons of plastic from entering the ocean around Sri Lanka, USAID said.

The Clean Cities, Blue Ocean (CCBO) program launched in Sri Lanka in 2021 sought to address ocean plastic pollution.

USAID “partnered with local organizations to design and pilot innovative, economically viable, and environmentally sustainable solutions to address each step in the waste value chain, providing technical assistance and grants totaling more than 1.2 million US dollars (Rs 382.8 million),” it said in a statement.

As a result of these partnerships, 625,000 Sri Lankans benefitted from improved solid waste services, and communities around Colombo, Galle, and Jaffna have adopted sustainable practices that promote increased reuse and transformation of waste products into new items, USAID said.

“The United States is helping Sri Lanka improve management of its natural resources to build resilience and insulate the country from the harms of climate change,” said Dennis Wesner, deputy director of Economic Growth for USAID Sri Lanka and Maldives. (Colombo/Jan30/2024)
