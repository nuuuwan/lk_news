Mystique Fusion…

The Sri Lanka Muslim Association (women’s branch), in Southern California, is back in action…after a long break, mainly due to the pandemic.

They generally work on charity projects, for the benefit of Sri Lankans back home.

Before the pandemic cropped up, they did a charity project for the Cancer Hospital, Maharagama.

This year, too, they are doing it for the children at the Cancer Hospital Maharagama.
