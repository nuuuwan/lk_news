Kabir urges Gota to withdraw allegations of conspiracy by minorities

Emphasises historical loyalty of Muslims in Sri Lanka to country’s rulers

Warns that Gota’s claims could distort historical facts and create false impressions for future generations

Asserts that Gota’s claim of minority groups including Muslims of conspiring against him are baseless

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Kabir Hashim in Parliament last week called on former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to withdraw the allegation made in his book “The Conspiracy”, where he accused minority groups in the country, including Muslims, Tamils, and Catholics, of plotting to force him out of office.

Hashim said Rajapaksa must foremostly study history. He said Muslims in Sri Lanka have never betrayed Sinhala Buddhist Kings or rulers of the past and have always worked to protect them.

Hashim cited historical instances, recounting the story of a woman named Fathima from a village in Mahiyanganaya. He recounted how she sheltered Sri Vikrama Rajasinha when the British were searching for him, hiding him inside the hollow of a tree. He said despite the threat of execution by the British, she remained steadfast and did not betray him which eventually led to her death.

The MP noted that in recent times, Muslim Moulavis have travelled to Geneva to address the UNHRC against the war crimes allegations against Sri Lanka. He highlighted that Muslim nations voted in support of Sri Lanka at the UNHRC without imposing any conditions.

Hashim emphasised that Rajapaksa’s claim could potentially mislead and create a false impression if left uncorrected, affecting perceptions in the future. He stressed the importance of rectifying such statements.

Hashim said Rapaksa is putting on an act to cover up the wrongs he committed against the country. “This is a lie, a myth. How can minorities oust him?” Hashim asked.

The MP accused Rajapaksa of attempting to gain power in 2019 through both legitimate and illegitimate means. He highlighted that this suspicion persists due to the Government’s failure to hold those responsible accountable. Instead, Rajapaksa is now accused of scapegoating minorities, the MP noted.

The MP recalled Rajapaksa’s engagement in divisive politics leading up to the polls in 2019, which fostered a belief among the majority that the minorities were to blame for the country’s woes. Hashim noted that however, Rajapaksa’s policy decisions led to the downfall of Sinhalese businessmen, farmers and others who then commenced the people’s struggle against his rule who were later joined by the minorities.

He noted that Rajapaksa was provided safety by The Maldives, a Muslim country when he was ousted.

“Muslims as a community did not work to oust Rajapaksa,” he said. The MP said Rajapaksa was ousted due to karma for the actions carried out by him, such as forced cremations of Muslims.

“It cannot be accepted that anyone conspired to oust him. If any mistake was made in the book it must be corrected or it will go down in history incorrectly,” the MP urged.
