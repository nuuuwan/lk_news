Ex-CBSL chief Cabraal and 3 others released from 2012 Greek bonds case

The Colombo High Court today (31) ordered the release of former Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) Ajith Nivard Cabraal and three other defendants in a case filed against them alleging financial losses caused to the government of Sri Lanka through investments in Greek treasury bonds in 2012.

The attorneys who appeared on behalf of the former CBSL chief had raised objections that the relevant case filed by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) cannot be maintained.

The Colombo High Court Judge Adithya Patabendige, who accepted the relevant objections ordered the release of Ajith Nivard Cabraal and the co-defendants of the case.

The defendants were accused of causing a loss of over Rs. 1.8 billion to the Sri Lankan government through the Greek T-bond investments in 2012.

On 03 May 2024, Cabraal’s attorneys raised preliminary objections, leading to today’s decision to dismiss the case and the release of the defendants.
