Thousands of buses operative for people to return from hometowns after Avurudu

The number of buses in operation across the country has been increased to facilitate the return of people who visited their hometowns for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, says the Private Bus Ownersâ€™ Association.

According to the president of the association Gemunu Wijeratne, as many as 9,000 buses are up and running today island-wide.

Meanwhile, the General Manager of Railway N. J. Indipolage said the train operations also returned to normalcy today.

His comments came after some 11 commuter trains were cancelled on Tuesday (16) due to the lack of locomotive engine operators and train guards who had not reported to work after the traditional New Year festivities.
