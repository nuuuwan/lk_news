Sri Lanka ‘free’ visa costs US$21.61 under VFS Global deal: legislator

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s ‘free’ visas issued to several countries are being charged 21 US dollars by VFS Global, a private contractor hired without competitive tender, opposition legislator Nalin Bandara said.

“Visa cost is zero. Then here is a service free of 18.50 for a free visa,” Bandara told parliament Wednesday. “There is another charge for 3.11 dollars.

“So they are taking 21.65 dollars for a gratis visa when a tourist comes to Sri Lanka. When we go to Singapore we get a free visa. So nothing is charged from us. Not a single dollar is charged as a service fee.”

Bandara claimed companies have been incorporated in the UAE to do the deal with Sri Lanka.

Bandara questioned why the deal was given to VFS Global when Mobitel had offered to do the system for 1 dollar.

“A massive game is being played,” Bandara said. “This government has a life of 4 months. Are they going to collect money in their death?”

A double entry visa that used to cost 50 dollars in Sri Lanka which was issued through user-friendly website, initially went up to 100.77 dollars after the VFS Global deal.

According to a report compiled by an additional secretary VFS Global was projected to earn 841 dollars from the deal in the next 10 year, Bandara said.
