Ravi K defends NDF National List appointment

MP Ravi Karunanayake yesterday attended the inaugural session of the 10th Parliament as the National List appointment of the New Democratic Front (NDF).

Speaking to the media, he affirmed that his appointment via the NDF’s National List was legal, insisting that he was rightfully nominated by the party.

“It is just two members who are making a big fuss over my nomination, not the entire party,” he claimed, commenting on the controversy surrounding his nomination as the NDF National List candidate.

MP Karunanayake argued that as a senior member of the United National Party (UNP) he has sacrificed a lot and underwent many challenges for the betterment of the party. “We cannot sacrifice our party for the benefit of mere 2-3% of people. Those who know, know,” he said.  Karunanayake said once the agreements that were agreed by the parties are released to the public domain, it will answer many of these questions.

“My focus right now is on rebuilding the UNP and steering it back to strength,” he stressed.
