Gevorg Sargsyan new World Bank Group Country Manager for Sri Lanka

ECONOMYNEXT – Gevorg Sargsyan has been appointed the World Bank Group Country Manager for Sri Lanka, with effect from July 1.

This newly created position will provide a single point of contact for access to the full breadth of World Bank Group products and services, the Washington-based lender said in a statement.

“My priority is to strengthen the dynamic collaboration among the Bank Group institutions in Sri Lanka, to improve our speed and make us a better partner to the government, the private sector, and the Sri Lankan people to support in overcoming the current challenges and building a prosperous and resilient country,” Sargsyan said.

“Sri Lanka is navigating a unique set of challenges, marked by its journey towards economic recovery, heightened poverty and the impacts of climate change, all of which necessitate substantial reforms to protect its economy and people.”

Sargsyan, an Armenian national, joined the World Bank in 2000, bringing over two decades of diverse experience to the role.

He has served as Country Manager and Manager of Operations in Europe, Central Asia and East Asia, as well as Program Manager for Climate Finance and as Global Lead for Clean Energy.

Sri Lanka is one of 21 World Bank Group offices transitioning to a single World Bank Group Country Manager or Resident Representative for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), International Development Association (IDA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).
