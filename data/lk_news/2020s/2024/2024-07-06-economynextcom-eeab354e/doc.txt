Sri Lanka says 1.3mn register for tax number in June, targets 7.4mn

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s State Minister of Finance has said that 2.3 million people have got Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) so far, with 1.3 million in June alone.

The government’s aim was to increase the number of people who have been given TIN numbers to 7.3 million by the end of July, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

“If you are asked to pay tax but do not have income, do not pay tax,” he told TIN registrants.

Siyambalapitiya said that even if the Inland Revenue Department sent letters or text messages asking people who have obtained a TIN to pay taxes, if their monthly income does not exceed the threshold limit of 100,000 rupees the local revenue department should be informed. (Colombo/Jul5/2024)
