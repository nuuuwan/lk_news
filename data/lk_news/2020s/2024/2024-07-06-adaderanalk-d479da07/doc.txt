Electrical leak caused massive fire in Akurana?

Police suspect that the cause of the fire that broke out at a restaurant in Akurana may have been an electrical leak in the system supplying electricity to the electric ovens in a bakery located in the building.

The Kandy-Matale road (A9) was temporarily closed at Akurana yesterday morning (05) due to a fire that broke out in a shop and spread to several adjacent shops and an international school in the vicinity.

The flames were brought under control by around 10:00 a.m. after much effort by firefighters and local residents.

However, the Akurana Police are conducting further investigations regarding the incident.
