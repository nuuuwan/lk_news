CBK back in the fray to lead SLFP-LED People’s Alliance

Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has reinstated the membership of former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, enabling her to lead the party-dominated Podujana Eksath Peramuna (People’s Alliance), the Daily Mirror learns.

SLFP leader former President Maithripala Sirisena has already informed Ms. Kumaratunga about the membership reinstatement. The party has now decided to revive the People’s Alliance under its chair symbol. The alliance was originally formed ahead of the general election in 1994 as a move to defeat the 17-year rule of the United National Party (UNP). The People’s Alliance remained in power until 2001 when it was defeated by the UNP again.

In 2004, the SLFP took the lead in forming the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA).

Since then, the People’s Alliance remained idle in politics. In what appeared to be a new political development ahead of the presidential elections, it will be revived with Ms. Kumaratunga as the leader.

However, all decisions will be taken by the Leadership Council to be formed in due course. At a recent meeting, the People’s Alliance decided to amend its constitution enabling various independent groups to join it in addition to recognized political parties. According to the previous constitution, the SLFP, as the key ally, held 51 percent stake in the People’s Alliance. It is now going to be reduced to 50 per cent.
