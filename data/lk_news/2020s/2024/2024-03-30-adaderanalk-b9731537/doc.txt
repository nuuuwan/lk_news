Man arrested as hostage situation in Dutch nightclub ends

A hostage situation at a nightclub in an eastern Dutch town has come to an end after a man was arrested.

Four people had been taken hostage when he entered Café Petticoat, in Ede, early on Saturday morning threatening to blow himself up, local media said.

Armed police evacuated the area, but said there was “no indication of a terrorist motive”.

An initial group of three people were released, and the fourth emerged after some time.

The hostages are all employees, the owner told de Telegraaf newspaper.

Residents in about 150 homes around the area have been evacuated and the town centre has been closed down.

Anti-explosives units and police in protective gear were pictured at the scene.

Trains to and from Ede were cancelled, railway operator NS said on its website.
