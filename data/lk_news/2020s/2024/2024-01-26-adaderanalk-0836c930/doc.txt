President Ranil Wickremesinghe has urged all political parties to formulate a comprehensive plan for rebuilding the country, especially when gearing up for the elections.

Addressing an event at the Sri Lanka Customs headquarters in Colombo this morning, the Head of State emphasized that the nation’s economy has suffered due to the ‘politics of promises’.

The event was organized to mark International Customs Day observed annually on January 26, the President’s Media Division (PMD) said.

Further, addressing the gathering, the President appealed to the political parties to unite for discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on potential alternative proposals.

He also expressed his readiness to extend an invitation to IMF’s Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva to visit Sri Lanka for this crucial dialogue.
