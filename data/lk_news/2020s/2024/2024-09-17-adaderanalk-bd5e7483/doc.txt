Dilith proposes “Hithe Haiya” program to replace welfare schemes

The presidential candidate of the “Sarvajana Balaya” alliance, entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera, says that they have planned to implement a new program called “Hithe Haiya” instead of the various welfare schemes that have been provided to the people thus far.

He made these remarks while participating in a rally held in Monaragala.

“The welfare schemes that have been deceiving you all along first came as ‘Janasaviya.’ Then came ‘Samurdhi.’ Then came ‘Aswesuma.’ But now your eyes are open. We have presented the ‘Hithe Haiya’ program,” he said.

Jayaweera stated that the ‘Hithe Haiya’ program is designed to end those programs that turned people into ‘beggars’ and made them dependent on politicians.

“We declare that your household’s minimum income should be Rs. 100,000, and we firmly state that Rs. 100,000 will be provided,” he said.

He further explained that a specific schedule has been outlined in this program, and they have also prepared a plan to encourage and uplift ‘Samurdhi’ officers, in order to double their income.

“There is only one thing left to do. You’ll be given a pencil and paper. My name is the tenth in the ballot paper. Mark an ‘X’ in front of it. A day victorious for you all will come. A star will shine in the sky. To become a star, vote for the star,” he said.
