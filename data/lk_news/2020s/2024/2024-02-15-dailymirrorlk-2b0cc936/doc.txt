There is no constitutional provision to postpone Presidential election: CBK

Colombo, Feb 14 (Daily Mirror) - There is no constitutional provision to postpone Presidential elections, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga told journalists yesterday.

Ms. Kumaratunga said this in response to a question raised by journalists after an event organized by the United Republic Front in Colombo last evening.

However, she did declined to elaborate to a question raised by journalists on the assurance given by the President’s office recently that Presidential elections will be held despite speculation that the Executive Presidency is to be scrapped.

“All I can say is that Presidential elections cannot be postponed at all,” she added.
