Three minor staff members remanded over assault incident at Karapitiya Hospital

Three minor staff members of the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital including a female, who were arrested in connection with a complaint by the hospital’s senior oncologist alleging assault, have been remanded in custody until 29 January 2024.

The order was issued by the Galle Magistrate’s Court after the arrested suspects were produced before the court, Ada Derana reporter said.

Earlier, the Galle Police had arrested three minor staff members including a female of the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital this morning (21) over an alleged assault to the senior oncologist of the hospital.

The senior oncologist in question, Dr. Krishantha Perera, 61, was also arrested on 18 January for purportedly assaulting a female junior staff member during a contentious situation that had ensued the previous morning.

He was accused of assaulting the said staff member during a heated argument between him and the other junior staffers after he slammed them for disrupting hospital services by going on a token strike the day before.

The hospital’s authorities had brought the situation under control, however, a female junior staff member got herself admitted to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, claiming an assault by the senior oncologist who was subsequently arrested and remanded until January 22 on the orders of the Galle Magistrate.
