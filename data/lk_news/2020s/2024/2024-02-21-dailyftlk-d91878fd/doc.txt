Royal College Principal reacts to Daily FT article and Padmasena Dissanayake responds

Open Letter to the Education Ministry over alleged anti-secular activities at Royal College

The Daily FT last week (https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Open-letter-to-Education-Ministry-Secretary-over-Royal-College-anti-secular-activities/14-758546) published an Open Letter to the Education Ministry over alleged anti-secular activities at the Royal College, Colombo. The Royal College Principal had reacted to this article via electronic and social media. The Daily FT didn’t get a

direct response from the Royal College Principal. Given the importance, today the Daily FT publishes Royal College Principal’s responses and the rebuttal by the original author Padmasena

I refer to an article published in the Daily FT recently, levelling certain allegations regarding the annual multi-religious programme and alms-giving activities at Royal College.

The standard practice to reply to an article is to write to the Editor of the same publication and ask for this reply being given the same publicity that was given to the original. Why hasn’t this happened?

As the Principal of Royal College, I feel compelled to address these accusations and provide clarity on the matter.

It is important to note that the annual multi-religious programme and alms-giving have been long standing traditions at Royal College, spanning numerous years.

Request for funds has mentioned only the pirith ceremony. Does this event involve attendance from Hindu, Muslim and Christian Priests and doing their religious preaching in addition to pirith – in equal time slots? If not, how can you call it a multi-religious programme?

According to the principal, this has been going on for a long time. Would like to know when did the grand scale pirith ceremony collecting millions of rupees start? How many years has this been happening? Can you please provide income and expenditure accounts for the last three years?

These events are deeply rooted in our school’s ethos of secularism and fostering harmony and understanding among students of diverse backgrounds.

To me secularism means not being connected or affiliated to any religion. This is a core value of Royal. It was started and managed for over 150 years without any affiliation to any religion. That’s the long-standing tradition of Royal; not religious functions or affiliations.

Education is important; and the Principal of Royal is no exception. I would suggest the Principal to study the history of Royal from the beginning in 1835 so he could learn the core values of what Royal stands for. Further, studying the history of the Royal would enlighten him that most of the initial Principals were Christian Priests. However, they didn’t taint secularism at school by bringing in their religion to school. They kept their religion outside the Boake Gates. This is unique to Royal College unlike other schools of prominence during colonial times. If you look at St. Thomas’ or Trinity, they have chapels inside school premises; Royal doesn’t. We were unique. However, in the recent past, the school authorities have damaged the long-standing tradition by erecting Buddhist symbols across school premises.

According to the principal, the religious events are deep rooted in our ethos of secularism. I am confused and unable to understand his statement as the very meaning of secularism is the total opposite of what he states.

Contrary to the claims made in the article, it should be noted that while there are indeed 186 classes in the school, money is not collected from every class. Such assertions misrepresent the financial practices associated with these events.

The Principal doesn’t deny the collection of money. He only contradicts the number of classes money is collected from. Though he lacks knowledge of Royal values, he is to be commended for admitting collection of funds.

If money is not collected from 186 classes, from how many classes was money collected?

Was the money collection done strictly in accordance with the Ministry of Education circulars?

Additionally, the distribution of Atapirikara to 100 Bhikkus is conducted on a voluntary basis, by parents willing to contribute to this meaningful gesture. No coercion or force is involved in this process, and parents are free to participate or refrain, according to their discretion.

What assurance can the Principal give that the children of parents who don’t contribute are not targeted by certain teachers (of course, not all teachers are involved in these types of activities)? The word voluntary basis in my view is misleading. In this instance it is actually implied coercion!

Did the Principal make an open appeal to the parents for donations for Atapirikara? Can evidence be produced?

The sponsorship of food for grades one to four students is also voluntary. It is inaccurate to insinuate that only financially capable parents have assumed responsibility for this initiative.

It’s not true to say, “food for grades one to four students”. No food is provided for students of grades one to four. It’s actually dinner for the participants at the pirith ceremony.

Were the sponsorships from corporations or parents? Can a list of donors and the amounts donated be provided?

Furthermore, the comparison drawn between Royal College and Buddhist colleges, such as Ananda College and Nalanda College, regarding participation in religious processions is misleading.

I attended Royal College from ‘67-’74 and spent my senior years at Reid Avenue when it was the only secular school in a land already experiencing regular, brutal and ugly communal violence. I have the highest admiration for the secular values that were the norm at school during my time. Though I am a Buddhist deeply immersed in the teaching of the Enlightened One, I am deeply shocked and dismayed when I visit the college now with omnipresent Buddhist religious symbols such as a Bo tree, Buddhist flags, bodhi prakaraya, Awasa geya for Bhikku-Teachers and religious collection boxes in school premises. Classes have Buddha statues (sometimes more than one) and students practice Buddhist rituals at the start of the class where students from multi religions attend the same class.

Christian, Hindu and Muslim children don’t get the same privilege of practicing their religion at the start of the school every day. This is not secular, this is not fair and this is not Royal College. This can only happen in an ultra-religious Buddhist school like the Vidyalayas mentioned above. Therefore, my comparison stands true.

According to the Principal, Royal College has remained a secular school. Then, how can there be Buddhist symbols scattered all over?

Further, I would like to know the number of Buddhist symbols scattered around the school (excluding the statues inside classrooms because the list may never end!)

I reiterate that Royal College is a secular school and takes pride in conducting multi religious ceremonies with the participation of students and parents from all faiths. This is a testament to our commitment to secularism, inclusivity and cultural diversity.

None needs to “reiterate” secular values with so-called Buddhist or multi religious ceremonies. Religious ceremonies do not reiterate secular values; it destroys the secular values!

He reiterates that Royal is a secular school. If so, when is he going to get rid of all the religious symbols sprouting all over? By doing so he can prove he is committed to the secular values at Royal.

It is disheartening to see baseless allegations made by an individual purportedly associated with our esteemed institution.

As the Principal, I am readily available to provide factual information and address any concerns raised regarding our school’s activities. It is regrettable that false accusations have been made, tarnishing the reputation of our institution, which serves as a home for students of all backgrounds and faiths.

Further, I would like to ask the Principal the following questions (hoping he would readily and enthusiastically respond as promised!):

Did the school management have meetings with class treasurers on collection of money for the pirith ceremony? (Class treasurer is a parent appointed from each class as a proxy to collect money on behalf of school management without directly involving the school)

Did the school management refuse to issue official requests seeking funds for the pirith ceremony?

Why were some class treasurers instructed to return the funds collected after my article got published in DFT?

Since the publication of the article, are your representatives going around collecting letters from parents declaring their contributions were made voluntarily?

Why was the Ministry of Education approved due process of collection of money not followed by your delegates on this occasion?

Have you provided official receipts for the money already collected? What official bank accounts have the money been transferred to?

Please explain the fund collection policy of the school from parents regarding school events.

Please explain why your deputies and sectional heads insist strictly and exclusively on verbal communications when collecting funds.

School buildings and premises maintenance is very poor. It seems like no repairs have been done on most buildings since the 1990s. It makes me sad to see the dilapidated buildings the children have to study. As the Principal, why don’t you prioritise renovating the buildings of the school rather than collecting money from parents and wasting them on meaningless extravaganzas?

Navarangahala badly needs repairs. It generates income to the school when outsiders hire it. Why don’t you prioritise repairs of Navarangahala instead of wasting millions of rupees on a pirith ceremony?

nYou are declaring that you are always prepared and willing to clarify and explain matters related to Royal College. Soon after your assuming duties I informed you of the biggest financial fraud that happened in a Sri Lankan school amounting to over Rs. 17 million which was well-covered from the public eye for seven years. It’s not only I who clamoured for immediate action but scores of very distinguished senior alumni from Eastern Australia to Western USA. And to date you have remained silent. Words have no meanings Sir, until you put them into action!
