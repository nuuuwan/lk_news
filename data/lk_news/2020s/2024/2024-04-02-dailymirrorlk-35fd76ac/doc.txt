Railways to remove hazardous trees along Galabada-Hatton line

The Railways Department has decided to remove the dangerous trees on both sides of the railway line between Galabada and Hatton, Railways Superintendent S. Godage said.

He said in the past three months, the upcountry railway line has been obstructed due to falling trees on nine occasions.

Therefore, necessary activities are being carried out to cut and remove dangerous trees along the upcountry railway line before the rainy weather that may occur in the central mountains in the future.
