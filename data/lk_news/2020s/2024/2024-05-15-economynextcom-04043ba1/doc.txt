Sri Lanka govt extends military benefits for CDF ahead of polls

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka government has decided to extend the same benefits given to war time army to Civil Defence Force (CDF), State Defence Minister Premitha Bandara Tennakoon said, ahead of the island nation declare the Presidential polls.

The presidential election date is expected to be declared after July 17, but the Election Commission has already declared that the polls will be held between September 17 and October 16.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is also the country’s Defence Minister, is expected to contest under an independent common coalition with the support most parties backing him in the current government, his close allies have said.

Backing of currently serving military and retired armed forces is vital for any political leader to win a presidency, analysts say.

Sri Lanka had around 33,000 members in the Civil Defence Force in 2023 when Wickremesinghe government proposed an early retirement scheme for the entire CDF due to the 20 billion rupee yearly cost of maintaining it amid lack of duties with many staying home earning salaries

“We have decided to provide wages and payments to the service personnel beyond 55 years under Civil Security Department,” Tennakoon told reporters in Colombo at a media briefing on Wednesday (15).

“This means close relative like wife, mother or father of those CDF members who died during the war and those disabled will receive the wage until 55 years.”

“President and Defence Ministry also have focused on those who have are facing economic difficulties after reaching 55 years. Accordingly, we expect to provide the benefits to them,” he said.

“Already died military personnel are receiving these benefits. The CDF not receiving the same benefits is problematic. So, we expect to submit a cabinet paper to obtain the cabinet approval with regard to this.” (Colombo/May 15/2024)
