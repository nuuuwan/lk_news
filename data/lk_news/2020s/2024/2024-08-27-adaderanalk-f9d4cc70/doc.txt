Showers expected in parts of the country

A few showers may occur in Western, Sabaragamuwa and North-western provinces and in Galle and Matara districts, says the Department of Meteorology.

Showers or thundershowers may occur at a few places in Badulla, Ampara and Batticaloa districts during the evening or night. Mainly fair weather prevail elsewhere, it said.

Fairly strong winds of about 30-40 kmph can be expected at times over Northern, North-central and North-western provinces and in Hambantota and Trincomalee districts.

The general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
