Police seeks INTERPOL help to nab Kanjipani Imran

Police have confirmed, it has requested the support of the International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL) to nab and repatriate organised crime boss Mohamed Najim Mohamed Imran, better known as “Kanjipani Imran’.

According to Police Spokesperson DIG Nihal Thalduwa the INTERPOL has already issued a red notice for Kanjipani Imran’s arrest.

However, DIG Thalduwa emphasised that the support and cooperation of the country where the criminal is currently residing are essential for his extradition.

Reports have suggested that the recent killing of Sunhill Group of Companies Chairperson Surendra Wasantha Perera was carried out on the orders of Kanjipani Imran.

Kanjipani Imran had fled to Dubai in 2015 due to threats on his life by a rival gang. He was arrested by the Dubai Police in 2019 along with notorious underworld figure Samarasinghe Arachchilage Madhush Lakshitha, also known as Makandure Madush before being repatriated to Sri Lanka.

In August 2019, the Colombo High Court sentenced Kanjipani Imran to six years of hard labour after he pleaded guilty to drug possession and trafficking, receiving three years for each charge.

In 2022, he was granted bail in a case involving death threats against a police officer. Following this, he allegedly fled to India and subsequently to France.
