Time allocated for debate on Electricity Amendment Bill to be extended

Parliament, June 6 (Daily Mirror)- The time allocated for the Parliamentary debate on the Electricity Amendment Bill is to be extended following the requests by Opposition MPs.

The final decision on the extension will be made at the party leaders' meeting to be held at 1pm today.

An uproar was seen earlier in Parliament today when the Opposition wanted more time forÂ  the debate on the Electricity Amendment Bill in order to study the amendments and the Supreme Court determination.

The uproar began when MP Nalaka Bandara Kottegoda said the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Power and Energy had given the green light for the legislation subject to amendments.

MP Charitha Herath who responded said a decent space of time should be given to MPs to study the legislation as per Standing Orders 50(2). He said this situation should be taken into consideration.

MP Chandima Weerakody said the Supreme Court determination which said the legislation is inconsistent with Article 12 (1) of the Constitution should be taken into consideration.

Minister of Power and Energy Kachnana Wijesekera said the Supreme Court had given the green light for the Bill provided the amendments it had proposed are accommodated and therefore the House could go ahead and approve it.

Leader of the House Susil Premajayantha said the party leaders could meet and decide on extending the time for the debate.

Accordingly the party leaders are expected to decide at 1pm today.
