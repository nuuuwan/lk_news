Central Environment Authority investigating into ship carrying toxic wastes from US: Minister

Parliament, April 2 (Daily Mirror)- The Central Environment Authority (CEA) has launched a comprehensive investigation into the incident where a Singapore cargo ship was carrying hazardous materials to Sri Lanka from the US, State Minister of Environment Janaka Wakkumbura said today.

He told Parliament that the CEA was unaware that the cargo ship carrying hazardous materials was heading to Sri Lanka.

The Minister said this while responding to a question raised by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, who asked the government's reaction to the media reports on the Singapore cargo ship Dali chartered by Maersk, which crashed onto the Baltimore, US bridge on March 26, carrying 764 tons of hazardous materials.

The Opposition Leader said a proper investigation should be conducted as to how such a cargo ship carrying hazardous materials was heading to Sri Lanka without the knowledge of the country.

"We would not have known of the hazardous material in the cargo ship unless it encountered an accident. A proper investigation should be conducted as to how such a ship was heading to Sri Lanka in such a manner," he said.

Minister Wakkumbura admitted the fact that Sri Lanka would not have known of the hazardous material in the cargo ship if not for the accident encountered by the ship.

He said Sri Lanka Customs and the Colombo Port have been informed of cargo ship and assured to provide a report to the House of the incident.
