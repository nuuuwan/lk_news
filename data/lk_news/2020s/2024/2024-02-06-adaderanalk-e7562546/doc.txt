Sri Lanka to import 15,000 tonnes of cashew nuts in shell

The Cabinet of Ministers has granted approval to import 15,000 tonnes of cashew nuts in shell since the country’s annual requirement of cashew nuts in shell has not been met due to the fact that the crops have not been harvested as expected in the last season.

Joining the Cabinet press conference held in Colombo today (06), Cabinet Spokesperson Minister Bandula Gunawardena said that the country’s annual requirement of cashew nuts in shell is around 25,000 Metric Tonnes.

However, currently only 12,500 tonnes of cashew nuts can be procured locally and the cashew industry in the country is facing a very unfortunate situation as the crop has not been harvested as expected in the last season, according to the Minister.

Therefore, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved the proposal presented by the Minister of Agriculture and Plantation to import a maximum of 15,000 tonnes of cashew nuts in shell for this year and then to import a quantity determined by a committee consisting of senior officials of the relevant ministries during the period from December to April when the local cashew harvest is not available in the next 4 years.
