PTE Core is the latest addition to the Pearson Test of English (PTE) suite of exams, which opens doors for foreign study, employment and migration opportunities, particularly to Canada. Alongside the launch, a partner meet was also held for Pearson’s key agents and partners in Sri Lanka. During the event, which was held at Shangri-La Colombo, officials from Pearson South Asia took the opportunity to highlight the valuable contributions of its Sri Lankan agents and celebrate their achievements.

A number of distinguished dignitaries and key stakeholders were present at the event, including the Canadian High Commission Political and Trade Counsellor Daneil Bood, and Pearson South Asia Employability and Qualifications Director Premila Paulraj. Their participation served to highlight the potential of PTE Core in facilitating language proficiency to better harness opportunities for work and migration to Canada.

By the end of 2022, over 300,000 people had left the country, many of them professionals. These individuals are looking for greener pastures and a way to support their families. It said a key obstacle facing potential migrants is English language proficiency assessment, which is a key requirement for migration to popular destinations such as Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand and many other countries.
