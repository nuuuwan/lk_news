He emphasized the need for fresh perspectives in the wake of the country’s worst economic crisis, which has led to significant brain drain.

This year’s National Conference hopes to inspire young leaders to fearlessly embrace the fast-evolving future and encourage them to go beyond the customary realm in pursuit of excellence, Kuruppu explained.

The challenges we face today can be used as opportunities to propel ourselves further. For the past 45 years, the National Conference of Chartered Accountants has been a harbinger of change, serving as a guiding light to the nation’s movers and shakers, he noted.
