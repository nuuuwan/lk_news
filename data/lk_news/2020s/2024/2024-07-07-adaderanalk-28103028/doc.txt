MOE to extend interest-free loans to students who passed A/Ls

The Ministry of Education (MOE) is actively progressing with the implementation of a programme to offer interest-free loans to students who passed the 2022 G.C.E. Advanced Level (A/L) Examination.

This initiative, aligning with the 2017 budget proposals, aims support students who did not qualify for admission to state universities, in order to follow courses in private higher education institutions.

Eligible students can avail themselves of interest-free loans up to a maximum of Rs. 800,000.

According to the ministry, a total of 17,313 students across seven student groups have already received loans to pursue 100 degree courses offered by 17 approved non-government higher education institutions.

The ministry has now invited proposals for courses from these institutions for the upcoming eighth batch of students who passed the A/L exam in 2022.
