LTL to pay interest after Sri Lanka regulator halts IPO

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s LTL Holdings said it will pay interest to applicants of an initial public offer which was halted by the regulator pending an interim court order.

The IPO was initially halted pending disclosure of matters including a court case.

The hearing of the court case and possible interim relief is due on October 11.

The SEC has ordered that the IPO be put on hold “until the Supreme Court makes a ruling on the interim relief as sought by the petitioner in SC/FR/Application No. 263/2024.”

LTL said applications already made could be withdrawn or kept till a fresh date for opening of the IPO is decided:

“The Company will pay interest at a rate of 10.49% p.a. (which is the 91-days Treasury Bill rate published by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka on 19th September 2024) from 10th September 2024 or the date of transfer of application monies, whichever is latest, until;

(i) the opening date of the subscription list is decided by the Company (in the event the Applicant has instructed the Registrars to the Issue to retain the Application as valid), OR, (ii) the date the application monies / bank draft are returned / dispatched to the Applicant (in the event the Applicant instructs the Registrars to the Issue to have their Applications withdrawn). Interest will be credited to the bank account.” (Colombo/Oct7/2024
