Divesting SOEs can generate greater profits through taxation: Sri Lanka restructuring unit

ECONOMYNEXT – Some profitable state-owned enterprises are being divested because the government can generate far greater profits through taxation, Sri Lanka’s SOE restructuring unit has said.

“Taxes yield greater benefit to the public with far less financial cost and resources, burdening the country,” SOERU, established under the Ministry of Finance, said on its social media page X (twitter).

“The result is a healthier stronger economy and better governance.”

Sri Lanka has a total of 527 State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), according to its public finance department.

These have been used by politicians to give ‘jobs for the boys’, appropriate vehicles for personal use, fill boards of directors and key positions with henchmen and relatives, according to critics.

There have also been high profile procurement scandals connected to SOEs.

Last week, Sri Lanka passed a new Electricity Act which will enable the state-owned power utility, Ceylon Electricity Board, to be restructured.

Sri Lanka expects to conclude all transactions related to divestiture of SOEs by August this year under an ambitious reform process recommended by the International Monetary Fund. The divestiture of loss-making Srilankan Airlines is likely to be concluded later.

The feedback from unions in Sri Lanka’s state enterprises listed for divestment was to find good investors and to ensure that jobs were not lost, Director General of Sri Lanka’s SOE Restructuring Unit Suresh Shah has said.

SOE’s are a significant part of the world Economy. In 40 countries 2,467 commercially oriented enterprises valued at over USD 2.4 trillion employ 9.2 million people, SOERU said. (Colombo/Jun10/2024)
