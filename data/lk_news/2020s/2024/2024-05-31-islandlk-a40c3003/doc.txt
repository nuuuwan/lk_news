“The Board of Directors of the company has made arrangements for this purpose with Aitken Spence PLC, MJ F Holdings (Private) Limited, and D. A. de S. Wickramanayake, three largest shareholders of the company (the “Major Shareholders”) and the Major Shareholders have indicated their willingness to acquire the shares of the minority shareholders of the company who may wish to divest/sell their shares, company sources said.

Amid those developments the CSE investor sentiment indicated a significant improvement.
