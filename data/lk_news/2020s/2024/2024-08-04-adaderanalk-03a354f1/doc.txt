Bangladesh declares three-day general holiday amid ongoing unrest

The government has declared a three-day general holiday starting Monday as unrest continues to rock Bangladesh.

The general holiday comes amid the imposition of an indefinite curfew.

The holiday will last from Monday to Wednesday, and the authorities will make further decisions based on the evolving situation, Shibli Sadiq, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Public Administration, said on Sunday.

The first day of the nationwide non-cooperation movement, called by the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement demanding the government’s resignation, has triggered deadly violence in various parts of the country.

In light of the clashes and fatalities, the government announced a curfew from 6pm on Sunday.

“A night curfew has been enforced in all divisional city areas, city corporations, municipalities, industrial areas, district Sadar areas, and Upazila Sadar areas from 6pm on Sunday,” Md Sharif Mahmud Apu, senior information officer at the Ministry of Home Affairs, said in a statement on Sunday.
