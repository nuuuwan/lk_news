Self-proclaimed ‘Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva’ granted bail, referred to psychiatric treatment

Mahinda Kodituwakku, the self-proclaimed ‘Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva’ has been granted bail on the orders of Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court.

When the case was called today, Magistrate Thilina Gamage ordered the release of Kodituwakku on two personal bails of Rs. 1 million each, as he suffers from a mental disorder.

Accordingly, the accused was instructed to attend the psychiatric clinic at the National Institute of Mental Health in Mulleriyawa, every Monday.

Kodituwakku was arrested by the CID on Jan.15, on charges of committing irreligious activities that are contrary to Buddhist teachings and put behind bars on remand until today (Feb.07).

During previous court proceedings, the forensic psychiatrist told the magistrate that the suspect required psychiatric treatment.

Earlier this month, the president of Buddhist Information Centre, Ven. Agulugalle Sri Jinananda Thero had filed a complaint with the CID alleging that Kodituwakku has been misleading the Buddhist community.

Alleging that Kodituwakku has been misleading the Buddhist community, Jinananda Thero claimed that he was directly involved with the recently deceased preacher named Ruwan Prasanna Gunaratna, who had promoted ‘mass suicide’ through his distorted teachings and later died by suicide.

Meanwhile, Ven. Balangoda Kassapa Thero, addressing a media briefing, had claimed that this self-proclaimed ‘Bodhisattva’ had sexually abused his own daughter before leaving his house while calling it ‘Abinishkramanaya’ (Great Departure).
