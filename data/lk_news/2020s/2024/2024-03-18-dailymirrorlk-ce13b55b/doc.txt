Eran Wickramaratne resigns from COPE

Colombo, March 18 (Daily Mirror)- Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Eran Wickramaratne has resigned from the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) protesting against the appointment of ineligible members to the committee.

“It is dissatisfying that members who have been appointed to COPE have allegations against their personal conduct, particularly on financial transactions. This also contributes to citizen’s loss of confidence in Parliament,” he said in his letter of resignation which was sent to Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana.
