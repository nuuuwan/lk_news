CID arrests Aura Lanka Chairman

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) yesterday arrested Aura Lanka Group of Companies Chairman Viranjith Thambugala over allegations of financial fraud.

He was remanded in custody till 27 May after appearing before the Colombo Magistrate’s Court yesterday.

Thambugala’s business ventures have been under the scrutiny of authorities, while he was also cleared of charges related to an unauthorised entry into the Anuradhapura prison.

The Illicit Asset Investigation Division of the CID initiated the investigation on the Inspector General of Police’s (IGP) directives.

Thambugala was recently involved in controversy after a flurry of social media accusations surrounding an aloe vera plantation business, alleging that he was involved in unlawful activities through the initiative.

In this context, the IGP’s directives to initiate an investigation into his enterprises and the way in which his assets were acquired are relevant.
