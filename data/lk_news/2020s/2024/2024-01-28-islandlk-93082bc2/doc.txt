WHAT THE MAJORITY NEEDS AFTER THE NEXT ELECTION

The majority of the Sri Lankan population is fed up with the system of government that has been thrust upon them since 1978. The Executive Presidency, which JRJ thought would be a boon to this country has become a bane. And now his nephew has taken it a few steps further, trying to legalize various ways of curbing the freedom of the individual by trying to introduce new draconian laws.

The new president and the government should be elected with a view to a change in the system which would be of benefit to the people rather than the rulers. The first thing we need is the abolition of the Executive Presidency and reverting to the earlier system with a Prime Minister as the Executive Head and a Cabinet of Ministers not exceeding 18. The Prime Minister will be primus inter pares, the first among equals. The Parliament and the people should be vested with the sovereignty. This is the system we had up to 1978. Then came the change with His Excellency (uthumaanan) on the scene with people resenting the system change. The first assassination attempt on HE was in Parliament itself. JRJ escaped unhurt but Kamburupitiya MP Keerthi Abeywickrema was killed and Minister Lalith Athukathmudali seriously hurt.

Once the Executive Presidency is discarded, hopefully presidential pardons such as those currently under critical discussion now would cease. This power has been misused by almost all presidents pardoning well-known convicted criminals and murderers.

There are a few things that the party that wins the election should do. As indicated above, the first and the most important thing is to get rid of this bahubootha constitution (as CBK memorably called it), won the election and went back on her word of abolishing it.

Along with this change, the next thing that has to be done is to get back to the old system of first past the post and have MPs responsible to constituents of individual electorates rather than by district election on a proportional representation (PR) basis.

There is much unnecessary expenditure that should be done away with. The MPst should not be paid a salary. They should be paid a fairly substantive allowance for attending Parliamentary sessions so that it would ensure the maximum attendance at sessions. The Parliament restaurant should serve just tea and short eats rather than heavily subsidized sumptuous meals. The practice of paying pensions to Presidents, MPs and their widows should be done away with. Former Presidents (and their widows) should not be given palaces and lavish perks that are a big drain on the public purse.

In respect of the Parliament. The Speaker or any member should not be allowed to employ members of their families in various fictitious and unnecessary positions, as this leads to nepotism and in a manner, corruption.

Nominating members through the National List should be abolished as this has been misused by practically all governments to nominate their henchmen. The worst was when the National List was used to nominate candidates totally rejected by the people, which includes the incumbent president.

The Provincial Council system should also be abolished as it served no purpose except to benefit the Councilors. It was an unnecessary waste of public funds with no returns to the public. The local government authorities could certainly carry out the work related to their areas without duplication as was the case before the Provincial Councils came into being.

The next thing to be attended to is the housing of ministers, state ministers and MPs. They should be given an allowance commensurate to their positions for them to find their own accommodation. Of course, if they intend to travel from their homes they should be provided with season tickets to travel by train, which W Dahananyake did long ago. One vehicle each should provided with a single policeman as a bodyguard in the same vehicle. There should be no retinue of guards and ambulances in a convoy as at present. If anyone has fears of security, he or she should not come forward for an election.

A very important item that has to be made absolutely necessary is that every candidate coming forward for election has to declare his/her assets and liabilities. Failure to do should result in the cancellation of the nomination of such a person. After the election, at the end of every year a fresh declaration should be obtained.

The system of having Advisors to the president, prime minister and ministries should also be done away with. The president or a minister presumably accepts the post knowing what needs to be done. If those who aspire to such positions feel that he/she might not be able to handle things without the advice, sometimes of incompetents, he/she should not accept the position.

No MP should be allowed to retain his/her seat if found guilty of fraud, corruption or smuggling etc. Remember the recent case with culprit retaining his [arliamentary seat. of Parliament.

Central Bank Governors should be entitled to a pension only if they have served 10 years or more. Those who have not completed 10 years of service should be paid some sort of gratuity commensurate with their years of service.

The government should concentrate on developing agriculture as Sri Lanka has always been an agricultural nation. If industries are developed, they should be based on agriculture, with a view to export. To ease the export of local products all red tape should be done away with, and the bureaucrats should help those who intend exporting products to enhance foreign exchange instead of throwing various obstacles in the way.

The government should encourage farmers to grow all kinds of fruits to export fresh as well as canned fruit. With the availability of so many varieties of mangoes and bananas, it will be a real money spinner. The treacle and other related products from the kitul and coconut palms could also bring in good foreign exchange. Sri Lanka can concentrate more on the export of fresh vegetables.

With the sea right round the island if fisheries are developed Sri Lanka can export prawns, shrimps, and fresh fish to make maximum use of the wealth we have most of which is being illegally taken away from our fishermen by Indian poachers.
