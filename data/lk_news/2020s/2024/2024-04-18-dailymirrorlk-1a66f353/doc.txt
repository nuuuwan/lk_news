Retired Major arrested for fraud in Russian army job scheme

Colombo, April 18 (Daily Mirror) - The Criminal Investigations Department (CID) arrested two suspects, including a retired Major of the Sri Lanka Army for fraudulently obtaining money from individuals promising employment in the Russian army.

The arrest came in the wake of reports on rackets involving the trafficking of Sri Lankans for military service in Russia, all without government oversight or intervention.

Earlier, it was reported that 17 Sri Lankans had returned home after fleeing military camps in Russia. It was reported that several other Sri Lankans still remain trapped in similar military camps, unable to return to the country.

In March, Al Jazeera reported that hundreds of Sri Lankans are serving with the Russian military in Ukraine, with casualties among them. Many were enticed by lucrative salaries and the prospect of Russian citizenship.

State Minister of Defence Pramitha Bandara Tennakoon earlier said that no Sri Lankans were sent with government approval to join in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. He said that all members of the Sri Lankan tri-forces have been informed not to join Russian or Ukrainian forces through any illegal means.

Meanwhile, amidst reports that some ex-military men from Sri Lanka have joined the Russian military operations against Ukraine, Sri Lankaâ€™s Ambassador to Russia, Prof. Janitha Liyanage said she has requested a meeting with Russian defence authorities to seek information on whether there are any former members of the Sri Lankan military involved in military operations carried out by Russia against Ukraine.

Prof. Liyanage said that ex-servicemen from Sri Lanka are joining the Russian Army through private agencies, expecting higher salaries.

She said that the embassy does not have any information about them due to their arrivals being organized on a personal level.
