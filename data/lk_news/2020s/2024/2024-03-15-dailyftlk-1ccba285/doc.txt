Keheliya submits bail application to High Court

Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, who is in remand custody in connection with the substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) procurement, has submitted a bail application to the Colombo High Court.

The new development comes after the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court rejected bail for Rambukwella, and six other accused in the case on Thursday.

In his bail application filed through his legal counsels, Rambukwella claimed that the Maligakanda Magistrate’s decision to reject bail for him is unlawful. He also sought the High Court to release him on bail subjected to any condition.

On Thursday, Maligakanda Magistrate Lochani Abeywickrama overruled the accused’ bail pleas and detained them indefinitely under the provisions of the Public Property Act and fixed the case to be recalled on 28 March.
