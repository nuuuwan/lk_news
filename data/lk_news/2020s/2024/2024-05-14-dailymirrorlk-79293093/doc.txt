Return to work prioritising welfare of students: UGC Chairman

All non-academic employees are requested to return to work, prioritising the welfare of the students, University Grants Commission (UGC) Chairman Sampath Amaratunge said.

Addressing the media today, he said that due to the ongoing trade union strike by non-academic employees, the country's university system is facing a significant crisis.

Due to the ongoing non-academic employee strike, most of the lecturers conduct lectures through online platforms. About 3,500 resident students of the Rajarata University have left their hostels.

"The children who faced a lot of trouble during the Covid-19 pandemic had sat for the Advanced Level examination scheduled for 2022 in 2023 and studied in the first year of the universities. The 2023 examination will be held this year, and the results will be released this month," Professor Amarathunga said.

He said due to the strike the delay in the preparation of the student handbook for university entrance will delay the admission of students to the university.

There is a risk that both groups will be stuck in the first year if the university entrance is delayed due to the strike, the professor said.
