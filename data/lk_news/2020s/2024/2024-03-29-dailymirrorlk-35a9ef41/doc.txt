Do not click on links shared on social media platforms: SLCERT

Colombo, March 28 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (SLCERT) requested people not to click on links shared on social media platforms claiming to receive presents given by popular brand names and their trade marks.

SLCERT Senior Information Security Engineer Charuka Damunupola said those links may be received via SMS, WhatsApp, X formerly known as Twitter, Facebook now known as Meta and as a call received on their mobile phone.

Damunupola requests the public to first confirm the authenticity of the requests before responding to them. These kinds of links can be received through your friend groups, he said.

The SLCERT investigations revealed that clicking on certain social media links can lead to privacy breaches.

Clicking on those fraudulent links will lead to breaching of personnel details such as your National Identity Card (NIC), driving licence, bank account details, One Time Password (OTP), workplace details.

Sometimes the links can be downloaded and install third-party mobile applications, to steal personnel details stored on mobile phones.

They also requested not to share those links with others, as they may also become victims.
