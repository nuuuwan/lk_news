UNFPA Asia Pacific Regional Director arrives in Sri Lanka

Feb 28 - The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Sri Lanka welcomed Pio Smith, the UNFPA Asia Pacific Regional Director, who arrived in the country for a formal visit.

Mr. Smith's visit aims to bolster collaboration with policymakers, government officials, civil society, and key partners to advocate for the rights of women and girls. During his stay, he will also visit grassroots communities to assess their needs firsthand and identify areas for effective UNFPA support.

UNFPA Sri Lanka underscores its enduring collaboration with the Government of Sri Lanka and diverse stakeholders island-wide, driving progress in health, education, and gender equality. The organization champions comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services, aligning with commitments to the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) agenda.

Since the historic ICPD conference in 1994, Sri Lanka has adopted a comprehensive approach to reproductive health and family planning, ensuring accessible information and services for informed decision-making. UNFPA Sri Lanka, with support from donors and partners, has initiated mobile health clinics and delivers maternity and dignity kits to pregnant women and girls in crisis situations.

Gender-based violence (GBV) remains a key concern addressed by UNFPA Sri Lanka through One Stop Centres offering comprehensive services for survivors, including reproductive and maternal health, psychosocial support, and legal assistance. The organization supports Emergency Waiting Areas at police stations across the country to ensure safety for women and girls facing GBV.

Moreover, UNFPA Sri Lanka collaborates closely with the Department of Census and Statistics to foster data-driven decision-making for resource allocation to reach marginalized populations. As Sri Lanka navigates challenging times, UNFPA remains committed to fostering inclusive communities and supporting the country's economic recovery efforts.

UNFPA Sri Lanka anticipates Mr. Pio Smith's visit will further strengthen collaboration and support for the people of Sri Lanka as they collectively strive towards a progressive tomorrow.
