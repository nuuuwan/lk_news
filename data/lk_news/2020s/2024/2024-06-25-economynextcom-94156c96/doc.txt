Sri Lanka to digitize monks’ education through piriven

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will digitalize education in priven, or schools for monks, cabinet spokesman minister Bandula Gunawardena said.

“The president is committed to digitalizing classrooms,” Gunawardena told reporters on Tuesday. “The same should apply for piriven.”

“We have 825 piriven in this country with over 100,000 students,” Gunawardena said.

These monastic colleges will be provided computers, smart boards and printers.

Sri Lanka is in the process of digitizing its classrooms with funding from the Chinese Government. (Colombo/Jun25/2024)
