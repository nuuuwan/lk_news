Executive Presidency will be abolished under NPP government: Tilvin

Colombo, Feb. 29 (Daily Mirror)- Steps will be taken to abolish the Executive Presidency under a National People's Power (NPP) government after introducing a new Constitution, NPP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said.

He told a news conference that the government has started a fresh slogan claiming to abolish the Executive Presidency after they have realised that they cannot win at the next Presidential election.

"They did not want to abolish the Executive Presidency when there was a huge people's protest against the government. They are now claiming to do it as they have realised that they cannot win at the next Presidential election. We have continuously struggled to abolish the Executive Presidency. They are the ones who misled the people by giving false promises to abolish it," he said.

He said only the NPP can abolish the Executive Presidency and ensure the people's sovereignty.

"We will take steps to abolish the Executive Presidency through a new Constitution after winning the Presidential election and forming a strong government," he said.
