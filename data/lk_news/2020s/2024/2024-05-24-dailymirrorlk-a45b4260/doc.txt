Health officials raise alarm over hygiene standards at Dansals

Colombo, May 24 (Daily Mirror) -  As relentless rainfall continues, health authorities are sounding the alarm on hygiene standards at dansals during the Vesak festival.

A senior official from the Health Ministry disclosed to the Daily Mirror that they have instructed local Medical Officers of Health and Public Health Inspectors to intensify monitoring of hygiene practices at dansals.

Furthermore, health authorities have issued a public notice urging immediate reporting to the nearest Medical Officer of Health or Public Health Inspector if any food served at dansals is deemed unsafe or unfit for consumption.

Despite regular inspections conducted by Public Health Inspectors (PHIs) during the Vesak festival, Head of the PHI Union Upul Rohan told Daily Mirror that certain dansals have failed to meet the required hygiene standards.

“We will take necessary action against operators of the such dansals,” he stressed.

Meanwhile, the Public Health Inspectors Union noted a decrease in the number of dansals this year due to adverse weather conditions.
