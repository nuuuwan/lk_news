Sri Lanka slated to achieve 3 percent economic growth this year: President

Parliament, May 09 (Daily Mirror)- Sri Lanka is slated to achieve a three percent economic growth while inflation has dropped to 1.5 percent by going along on a challenging and correct path, President Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament today.

“The Rupee has been stabilized against the dollar and stands at less than Rs. 300,” he said, making a review of the economy in Parliament.

The President said the debt restructuring process is expected to be completed by the middle of this year.

“The ultimate goal of the restructuring process is to push total debt services down to 95 percent of the GDP and to bring the foreign debt service to 4.5 percent,” he said.

In a special statement in Parliament, the President said he assumed leadership of the country without any conditions, despite being a sole member of Parliament and cited his well-thought-out plan, extensive experience and international relations as the reasons for his confidence in the country's recovery from its challenges.
