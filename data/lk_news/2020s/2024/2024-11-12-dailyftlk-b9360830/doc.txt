Rohitha Abeygunawardena gets emotional on stage, says ready to serve as Opposition MP

The New Democratic Front (NDF) Kalutara district candidate Rohitha Abeygunawardena became emotional during a rally recently, as he addressed the crowd in preparation for the upcoming General Election.

He was seen struggling to hold back tears and shakily stated, “I have always stood by the people.” During his address, Abeygunawardena declared his willingness to serve as an Opposition MP, indicating the determination to continue his political journey, regardless of position.

“We are going to do what the Opposition is supposed to do. We are not going to topple the Government. But we urge President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to deliver on those Presidential Election promises without further delaying,” he added.

Abeygunawardena said if the Government manages to deliver on those promises, he would not shy away from acknowledging the integrity of the Government, whilst noting that if it be unsuccessful he will raise his voice at the Parliament stating that the administration failed.
