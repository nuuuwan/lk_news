Two bills to empower women during economic recovery

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s government will present two bills to Parliament to empower women during the initial phase of economic recovery, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said.

Women face challenges in safeguarding their families amidst the economic crisis, Wickremesinghe said. “I witnessed first-hand the dire plight of women, many heading households amidst scarcity.”

Wickremesinghe was speaking at the unveiling of three “Anti-Violence Global Gestures” handprints against sexual violence targeting women and girls in public spaces, organized by Dhammika Perera’s DP Education at the Nelum Pokuna Theater in Colombo on Friday.

“This endeavour holds promise in empowering women against the scourge of violence they face, particularly exacerbated by economic crises,” Wickremesinghe said. “Legislation against such violence is being introduced in parliament.”

The Women’s Empowerment Bill and the Gender Equality Bill will enact a national policy on gender parity and women’s empowerment, he said. Both bills are slated for passage in June.

“Mr Dhammika Perera has initiated a transformative movement,” Wickremesinghe said. “While addressing violence against women, today’s event introduced techniques for prevention.

“I anticipate significant publicity for this initiative, given the presence of both capitalists and philanthropists in our nation. Philanthropists, individuals who amass wealth and engage in social endeavours, exemplify this spirit. Mr. Dhammika Perera stands as a prime example through his altruistic actions.”

There are also discussions “to augment female representation in local government elections following the presidential and general elections. It is our aspiration to ensure at least a 25% representation of women in parliamentary seats and to bolster their presence in provincial councils.” (Colombo/May11/2024)
