Inland Revenue Department’s IT Strategic Plan 2025-2027 gets Cabinet nod

The Cabinet of Ministers at their meeting on Monday approved the Inland Revenue Department’s (IRD) Information Technology Strategic Plan for the period 2025-2027, a critical component of the ongoing digitalisation efforts.

“The preparation of the IT Strategic Plan was mandated as a structural measure under the comprehensive loan facility program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and it is expected to significantly enhance the IRD’s efficiency through digital transformation,” Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said.

Speaking at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting yesterday, he said the plan was approved before the IMF deadline of August 2024.

The IT Strategic Plan aims to streamline operations, improve tax collection, and reduce administrative burdens by leveraging advanced technology, aligning with the Government’s broader goals of fiscal stabilisation and transparency.

He said this move is seen as a critical step in modernising the IRD’s infrastructure and enhancing service delivery, paving the way for improved tax administration in the country.

The proposal to this effect presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as the Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies Minister was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
