Two arrested for defrauding money promising employment in Canada

Two individuals have been apprehended by the Special Investigation Unit of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) in connection with a foreign employment scam.

The arrests were made following a raid on an institution located in Borella, prompted by a complaint alleging that the company had defrauded Rs. 1 million from individuals promising employment opportunities in the financial sector in Canada.

Investigations have revealed that the institution was operating as an unlicensed foreign employment agency, without the necessary authorization from the SLBFE.

The Special Investigation Unit of the SLBFE has arrested the owner of the company along with another suspect. After being produced before the court, the suspects have been released on two surety bails of Rs. 1 million each.
