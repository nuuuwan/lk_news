NH Collection brand enters Sri Lanka replacing Mövenpick at Softlogic hotel

ECONOMYNEXT – Softlogic Holdings said its Colombo city hotel will be operated by Thailand-based Minor leisure group under its upmarket NH Collection brand from June 1.

“The debut of the NH Collection Hotels & Resorts brand in Sri Lanka is an indication of the untapped potential and opportunity for tourism in Sri Lanka, particularly in the city of Colombo,” Softlogic said in a stock exchange filing.

The hotel has 219 rooms and has so far been operated by Movenpick, hotels and resorts.

Minor Hotels has three other properties in Sri Lanka – Anantara Kalutara Resort, Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle Resort and Avani Kalutara Resort.

The Softlogic hotel property, which consists of 219 rooms and suites providing an expansive view of the Indian ocean and Colombo city, will be branded as the “NH Collection Colombo Hotel”.

Minor Hotels has over 550 hotels and resorts and serves customers in 56 countries, the statement said. (Colombo/May31/2024)
