Fuel prices likely to reduce tonight?

A revision of fuel prices is likely to take effect from midnight today (04) based on the fuel pricing formula.

The Ministry of Power and Energy stated that the fuel prices could possibly be reduced during this price revision.

The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) amends the fuel prices monthly as per the pricing formula.

The fuel price revision for the month of March took place on March 04, where the price of Petrol 95 Octane was reduced by Rs. 09, while Super Diesel was reduced by Rs. 10. Meanwhile the price of Kerosene was also reduced by Rs. 05 per litre.

It is predicted that the price of fuel will likely be reduced during this price revision in consideration to the rupeeâ€™s continuous appreciation against the US dollar and the price of crude oil dropping in the global market.
