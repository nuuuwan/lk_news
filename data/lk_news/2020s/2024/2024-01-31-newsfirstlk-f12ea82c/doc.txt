Keheliya Faces Bribery Charges Over Alleged Public Fund Misuse

COLOMBO (News 1st); The Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court heard the case against Keheliya Rambukwella, filed by the Bribery Commission.

The charges stem from an alleged incident during his tenure as Minister of Media, where State Printing Corporation funds were reportedly used to settle his personal telephone bill.

Rambukwella's defense presented initial objections to the indictment, and Colombo Chief High Court Judge, Damith Thotawatta, postponed issuing an order on these objections until February 16th.

Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and former State Printing Corporation Chairman Jayampathi Bandara Heinkenda have been charged by the Bribery Commission under the Bribery Act, over the alleged misuse of public funds.
