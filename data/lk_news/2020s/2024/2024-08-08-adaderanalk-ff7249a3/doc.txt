Circular issued for monthly allowance for pensioners

Despite the Election Commissionâ€™s directive to halt the Rs.3,000 allowance for pensioners during the election period, the Secretary of the Ministry of Public Administration has issued a circular regarding its distribution.

Reportedly, circulars were issued yesterday (7) to Ministry Secretaries, Heads of Departments, District Secretaries, and Divisional Secretaries, informing them that the allowance payment would commence effective from September.

The Election Commission had recently instructed the Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils, and Local Government to suspend the said allowance until the presidential election concludes.

This was discussed during a meeting with ministry secretaries at the Election Commission.

However, the Election Commission says that issuing a circular to provide the relevant allowance while ignoring the order is against the election law.
