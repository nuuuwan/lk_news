An early General Election will create political unrest: Ruwan

Colombo, March 30 (Daily Mirror) - An early General Election will create political unrest as the ultimate result of it would be a hung Parliament, UNP Deputy Leader Ruwan Wijewardene said yesterday.

Mr. Wijewardene came up with this remark when speaking to journalists after meeting the Mahanayaka Theras of Asgiriya and Malwatta chapters in Kandy.

“No party will get a majority in Parliament at a General Election and this will result in a political crisis.there would be a turnaround of the stability in Sri Lanka that the government has managed to earn, in the event of an early General Election,” Mr. Wijewardene said.

Mr. Wijewardene also stated that some in the SLPP and even in opposition parties including SJB favour an early General Election. President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s idea is to hold a Presidential Election first in accordance with the constitution.

“We are confident that a majority of SLPP and SJB will support Mr. Wickremesinghe if he contests as a common candidate,” he added. Further, he said neither the SJB nor the National People’s Power (NPP) is a challenge to the UNP.
