The company responsible for collecting money through an automated system for parking vehicles within the Colombo city has reportedly failed to pay Rs. 90 million owed to the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC).

The CMC Deputy Director (Traffic and Road Design) Eng. Manjula Kularathna, stated that due to this non-payment, the contract has been suspended and legal measures are being taken.

He also mentioned that due to the shortcomings of the current project, a new electronic system is expected to be introduced within the next year.
