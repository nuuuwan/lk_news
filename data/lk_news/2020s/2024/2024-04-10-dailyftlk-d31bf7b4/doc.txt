Cabinet approves recruitment of 2,500 English teachers

To strengthen language proficiency countrywide, the Cabinet of Ministers approved recruiting 2,500 English teachers.

“The Government has recognised the pressing need for English teachers, particularly in schools offering General Certificate of Education (GCE) Ordinary Level subjects in English. Currently, 4,441 English teachers have been approved for these schools, leaving a deficit of 6,500 teachers to meet the demand,” Cabinet Co-Spokesperson and Minister Bandula Gunawardena disclosed.

Highlighting the importance of English proficiency in today’s globalised world, Gunawardena asserted the Government’s determination to expand English medium education across the country.

“At present, 765 schools are teaching in the English medium, and the Government aims to increase this number to 1,000 by the end of the year. Thus, the approval to recruit 2,500 English teachers is a significant step towards achieving this goal, ensuring that students have access to quality English language instruction regardless of their geographical location or socioeconomic background,” he explained.

However, he said their salaries will still be as per the normal scale despite the multi-fold increase salaries in the private schools.

“The recruitment drive not only addresses the immediate shortage of English teachers but also lays the groundwork for a more robust and inclusive education system,” he said.
