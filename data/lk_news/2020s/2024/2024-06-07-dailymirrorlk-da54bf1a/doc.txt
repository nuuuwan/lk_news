Authorities to pursue extradition of Jayamaha

Colombo, June 7 (Daily Mirror) Following the Supreme Court's ruling declaring former President Maithripala Sirisena's pardon of Don Shamantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha as arbitrary and invalid, Sri Lankan authorities have intensified efforts to bring the convicted murderer back to the country, suspected to be in Singapore.

However, Sri Lankaâ€™s efforts are likely to hit a snag in this regard because no extradition treaty has been signed yet with Singapore.

Such an agreement can be signed only with the concurrence of the two countries. Sri Lanka has signed such agreements with numerous other countries.

According to police sources, Jayamaha, who had been serving a prison sentence for the Royal Park murder case, left Sri Lanka on November 15, 2019, just days before an interim order was issued prohibiting him from leaving the country.

It was revealed that Jayamaha had obtained a passport on November 13, 2019 immediately after receiving the presidential pardon.

It was reported that Jayamaha is currently residing overseas, suspected to be in Singapore, and authorities are seeking international assistance for his extradition."

"Since he officially left the country, after the pardon, the police can only request authorities in certain countries that he is now a wanted prisoner and request to deport him to the country," Police Spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa said.
