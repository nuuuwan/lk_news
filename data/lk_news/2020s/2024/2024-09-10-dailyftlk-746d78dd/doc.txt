The highly anticipated grand finale of the 2024 edition of the SPARK Skilled Youth Entrepreneurship Competition was celebrated on 5 September. This national platform for Sri Lanka’s next generation of entrepreneurs empowered five finalists from both the “school” and “open” categories to showcase their innovative business ideas. The event culminated in the crowning of this year’s winners.

The annual SPARK Skilled Youth Entrepreneurship Competition is organised by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce with support from The International Labour Organisation (ILO), South Asia Leadership in Entrepreneurship (SALE) project, and funded by the US Department of State.

In the School Category, W. Lasindu Buddhika from Siripura Central College claimed the top spot with his promising venture “Dum Malu Bite”. In the Open Category, Dr. Merengnage Romela Merise Salgado emerged victorious with the startup “Pet Labs”. Both winners were celebrated for their innovative ideas and entrepreneurial efforts, marking a successful outcome for this year’s competition.

During the competition’s first round, 100 contestants were selected from a diverse pool of applicants across the two categories. The selected participants navigated a rigorous skill development process including virtual training, residential bootcamp, one-on-one mentoring and business pitching sessions.

The business pitches by the top six finalists were a highlight of the event, with each contestant introducing their ideas to a panel of judges. The judges then announced the winners, awarding trophies and certificates to the winners and runners-up.

Education Ministry Secretary Thilaka Jayasundara emphasised the role of such competitions in nurturing innovation and entrepreneurship among students saying, “The SPARK competition is not just about celebrating winners; it’s about nurturing an entrepreneurial mindset among all participants. It’s a platform for cultivating skills, confidence, and resilience to turn innovative ideas into reality. This year’s diverse range of entries – from tech solutions to eco-friendly products – showcases the boundless creativity and potential of our youth. They need encouragement, guidance, and support to transform these ideas into tangible businesses that can address global challenges and ensure their engagement in decent and productive work.”

The finale event brought together key stakeholders including government officials, international organisations, young entrepreneurs, educators, industry and business leaders to celebrate the achievements of these young innovators and celebrate the spirit of entrepreneurship among Sri Lanka’s youth. The SPARK finale also recognised the contributions of partners, sponsors, judges, mentors, and trainers, for their support and guidance throughout the competition.

Commenting on the finale, Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Chairman Duminda Hulangamuwa stated, “The SPARK 2024 Competition finale was a powerful demonstration of the incredible talent and potential of young Sri Lankan entrepreneurs. The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce is proud to have facilitated the SPARK platform to showcase their ideas and skills. My congratulations to the winners. The passion and innovation displayed by all the finalists were promising, and I am confident that they will go on to reach greater heights in their entrepreneurship journey. We are committed to continuing to support and empower young entrepreneurs, who are the future of the country’s economy.”

In addition to the main entrepreneurship competition, for the first time SPARK 2024 also recognised young journalism talents with awards for the SPARK Young Entrepreneurship Journalist and SPARK Young Entrepreneurial Journalist.

International Labour Organisation Country Office – Sri Lanka and Maldives Director Joni Simpson said, “The SPARK competition is a platform for young entrepreneurs to tackle the Triple Transitions: digitalisation, demographic shifts, and climate change. It encourages participants to develop and validate innovative ideas, turning them into viable business models. Contestants receive continuous technical support and the opportunity to expand their knowledge and networks. We encourage all Sri Lankan youth, especially young women, to join the SPARK Competition 2025 and boost women’s entrepreneurship. The International Labour Organisation is proud to support this initiative and wishes all contestants success in their entrepreneurial journey.”

The SPARK 2024 competition, with its focus on youth entrepreneurship, has once again proven to be a platform for innovation and creativity, providing young entrepreneurs with the opportunity to shine and contribute to the economic development of Sri Lanka.
