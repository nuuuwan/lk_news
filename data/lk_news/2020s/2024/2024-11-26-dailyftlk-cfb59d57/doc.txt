Cargills Bank, established in 2014, has quickly made a name for itself in Sri Lanka’s banking sector with a focus on innovation and customer excellence. To improve access to financial services, Cargills Bank has teamed up with Sampath IT Solutions Ltd. (SITS) to manage its network of Point-of-Sale (POS) systems across the country.

This partnership is a major step for Cargills Bank, allowing it to concentrate on providing great customer experiences while SITS handles the technical and operational tasks of maintaining POS systems. With SITS expertise in financial technology, Cargills Bank can now offer quicker and more reliable services nationwide.

“Partnering with SITS allows us to continue evolving our technology infrastructure while providing top-tier support to our clients across the country,” said Cargills Bank (PLC) Head of Card Services Kaushi Fernando. “We are excited about the future developments in the fintech space that this collaboration will bring.”

A key part of this collaboration is the use of advanced technology. SITS will implement data encryption, real-time monitoring, and automated maintenance for POS systems. This means Cargills Bank customers can easily make payments or check their balances, all while feeling secure about their transactions.

The partnership also aims to enhance the customer experience. With faster transaction times and better integration with mobile payment systems, customers can expect shorter waits when shopping at a store. This collaboration is significant for both companies. For Cargills Bank, it strengthens their ability to provide 24/7 services across Sri Lanka, even in remote areas where banking has been challenging historically. For SITS, it showcases their skills in managing large-scale banking operations, reinforcing their reputation as a leader in fintech in the region.

Looking ahead, both companies plan to continue innovating to meet the evolving demands of modern banking. Future initiatives may include AI-powered customer support and more efficient banking operations, all aimed at setting new benchmarks for financial services in Sri Lanka.

“We are honoured to partner with Cargills Bank, a company that shares our focus on innovation and ethical practices,” said Assistant Vice President Sameera Priyadarshana. “This partnership will help us offer secure and tech-savvy solutions that enhance the banking experience for Sri Lankans.”
