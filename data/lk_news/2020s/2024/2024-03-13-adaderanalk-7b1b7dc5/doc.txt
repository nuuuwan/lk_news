Immunoglobulin scandal: Medical Supplies Division’s Deputy Director arrested at BIA

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has arrested Dr. Thusitha Sudarshana, the Deputy Director of the Health Ministry’s Medical Supplies Division on arrival in Sri Lanka at the Bandaranaike International Airport in Katunayake.

Police Media Spokesman DIG Nihala Thalduwa said the arrest was carried out in connection with the import of substandard Human Immunoglobulin vials.

Eight individuals including former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, former Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Chandragupta and Additional Secretary of the Health Ministry Dr. Saman Ratnayake currently remain under remand custody in connection with the case.

Meanwhile on March 06, Dr. Ratnayake made a 4-hour-long confidential statement to the Maligakanda Magistrate regarding the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).

In October 2023, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests.

The product, which was said to have been manufactured by Livealth Biopharma Pvt Ltd. India, was imported by a local medicine supplier called Isolez Biotech Pharma AG (Pvt) Ltd. However, the India-based manufacturer has denied having a hand in this fraudulent activity and communicated to the NMRA that it has neither manufactured, supplied nor exported these products to any party.

Reportedly, funds amounting to Rs. 144 million have been misappropriated through the unlawful procurement of 22,500 vials of IVIG.
