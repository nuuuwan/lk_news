NPP not expecting to legalize prostitution: Harini

Colombo, Jan 19 (Daily Mirror) -  The National People's Power (NPP) was not expecting to legalize prostitution and that it would only amend some laws which inconvenience those who were forced to prostitution due to economic hardships, NPP MP Harini Amarasuriya said today.

She told the Daily Mirror that the main focus of the NPP was to revive the economy of the country as  economic hardships had forced women into prostitution.

The MP said women who were forced to prostitution had to face numerous hardships due to some laws and that the NPP would amend such laws to minimize such situations and to protect the rights of the women.

She said sex workers who were subjected to exploitation were further harassed due to some laws.

Referring to media reports on a claim made by NPP member Samanmalee Gunasinghe over legalizing prostitution, Amarasuriya said legalizing prostitution is only a popular topic and that media had only highlighted a part of her speech adding that her complete comment carries the correct idea.
