Hayleys Fabric PLC, a leading textile manufacturer in Sri Lanka, has received the Gold award in the Textile and Textile Processing Industry at the Presidential Environmental Awards 2024. This prestigious accolade highlights Hayleys Fabric’s unwavering commitment to environmental sustainability, distinguishing the business among nearly 1000 applicants nationwide. The award’s selection process emphasised companies’ environmental dedication, with Hayleys Fabric standing out for its robust ESG (Environment, Social, and Governance) framework.

“We are deeply honoured to receive this recognition. It reaffirms our dedication to sustainable practices and motivates us to continue leading by example. At Hayleys Fabric, we believe that true sustainability is about proving our commitment through tangible actions and results,” said Hayleys Fabric PLC Managing Director/CEO Rohan Goonetilleke.

Hayleys Fabric PLC leads in sustainable practices, being the first Sri Lankan company to commit to the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Validated in August 2023, their targets aim to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 42% and Scope 3 emissions by 25% by 2030, with a long-term goal of achieving Net Zero by 2050. The company also holds the distinction of being the first fabric mill in Sri Lanka to acquire ISO 50001 certification for energy management, with 75% of its energy usage sourced from renewables. Their operation of the largest single rooftop solar installation in Sri Lanka, contributing 4.6MW to the national grid, underscores their leadership in promoting sustainable energy practices.

Hayleys Fabric excels in water conservation, as a signatory to the CEO Water Mandate since 2020. The company maintains onsite raw water and wastewater treatment plants, ensuring compliance with local and global water discharge regulations. Through process improvements, a 17% reduction in water intensity was achieved last year. Both annual water and carbon footprints are verified by a third party, ensuring transparency and accountability.

Hayleys Fabric ensures sustainable sourcing through stringent environmental and social compliance screening for raw material suppliers. This rigorous selection process earned them the Eco Label Certificate from the governing Council of Eco Label Sri Lanka, signifying their products meet high environmental standards throughout their lifecycle. By prioritising sustainability in its supply chain, Hayleys Fabric reduces its environmental impact and encourages responsible practices among suppliers.

The company has implemented a comprehensive waste management strategy addressing both hazardous and non-hazardous waste. Hazardous waste is incinerated, while non-hazardous waste is managed through a waste hierarchy prioritising reduction, reuse, and recycling. An innovative waste upcycling project with the Pro Green Lab of the University of Moratuwa transforms in-house waste into eco-friendly construction materials, contributing to the circular economy.

Hayleys Fabric maintains the Diyathuru Uyana biodiversity wetland park along the Kalu River, home to 146 plant species and 149 animal species, including several endemic to Sri Lanka. The park, identified by the Environment Ministry as critical for biodiversity conservation, reflects the company’s commitment to preserving biodiversity. Additionally, Hayleys Fabric is involved in a restoration project for the endangered Lagenandra kalugalensis, collaborating with the Central Environment Authority and local universities.

The company has launched several successful sustainable innovations, including WARNA by Mahogany, a natural dye made from furniture industry waste. This project won the Bronze Award for Best Environmental Friendly Innovation in the Open Category at the Presidential Environmental Awards 2024. Such initiatives demonstrate Hayleys Fabric’s ability to turn waste into valuable resources.

Hayleys Fabric’s Eco Champions event evaluates the success of internal sustainability projects, with a carbon-neutral awards ceremony verified by Control Union Sri Lanka.

The “Nature by Hayleys Fabric” forum, the first sustainability forum in Sri Lanka’s textile sector, showcased the company’s innovative and eco-friendly textiles. Additionally, the company hosted Chemilies, an online forum aimed at raising awareness about chemical management among stakeholders.

Hayleys Fabric PLC’s Gold award at the Presidential Environmental Awards 2024 is a testament to their commitment to environmental sustainability.

Their comprehensive ESG framework, focusing on energy and emissions management, water conservation, sustainable supply chain practices, waste management, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable innovations, sets a benchmark for the textile industry. Their leadership not only reduces environmental impact but also encourages responsible practices among stakeholders, underscoring the importance of environmental stewardship in achieving long-term success.
