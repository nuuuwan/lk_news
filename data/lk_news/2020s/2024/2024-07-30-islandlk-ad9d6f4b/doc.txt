Preventing crop damage by wild animals could lead to SL’s food sufficiency – minister

Preventing crop damage caused by wild animals could ensure that the country’s harvest remains adequate for the population even without expanding on cropland, Agriculture and Plantation Industries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.

‘Currently, wild animals are responsible for more than 40 percent of crop damage in the country, resulting in losses worth billions of rupees over the years. Farmers countrywide have been urging the government to implement a permanent solution to mitigate this issue, Amaraweera explained.

The minister also said that if wild animal-induced crop damage is managed effectively, existing harvests would meet the country’s requirements without needing to increase cultivation.

The Island Financial Review learns that the Sri Lanka Hadabima Authority has launched a program offering air rifles to farmers at a 50 percent discount. The Authority will cover half the cost of each air rifle, while farmers will be responsible for the remaining 50 percent. This year the program aims to distribute 1,000 air rifles across the island.

A recent distribution event took place in Agunakolapelassa, where the minister highlighted the severe crop damage inflicted by torque monkeys, peacocks, giant squirrels, and wild boar.

The minister said that despite various strategies being adopted to prevent this damage, none has been successful. The minister also said that farmers across the country consistently request better protection for their crops.

Emphasizing the urgency of finding a sustainable solution, the Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries is developing a comprehensive plan, although details will be disclosed at a later date. The minister assured that the implementation of this plan is forthcoming.
