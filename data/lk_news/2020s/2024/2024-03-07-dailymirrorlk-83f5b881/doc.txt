Deshabandu’s appointment as IGP challenged before Supreme Court

Colombo, March 07 (Daily Mirror) -  A Fundamental Rights petition has been filed before the Supreme Court seeking an order preventing Deshabandu Tennakoon from functioning as the Inspector General of Police.

The Anti Corruption Movement affiliated to the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) filed this petition, further seeking a declaration that newly appointed IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon is unfit to hold public office including any post in the Sri Lanka Police Force.

Convener of the Anti Corruption Movement Niroshan Padukka and Committee Member Ananda Palitha filed this petition naming IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon, members of the Constitutional Council, members of the National Police Commission and the Attorney General as respondents.

The petitioners stated that the appointment of Deshabandu Tennakoon as IGP by the President on February 27 is contrary to the rule of law and violating the provisions of the Constitution.
