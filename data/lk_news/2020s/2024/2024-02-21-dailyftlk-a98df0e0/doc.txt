He underscored PCC’s significant progress in achieving key project milestones, including the marina promenade and other signature developments set to break ground in 2024 despite the past two challenging years, whilst extending support from CWEIC to position the project as a top investment destination. ‘Port City Colombo will be a winner for those who participate in it,’ were his concluding remarks.
