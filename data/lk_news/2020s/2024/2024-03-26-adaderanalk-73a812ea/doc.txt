Court dismisses preliminary objections raised in Keheliya’s misappropriation case

The Colombo High Court on Tuesday (March 26) dismissed preliminary objections raised by Keheliya Rambukwella and another accused in a misappropriation case, stating that the lawsuit filed by the Bribery Commission could not be maintained.

The duo is accused of allegedly misappropriating the funds belonging to the State Printing Corporation to pay Rambukwella’s personal telephone bill amounting to Rs. 230,000 between March and April 2012, during his tenure as the Mass Media Minister.

When the case was called before Colombo High Court, the defense attorney argued that the case could not be maintained, however, Judge Damith Thotawatta granted leave to proceed with the case filed against Rambukwella and former chairman of the corporation Jayampathi Bandara Heenkenda.

Rambukwella, who is currently in remand custody in connection with this alleged implication in the procurement of substandard human immunoglobulin vials, was also produced for today’s court proceedings.
