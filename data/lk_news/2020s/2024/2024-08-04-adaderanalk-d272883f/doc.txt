Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena says that Sri Lanka is committed to reducing trade barriers as much as possible in a bid to improve cooperation, trade, and investment within the South Asian region.

Addressing the South Asian Trade Fair 2024, the Premier invited private sector businesses in the region to enter into the renewable energy trade, which possesses huge economic potential.

The South Asian Trade Fair 2024, organised by the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lanka and the SAARC Chamber of Commerce, commenced recently in Colombo.

The event was graced by Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena and officials including SAARC Secretary General Golam Sarwar, SAARC Chamber of Commerce President Jashim Uddin, FCCI President Keerthi Gunawardane, members of other business chambers, and High Commissioners and Ambassadors of the South Asian countries.

During the event, a special commemorative stamp and a first-day cover were also issued to mark the opening of the South Asia Trade Fair 2024.
