Medicine procurement scandal: TISL files petition, seeks to recover costs incurred

The Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) has filed a fundamental rights (FR) petition before the Supreme Court seeking an order that the fundamental rights have been violated through the purchase of certain types of drugs including Human Immunoglobulin vials, without following the proper procurement process.

Accordingly, 66 individuals including former Minister of Health Keheliya Rambukwella, Cabinet of Ministers, Treasury Secretary, Auditor General, Director General of Customs, Inspector General of Police, the members and the Director General of Bribery Commission and the Attorney General have been named as respondents of the relevant petition.

In the petition, the TISL sought the courtâ€™s intervention to declare that importation of pharmaceuticals without competitive bids was wrongful and illegal.

Further, the TISL requested the court to instruct the Auditor General to conduct a special inquiry into the decision to procure medical supplies from medical suppliers to whom Waivers of Registration had been issued, and compute the cost incurred by procuring medical supplies through them.

The petitioning party has further requested the court to direct the Attorney General to conduct an investigation into the other persons identified to have obtained financial or other benefits through the procurement of medical supplies through the use of Waivers of Registration.

Meanwhile, they have also requested the court to direct the Attorney General to take measures to recover the costs incurred to the State or the public, and seek compensation from the relevant parties mentioned in the petition.
