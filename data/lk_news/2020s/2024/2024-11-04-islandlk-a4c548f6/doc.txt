David Pieris Group reaffirms commitment to environmental conservation

David Pieris Group renewed its sponsorship of the hoardings displayed around Minneriya National Park for the 22nd consecutive year. In addition, the Group also announced its continued funding of the regular cleaning of the stretch of the park bordering the road from Minneriya to Habarana. This marks the 7th consecutive year of this initiative.

In a simple ceremony held at the park entrance recently, Samantha Silva, Director, David Pieris Motor Company (Private) Limited, officially handed over 68 hoardings and boards that feature conservation messages to the park administration.

Celebrated by Lonely Planet, BBC, and CNN, the Great Elephant Gathering brings together hundreds of Asian elephants at Minneriya National Park. It is also known as the 6th largest animal congregation in the world, and the largest gathering of Asian Elephants in the world, making it something all Sri Lankansâ€™ should take pride in.
