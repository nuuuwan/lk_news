Opposition members of CC had acted in an irresponsible manner: PM

Opposition members of the Constitutional Council (CC) have acted in an irresponsible manner by publishing inside information on the meeting held by the CC to decide on the Inspector General of Police, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardene told Parliament today.

"There have been issues and disagreements between CC members in the past but no member had disclosed them. However the opposition members of the current CC had disclosed inside information. This is an irresponsible act," the Premier said.
