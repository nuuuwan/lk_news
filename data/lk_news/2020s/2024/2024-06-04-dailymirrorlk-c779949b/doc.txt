SC stays indictment signed by DG Bribery Commission

Colombo, June 04, (Daily Mirror) - The Supreme Court today issued an interim order suspending the operation of an indictment signed by the Director General of the Bribery Commission against Land Commissioner General Bandula Jayasinghe in 2023.

Land Commissioner General Bandula Jayasinghe was indicted with seven others in December 2023 by the Director General of the Bribery Commission on a corruption charge relating to the change of a registration of a car whilst in the Department of Motor Traffic.

The Supreme Court bench comprising justices Yasantha Kodagoda, A.H.M.D. Nawaz and Achala Wengappulli issued formal notice and an interim order suspending the proceedings on the indictment signed by the Director General of Bribery Commission. The Supreme Court also made order that the Bribery Commission reconsiders its position on the indictment signed by the Director General during the interim period.

In his writ application, the petitioner stated that the Anti-Corruption Act did not envisage the continuation of the office of the previous Director General. The petitioner further stated that the entire premise of the new act was the appointment of a new Director General. He said that as a result the previous Director General could not have signed an indictment in December 2023.

Counsel Hafeel Farisz with N.K Ashokbaran, Shannon Thilekrathne and Shermina Bangsajaya appeared for the Petitioner. Senior Deputy Solicitor General Shanil Kularatne appeared for the Attorney General. Counsel Anusha Sandarapperuma appeared for the Bribery Commission.
