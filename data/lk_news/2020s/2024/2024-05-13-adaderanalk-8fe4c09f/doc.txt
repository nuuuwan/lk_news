Health trade unions launch strike at Central Province hospitals

A collective health sector trade unions have launched a token strike at all hospitals in the Central Province today (13) over their demands including an increase in allowances.

Accordingly, the Co-Convenor of the Health Trade Union Alliance Ravi Kumudesh stated the strike will be expanded to other provinces as well starting from May 22, if their demands are not met.

Commenting in this regard, the Director General of Trade Unions to the President, Saman Rathnapriya expressed that the primary concern with regard to this issue has been addressed, while affirming the decision to allocate the allowance in question. Additionally, he noted that the relevant circular has already been issued.

“However, a small section [of health workers] have not received this allowance. We have requested the Health Minister to submit a cabinet paper requesting the allocation of the allowance for them. I think he is working on it”, he said.

“However, they still have decided to resort to trade union action. It would be preferable to postpone this decision and allow the [authorities] to resolve this matter”, Mr. Rathnapriya added.

Meanwhile, Minister of Education, Susil Premajayantha says that the proposals concerning the monthly allowance and wage disparity of university non-academic staff will be tabled during the Cabinet meeting which is scheduled to be held today (13).
