Private sector rice imports total 67,000 MT as deadline ends

Sri Lanka Customs confirmed that a total of 67,000 metric tons of rice were imported by traders before the private sectorâ€™s rice import deadline expired at midnight yesterday (20).

The import initiative was part of measures to address domestic supply needs as the local markets saw a shortage of several types of rice and price hikes recently.
