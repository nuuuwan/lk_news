Heavy showers above 100mm expected in parts of the island

The Meteorology Department says showery and windy conditions are expected to enhance during the next few days from today, due to pre-monsoonal conditions over the country and surrounding sea areas.

Cloudy skies can be expected over most parts of the island, it said.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in Western, Sabaragamuwa, North-western and Southern provinces and in Kandy and Nuwara-eliya districts.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places elsewhere of the island after 12.00 noon.

Heavy showers above 100mm are likely at some places in Western, Sabaragamuwa and North-western provinces and in Galle and Matara districts.

Fairly strong winds about 30-40 kmph can be expected at times in Southern province, the department said.

General public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
