HNB Assurance extends support for habitat restoration programme

HNB Assurance PLC has partnered with Biodiversity Sri Lanka (BSL), to support the Federation of Environmental Organizations (FEO Sri Lanka) and the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) by committing to an additional 15 hectares of invasive alien plant species (IAPS) removal within the Lunugamvehera National Park over the next three years.

This programme, focuses on the removal of Lantana Camara (S. Gandapana) and Eupatorium odoratum (S. Podi Singho Maran), which have been rapidly spreading and disrupting the native ecosystem across 900 hectares, creating a sustainable livelihood and a sense of ownership for the community around this national park.

Lasitha Wimalaratne, CEO of HNB Assurance PLC, emphasized the importance of this collaboration, stating “our partnership with Biodiversity Sri Lanka has shown remarkable results in the past through this project and we are committed to deepening our engagement to amplify the impact we can further create. As a company, ‘protection’ is in the core of everything we do, thus, this project serves as an extension to this commitment – fostering a harmonious coexistence between humans and the wildlife, enabling the surrounding communities to live and let live.”
