India Sri Lanka passenger ferry service resumes

ECONOMYNEXT  – A passenger ferry service between Sri Lanka’s Jaffna and India’s Nagapatnam has resumed on August 16, with 50 passengers arriving in the maiden voyage, the Indian High Commission in Colombo said.

“Future plans include the exploration of additional routes and services that will further expand connectivity and economic collaboration,” the Indian embassy said.

The ferry ‘Sivagangai’ run by a private operator, IndSri Ferry Services, completed the journey between Nagapattinam and KKS in approximately 4 hours, the embassy said.

India is subsidizing the service providing around 25 million Sri Lanka rupees a month for a year to cover fees and operating costs and Nagapatnam port.
