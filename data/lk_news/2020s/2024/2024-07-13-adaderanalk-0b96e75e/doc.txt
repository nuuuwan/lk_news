Special notice from Motor Traffic Dept. to vehicle owners

The Department of Motor Traffic has decided to blacklist the vehicles emitting excessive smoke, says the Vehicular Emission Test Trust Fund (VET) of the Department of Motor Traffic (DMT).

Director of VET Dasun Gamage stated that the public can make complaints regarding such vehicles through WhatsApp number 070 3500 525 of the DMT.

Furthermore, Gamage urged the vehicle owners not to obtain the Vehicle Emission Test Certificate only for the renewal of the revenue license.

He highlighted that even though many people are tempted to obtain the Vehicle Emission Test Certificate through fake tactics, the police officers and officers of DMT are conducting relevant inspections on the roads across the island.

He further explained that if excessive emission of smoke is observed, a maintenance order will be issued against the owner of the vehicle in question, otherwise, a prohibition order will be issued to the vehicle.
