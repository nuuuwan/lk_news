Train services disrupted on Up-country Line

Railway operations on the Up-country Line have been disrupted due to several fallen trees on the tracks between the Inguru Oya and Galabada railway stations since early this morning (23), according to an Ada Derana reporter.

The Department of Railways is currently working to clear the tracks and restore train services.

Meanwhile, the ‘Tikiri Menike’ train plying from Nanu Oya to Colombo Fort remains stopped at the Hatton railway station, awaiting the clearing of the railway tracks.
