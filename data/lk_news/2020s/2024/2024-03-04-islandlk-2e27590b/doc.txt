Final gig…on Sunday

Mirage, with Manilal, will be seen in action, in a different setting, this Sunday, March 10th, Down Under.

The event is called ‘Let’s Dance Together’ and will be held in Bentleigh, Melbourne.

What’s unique about this event is that it’s being held from 12 noon to 4 pm and will also celebrate the birthday of Mirage leader Donald Peiris, in a Thai Street Food/Thai Style setting…and Thai Buffet.

Also in attendance, to provide the right music for such an occasion, will be Esric Jackson with the band No Limit.

Esric, known as the Country King, is hugely popular in Melbourne and the Sri Lankans, over there, love his singing…and his style.

This is Mirage’s final gig, in Australia, and they are scheduled to head for Colombo early next week.
