ADB approves US$30mn loan for Sri Lanka renewable energy

ECONOMYNEXT – The Asian Development Bank has approved a 30 million dollar small expenditure financing facility (SEFF) for the Ceylon Electricity Board to support the sustainability of ongoing and future energy sector projects.

“This is Sri Lanka’s first SEFF, designed to support the operational sustainability of ADB-financed energy projects, promote initiatives to increase the share of renewable energy, and encourage private sector participation in the renewable energy sector, particularly in the context of the country’s economic challenges,” ADB Country Director for Sri Lanka Takafumi Kadono said.

The facility will finance post-completion activities of ADB-financed projects, feasibility studies for advanced renewable energy technologies, preparatory work for transmission and distribution upgrades, and capacity building in emerging technologies.

15 million dollars will be allocated to enhance the operational sustainability of the Moragolla Hydropower Plant, while the remaining 15 million will support activities aimed at facilitating renewable energy generation and grid integration.

The facility complements Sri Lanka’s broader power sector reforms and investment program, supported by ADB’s Power Sector Reforms and Financial Sustainability Program and the recently approved Power System Strengthening and Renewable Energy Integration project, ADB said in a statement.

The facility will strengthen the institutional capacity of the CEB to effectively integrate and manage renewable energy systems, adopt digital solutions, and support the sector’s transition toward a more sustainable and resilient energy future. (Colombo/Dec11/2024)
