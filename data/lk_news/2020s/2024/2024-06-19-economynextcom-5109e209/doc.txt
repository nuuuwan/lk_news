Sri Lanka hSenid to use IPO funds for market development

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka-based tech company hSenid Business Solutions will reallocate 350 million rupees raised through an initial public offering for acquisitions in APAC and East African regions, for market development instead.

Subject to obtaining the approval of shareholders by special resolution, “the Board of Directors proposes to utilize such sum for suitable market development activities during the current financial year ending March 31, 2025,” hSenid said in a stock exchange filing.

The money was originally allocated for ‘strategic acquisitions in APAC and East African regions’.

“The Board of Directors noted that the investments made by the Company into product and market development activities since the IPO, as highlighted under Objectives 1 and 2 in Section 5.6 of the Prospectus, are beginning to yield good results for the Company.”

“Given the risks and rewards profile involved in inorganic growth that is envisaged in strategic investments, organic growth as envisaged in market development activities is expected to yield better returns on investment.”

Shareholder approval will be sought for the reallocation of IPO proceeds at the company’s annual general meeting, hSenid said.

The trading of shares was halted on Tuesday pending disclosure. The share was trading up at 13.40 after the announcement on Wednesday. (Colombo/Jun19/2024)
