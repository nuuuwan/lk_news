Fifteen CEB employees interdicted over recent protest

Colombo, Jan. 19 (Daily Mirror)- Fifteen CEB employees, who were in charge of the payment counters have been interdicted for engaging in the recent protest by closing down payment counters and inconveniencing the consumers, CEB spokesman Engineer Noel Priyantha said.

He said these employees had attended the protest by closing down payment counters despite the Gazette notification declaing electricy supply as an essential service and a circular being issued cancelling the leave of all employees.

The protest was launched by the CEB trade unions claiming that plans were afoot to privatise the CEB.

Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara had instructed the CEB management to suspend the services of any employee who defies orders of the management and take disciplinary action accordningly.
