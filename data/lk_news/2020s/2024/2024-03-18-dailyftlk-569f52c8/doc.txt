CEBEU assures uninterrupted power supply despite arid weather

Amidst the persisting arid weather conditions, the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers’ Union (CEBEU) has assured the public that reservoir water levels remain sufficient to sustain uninterrupted power supply across the country.

Addressing concerns over dwindling water levels in reservoirs, CEBEU officials stated that despite a decrease to 70% capacity in Castlereigh and Maussakalle reservoirs from their peak levels, hydropower generation can continue unabated till reaching a threshold of 20% capacity.

The CEB revealed the water levels in key reservoirs, which include;  Maussakalle - 1,158.46 meters above sea level (masl), Castlereigh - 1,086.85 masl, Kotmale - 694.02 masl, Samalawewa - 453.41 masl, Victoria - 432.77 masl, and Randenigala - 229.94 masl, as of 6 p.m. yesterday.

The CEBEU officials underscored the feasibility of maintaining 24-hour electricity supply, citing a significant drop in coal prices in the international market as a contributing factor.

Data from the CEB indicated that 69.54% or 32.42 GWh of electricity was generated from fossil fuels, while 30.45% or 14.2 GWh were generated from renewable energy sources as of Saturday.

Meanwhile, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) has issued a public appeal to conserve water resources amidst the challenging weather conditions. NWSDB Deputy Director General Anoja Kaluarachchi highlighted ongoing efforts to manage water distribution, particularly in areas experiencing heightened water consumption.

She emphasised the need for prudent water usage, noting that out of the 15 affected water tanks, nine are currently at manageable levels. Efforts are underway to distribute water to impacted areas such as Kandy, Urubokka, Gampolawatta, Pullella, Pusselawa, Hatton and Kotagala.
