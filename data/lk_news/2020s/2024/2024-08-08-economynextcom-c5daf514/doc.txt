Sri Lanka unlikely to change fuel, gas prices ahead of polls: sources

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is unlikely to change prices of fuel and gas until the September 21 presidential poll, two government sources said.

Sri Lankan government-owned entities revise fuel and gas prices on the first day of every month. State owned fuel retailer and gas supplier kept the prices steady early this month.

“Fuel and gas prices are likely to be unchanged until September,” a top government official told EconomyNext, asking not to be named.

Another government source said any price revision in line with the pricing formula could have positive or negative impact on election campaign.

“If the prices increased, it will be negative to the government and if the prices reduced, it will be positive to the government,” the second source said.

Sri Lanka has reduced the prices of fuel and gas in the recent months before the declaration of election date. (Colombo/August 08/2024)
