Two inmates dead, one critical after ‘food poisoning’ at Magazine Prison

The Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) has issued an open verdict regarding the autopsy of the two prison inmates who had allegedly died after consuming a rice parcel containing pork curry.

Subsequantly, their body parts are expected to be taken to the Medical Research Institute of Sri Lanka (MRI) for further tests.

Two individuals, residents of Borella and Dehiwala areas, had been arrested for trafficking ‘Ice’ drugs (crystal methamphetamine) and were detained at the Magazine Prison.

According to reports, relatives of one the inmates had brought a parcel of rice with pork curry prepared at home for the inmates on the day before.

Approximately 15 inmates had reportedly consumed this rice parcel, leading to three of the inmates being admitted to the Colombo National Hospital due to suspected food poisoning.

Two of the inmates have later died, while another inmate remains in critical condition at the hospital.

The autopsies of the deceased were conducted yesterday (7), with the open verdicts issued thereafter.

However, the Department of Prisons has announced that an internal investigation will be conducted regarding this incident.
