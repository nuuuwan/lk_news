IMF agrees to increase relief measures for people – President’s Advisor

President’s Adviser on Economic and Financial Affairs Prof. Anil Jayantha says the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has agreed to enhance the relief measures provided to the people of Sri Lanka.

He revealed that the relevant proposals for this increase in relief will be submitted to the IMF in the near future.

Prof. Jayantha emphasized that the current government’s primary focus is on boosting the support extended to the public, particularly as part of its efforts to revive the economy.

“During our discussions with the IMF, we made it clear that in order to stimulate economic recovery, the basic needs of the people—food, drink, and fertilizer for farmers—must be met. The IMF did not oppose the idea of increasing relief and encouraged us to present our programs,” Prof. Jayantha stated.

He further added that the government is actively working with other institutions linked to the IMF to expedite the delivery of assistance.

“We are committed to ensuring that this relief reaches the people as soon as possible, enabling them to actively contribute to the country’s production process,” he added.
