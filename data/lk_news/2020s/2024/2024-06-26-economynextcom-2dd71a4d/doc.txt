Sri Lanka announced that it had reached a ‘final restructuring agreement’ on 5.8 billion US dollars of bilateral debt coming under an Official Creditor Committee in Paris.

“We have only reached an agreement with the Official Creditor Committee,” Softlogic Stockbrokers said. “This has made institutions and big players confident, but retail investors, which make up a majority, were not active. So market was down overall.”

China Exim Bank, which has given 4,668.8 billion dollars in credit, discussed restructuring with Sri Lanka on a separate but parallel track.
