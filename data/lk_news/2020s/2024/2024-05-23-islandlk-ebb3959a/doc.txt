EY GDS Sri Lanka advocates for social equity and gender balance in the corporate sector

In a powerful move to promote inclusivity, EY Global Delivery Services (EY GDS) Sri Lanka hosted an impactful panel discussion on social equity. The forum featured influential women leaders who shared their experiences and perspectives to drive progress in workplace diversity, both within the EY organization and in the wider community.

The panelists, including Kasturi Chellaraja, the first female Group CEO of a public-quoted conglomerate in Sri Lanka; Sandra De Zoysa, the first female Chairperson of the Sri Lanka Association for Software and Services Companies (SLASSCOM); and Ashanthi Weerasinghe, co-founder of one of the largest fitness center networks in Sri Lanka, offered valuable insights about dismantling societal biases and creating equal opportunities.

Highlighting a stark gender disparity in Sri Lanka’s ICT sector—where women represent a mere 30% of the workforce despite high educational attainment—the event underscored the need for urgent action to close the gender gap in technology.

Marking two years of its presence in Sri Lanka, EY GDS reiterated its commitment to diversity, and has successfully achieved and maintained a 50:50 gender-balanced workforce.
