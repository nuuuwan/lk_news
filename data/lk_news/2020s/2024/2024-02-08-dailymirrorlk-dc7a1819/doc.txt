Colombo, Feb 08 - (Daily Mirror) -Â  Rividhanavi (Pvt) Ltd., a consortium comprising Lakdhanavi Ltd., Windforce PLC, and The Blue Circle Pte Ltd of Singapore, has inked the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) today, marking a significant stride in the renewable energy landscape of Sri Lanka.

The agreement pertains to the 100 MW Ground Mount Solar project located in Siyambalanduwa.

This endeavour, which has been in the pipeline since its advertisement by the CEB in September 2022, underwent thorough evaluation throughout 2023.

With an anticipated investment totaling USD 132 million, the consortium is poised to catalyze substantial progress in Sri Lanka's renewable energy sector.
