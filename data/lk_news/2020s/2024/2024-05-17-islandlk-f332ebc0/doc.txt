Cross Border Partnership: It’s ‘JumJum’ for PickMe in Nepal— IFC endorses move to support Nepal’s startup ecosystem

PickMe has crossed digital borders and will take the ride hailing market by storm with the launch of their latest technology partnership, JumJum (Let’s Go) in Nepal, a country where 78% of 3.22 million vehicles registered are motorcycles. Named as the Motorcycle city, Kathmandu Valley claims to have over a million motorcycles on their busy roads.

PickMe’s CEO Zulfer Jiffry says it made perfect sense to launch their services for Nepal’s motorcycle segment. JumJum will initially launch in the Kathmandu valley, which is said to be home to 40% of the 2.5 million registered motorbikes in Nepal.

The App which is called JumJum to give a more local feel for Nepali users, is a tech collaboration between PickMe and the largest fintech service provider ‘F1Soft’ in Nepal. “This strategic partnership is the culmination of a long search in South Asia to take our services to another country in the region. We have done it in a manner that adds value to the Nepali economy, by engaging with an acclaimed Nepalese tech company.” says the CEO.

In 2018, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) made a $2.5 million equity investment in PickMe – the first start-up IFC backed in Sri Lanka – to help the company expand across the island and increase access to affordable, safe, and efficient transportation. “Over the years, PickMe excelled in diversifying their products and services by expanding beyond ride-hailing to being a logistics company and also a pioneer in delivering necessities, especially during crises.

It also became a platform which helped create jobs and new economic opportunities for many, including for women. At IFC, we are delighted to see PickMe going across borders and venturing into newer markets, supporting the growth of Nepal’s startup ecosystem,” said Alejandro Alvarez de la Campa, Country Manager for IFC in Sri Lanka and Maldives.
