Sri Lanka president appoints independent committee to review central bank salary hike

ECONOMYNEXT — President Ranil Wickremesinghe has appointed an Independent Remuneration Committee that includes former governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy to review a controversial salary increase at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL).

An official from the President’s Media Division (PMD) said the committee was formed by Wickremesinghe in his capacity as Minister of Finance, on the recommendation of parliamentary Committee on Public Finances (CoPF).

The committee comprises Dinesh Stephen Weerakoddy, Arjuna Herath, former central bank governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy, Sudharma Karunarathne, Anthony Nihal Fonseka, Anushka S Wijesinha and Duminda Hulangamuwa.

The CoPF on March 20 recommended the suspension of a steep salary hike the for the central staff.

The central bank paid its staff salary hikes of 70 percent or more after the latest currency crisis it triggered by rate cuts, impoverishing a large section of the population.

The central bank has claimed that it is independent under a new law, but the COPF insisted that it came under the constitution where control of public finances was vested with parliament.

“The central bank’s accountability to parliament established,” de Silva tweeted on March 21.

“Central Bank Governor informed COPF today that they accepted all recommendations from COPF report on salary revisions.

“President Ranil Wickremesinghe to review salaries, until which salary increases will be deferred from next month.”

Sri Lanka’s central bank busted the rupee from 4.70 to the US dollars from the time it was created in 1950 to 360 to the US dollar in 2022 with inflationary policy.

But it has allowed the currency to appreciate to 303 to the US dollar since March 2022, amid deflationary policy (selling down CB-held securities) under Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe. (Colombo/Apr01/2024)
