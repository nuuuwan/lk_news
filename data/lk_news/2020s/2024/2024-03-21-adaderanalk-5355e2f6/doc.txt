IMF delegates meet with Sajith Premadasa

The visiting delegation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has met with Sri Lankan Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa at the parliament complex on Wednesday (March 20).

The Samagi Jana Balawegaya members emphasized that the prevailing economic situation could have been averted had the government aptly responded to their earlier calls urging them to reach out to the global lender.

While pointing out that they are in agreement with the roadmap presented by the IMF to help Sri Lankaâ€™s economic recovery process, the SJB members went on to highlight that certain proposals require amendments.

They further highlighted that the management of public finances should be done in a sustainable manner to save the country from bankruptcy.

The IMF delegation consisting of Peter Breuer, the Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka; Katsiaryna Svirydzenka, the Deputy Mission Chief for Sri Lanka; and Sarwat Jahan, the Resident Representative for Sri Lanka were in attendance at this meeting.

Representing the opposition were, MPs Dr. Harsha de Silva, Eran Wickramaratne, Kabir Hashim, Niroshan Perera, Prof. G. L. Pieris, Dr. Nalaka Godahewa, Chandima Weerakkody, Velu Kumar and Harshana Rajakaruna.
