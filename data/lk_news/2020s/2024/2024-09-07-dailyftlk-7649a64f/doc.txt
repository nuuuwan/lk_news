Ranil and Anura cannot stop Sajith’s victory: Marikkar

Accuses President Ranil Wickremesinghe of indirectly urging UNP supporters to vote for AKD

Claims Wickremesinghe is deliberately attempting to undermine SJB leader Sajith Premadasa’s chances

Alleges Wickremesinghe and AKD have arrived at a pact behind closed doors

Challenges NPP to prove they did not accept any benefits under Wickremesinghe’s Govt. in 2016

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP S.M. Marikkar has accused President Ranil Wickremesinghe of covertly urging United National Party (UNP) supporters to back National People’s Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake in the upcoming Presidential election.

Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Marikkar claimed that Wickremesinghe is deliberately attempting to undermine SJB leader Sajith Premadasa’s chances, knowing he himself is unlikely to win. Marikkar argued that this is why Wickremesinghe is suggesting that Dissanayake will win, to motivate his supporters to vote for him.

Marikkar further alleged that Wickremesinghe’s statements indicate a secret pact between Wickremesinghe and Dissanayake made behind closed doors. “All sides have begun attacking Premadasa because they know he will win,” Marikkar said.

He also challenged Dissanayake and other NPP leaders to disclose whether they accepted car permits and housing designated for MPs under the 2016 Government led by Wickremesinghe. “Anura, if you are clean, then reveal this information publicly. I challenge you,” Marikkar demanded.

He claimed that SJB members have not accepted any benefits from Wickremesinghe, including bar permits, State vehicles, or land allocations.

Addressing a recent viral video showing him in conversation with Wickremesinghe, Marikkar dismissed it, stating that such videos would not derail Premadasa’s campaign in Colombo.

“Neither Ranil nor Anura can prevent Premadasa’s victory in the Colombo district,” he asserted.
