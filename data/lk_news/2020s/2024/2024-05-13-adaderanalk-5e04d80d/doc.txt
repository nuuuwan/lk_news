O/L examination centres with Anula Vidyalaya also serving as an examination coordination centre.

The Nugegoda Magistrate issued this order as per a request made by the Inspector of Mirihana Police based on the information received that the agitators have planned to use loudspeakers and perform street plays during their protest march which is set to be held today (13).
