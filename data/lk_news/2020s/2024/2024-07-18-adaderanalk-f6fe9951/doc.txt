Advisory issued for strong winds

The Department of Meteorology has issued an ‘Amber’ level advisory for strong winds in Western slopes of the central hills and Northern, North-central and North western provinces and in Trincomalee, Monaragala and Hambanthota districts.

The advisory which is in effect until 05.30 a.m. on Friday (19), warned that strong winds of about 50-60 kmph can be expected at times over Western slopes of the central hills and in Northern, North- central and North western provinces and in Trincomalee, Monaragala and Hambanthota districts due to the increase of south-west monsoonal wind flow over the island.

Meanwhile, fairly strong winds about 30-40 kmph can be expected at times elsewhere of the island, it added.
