Sri Lanka, Saudi Arabia to cooperate in promoting direct investment

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will sign a memorandum of understanding for cooperation in promoting direct investment, Cabinet spokesman minister Bandula Gunawardena said.

“Both sides reached an agreement,” during the special meeting of the World Economic Forum held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Gunawardena told reporters on Thursday.

The agreement “aims to attract direct investment to the country and improve the investment environment of both countries through policy and legal reforms, provision of advanced and integrated infrastructure, process redesign, etc.”

Sri Lanka lagged behind regional nations in attracting foreign direct investment, the minister said. “Compared to Singapore which last year attracted FDIs of 140 billion dollars, India 70 billion dollars, Vietnam 28 billion dollars, and Thailand 20 billion dollars, Sri Lanka only attracted 1 billion dollars.”

“We hope for foreign investments in a big way, to solve our balance deficit crisis.” (Colombo/Jun20/2024)
