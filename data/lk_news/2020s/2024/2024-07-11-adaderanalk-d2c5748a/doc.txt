Wanindu Hasaranga resigns from captaincy

Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) today announced that the National Men’s T20I Captain Wanindu Hasaranga has decided to resign from the captaincy.

Hasaranga said it is in the best interest of Sri Lanka Cricket that he decided to relinquish the captaincy duties and remain in the side as a player, the statement said.

“Sri Lanka will always have my utmost best efforts as a player, and I will support and stand by my team and leadership as always,” said Wanindu Hasaranga in his resignation letter.

“Sri Lanka Cricket, while accepting his resignation, wishes to state that Hasaranga will remain an important player for us in our international cricketing plans,” the SLC statement said.

Batsman Charith Asalanka is tipped to be appointed as the next Sri Lanka T20I captain, according to sources.

Wanindu’s resignation comes following Sri Lanka’s group stage exit from the 2024 men’s T20I World Cup last month.

Hasaranga had only been in charge of the T20I side for six months after he was appointed to the role in January earlier this year when Dasun Shanaka’s time as captain of both Sri Lanka men’s white ball sides came to an end.

The allrounder started off his reign with a series win over Zimbabwe, before also recording a 2-1 series win over Afghanistan ahead of the T20 World Cup.

The resignation follows that of head coach Chris Silverwood, who resigned from his role shortly after Sri Lanka were eliminated from the competition. Silverwood had been in charge of the side in all three formats since April 2022.
