Anuradhapura sacred area declared a rabies-free zone

Colombo, June 6 (Daily Mirror) - The Anuradhapura Municipal Commissioner declared the Anuradhapura sacred area as a rabies-free zone, assuring devotees that there is no need for concern, the Association of Veterinarians for Humane Management of Animal Population said.

Municipal Commissioner Ruwan Wijesinghe said there is no danger of rabies within the Anuradhapura Municipal Council area due to the highly organized anti-rabies programmes over the last four years.

He said that rabies vaccinations had been administered to stray dogs during World Rabies Day every year for four consecutive years, and more than 90% of the stray dogs have been operated on.

As bringing animals from other areas into the city is still a problem, he requests the people to take care of the animals responsibly and not leave them stranded and helpless.

It is further requested that the people in the areas bring the animals to the clinics organized by the Municipal Council and get rabies vaccinations administered.

Targeting Poson Poya day, a special anti-rabies vaccination programme has been organized from 5 a.m. tomorrow (June 7) for the dogs that hang around the sacred area.
