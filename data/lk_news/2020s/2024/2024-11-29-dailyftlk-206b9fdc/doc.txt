Vigneswaran to push recognition of North and East as Tamil speaking regions

Former Northern Province Chief Minister and Tamil Makkal Thesiya Kootani (TMTK) party leader C. V. Vigneswaran PC has announced plans to form an alliance of Tamil nationalist parties aimed at securing official recognition of the Northern and Eastern provinces as Tamil-speaking regions.

This development comes in the wake of a significant shift in voting patterns during the last parliamentary elections, where traditional Tamil nationalist parties faced notable setbacks in these regions. The National People’s Power (NPP) emerged as a key player, winning substantial support across the North and East, signalling a shift in the political dynamics of the area.

Speaking to the media this week, Vigneswaran confirmed that discussions are underway among parties committed to Tamil nationalism to establish a unified front. “This alliance is being formed to press the Government to formally recognise the North and East as Tamil-speaking regions,” he said.

Reflecting on the election results, Vigneswaran acknowledged that many votes traditionally aligned with two major Tamil political factions had shifted to the NPP. He noted that first-time voters also played a role in this shift, adding, “The support for other Tamil parties has not decreased, but the votes previously aligned with specific politicians have been redirected.”

Amidst these political shifts, he also commended the Government’s decision to allow families in the North to commemorate relatives lost in the war.

“The Government has taken some positive steps, including the decision to allow people to commemorate those who lost their lives in the war. This move has been well-received by the public and political parties alike,” he said.
