Dayasiri Jayasekara also resigns as COPE member

MP Dayasiri Jayasekara has also stepped down as a member of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE).

It is understood that Jayasekara has forwarded his letter of resignation to the Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena.

His resignation came a day after Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Eran Wickramaratne resigned from his position as a COPE member.

In his resignation letter, Wickramaratne explained that no credible action had been taken on those who were found to have been complicit in corrupt practices or mismanagement despite the COPE reports submitted to the parliament time and time again.

He also took issue with the appointment of Rohitha Abeygunawardena, a ruling party MP, as the COPE chairman despite the previous government adopting a practice of appointing an Opposition member to chair the committee to strengthen the principle that the legislature must be a check and balance on the executive arm of government.

In addition, Wickramaratne highlighted that it is dissatisfying that members who have been appointed to COPE have allegations against their personal conduct, particularly on financial transactions and that this also contributes to the citizenâ€™s loss of confidence in Parliament.
