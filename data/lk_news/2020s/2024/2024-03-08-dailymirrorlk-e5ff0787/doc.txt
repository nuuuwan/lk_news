Maskeliya, March 8 (Daily Mirror) -Â Three tons of plastic bottles discarded by pilgrims visiting Sri Pada have been collected within three months since the beginning of the Sri Pada season this year,Maskeliya Pradeshiya Sabha announced.

Secretary of the maskeliya Pradeshiya Sabha S. Rajaweeran said garbage bins have been installed to dispose of plastic water bottles carried by pilgrims travelling along that route.

He said, however, some pilgrims just throw plastic water bottles into the environment without putting them into garbage bins.

The plastic water bottles discarded by Sri Pada pilgrims were taken to the garbage recycling center in Nallathanniya, from where it will be sold to the private sector, the secretary said.

Meanwhile, the current extremely dry weather condition has caused a drinking water problem in the Nallathanniya area. Discussions are underway with the Water Supply Board to solve this issue, according to the secretary.
