Sri Lanka’s inflation rate rises to 4.2% in December

Sri Lanka’s consumer price inflation rate rose to 4.2% year-on-year in December from 2.8% in November, the statistics department said on Monday.

The National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) captures broader retail price inflation and is released with a lag of 21 days every month.

Food prices rose 1.6% in December after falling 2.2% in November on the year, the Department of Census and Statistics said in a statement.

Prices for non-food items, however, fell 6.3% in December from 7.1% year-on-year in November.

Sri Lanka racked up record high inflation last year after its economy was pummelled by the worst financial crisis in decades, triggered by a plunge in foreign exchange reserves.
