Sri Lanka in final steps of completing debt restructuring – CBSL Governor

The Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe says that Sri Lanka will record positive annual economic growth in 2024 for the first time since the economic crisis.

Joining Ada Derana’s current affairs program “At HydePark”, the CBSL chief highlighted the need to persist along the narrow positive economic path it trails at the moment.

Furthermore, Dr. Weerasinghe noted that Sri Lanka is in the final steps of completing the debt restructuring programme and has almost achieved the short-term economic sustainability.

He also mentioned that, as part of the long-term plan for the economic revival of the country, Sri Lanka must ensure an economic growth rate between 4% and 5% in the coming years, while preserving the short term gains of the country under the restructuring programme.
