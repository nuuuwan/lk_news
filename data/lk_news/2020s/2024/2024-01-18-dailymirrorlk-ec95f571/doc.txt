If VAT is charged, VAT registration certificate must be displayed

Yatiyantota, Jan 18 (Daily Mirror) - Every business or industry with a turnover of Rs. 80 million per annum must be registered for Value Added Tax (VAT), and the VAT registration certificate must be displayed so that everyone can see it, Finance State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

While addressing the media after a meeting in Yatiyantota this morning, he said although the current limit for paying VAT is Rs. 80 million per year, necessary legislative arrangements will be made to bring the annual turnover down to Rs. 60 million soon.

He also said that if the VAT registration number is not displayed, there is no hindrance to the Inland Revenue Department to take legal action against those who do not do so.
