Online Safety Act: Amendments to be cleared by Cabinet today

The new amendments to the recently introduced Online Safety Act will be presented to the Cabinet for approval today, an official said.

The government took steps hurriedly to amend the law immediately after it took effect, following pressure from tech companies such as Google, Yahoo, Amazon and Meta and the international community.

The tech companies argued the Act, unless amended, would affect the digital economy of the country.
