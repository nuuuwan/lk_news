Health workers to strike again amidst unresolved dispute

Colombo, Jan 18 (Daily Mirror) -Â  The Alliance of Health Trade Unions has announced the resumption of their suspended health strike, scheduled to commence on February 1.

The decision stems from a unanimous consensus reached during a special conference convened today, which brought together representatives from 72 health services unions.

The Ministry of Health had previously acknowledged the reasonableness of the economic justice proposal presented for health staff.

However, despite the strike being initially called off on 17th as a gesture of cooperation until the President's intervention, the Health Ministry's subsequent decisions were perceived as serious and unfair.

Besides, the leadership conference, meeting today, unanimously opted to protest against the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Finance for what they view as undue pressure on the healthcare services.
