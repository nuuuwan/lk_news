Dilith urges to entrust ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ with fulfilling responsibility of strong opposition

Leader of the ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ alliance and Gampaha District candidate, entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera stated that the public should entrust the responsibility of forming a strong opposition to the ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ alliance after the upcoming parliamentary elections.

He made these remarks during a public meeting held yesterday (20) in Panadura.

“Now our President Anura Kumara is in a lot of trouble because he became President without an economic plan.” He stated that someone else had the plan, but they are not giving him the book, and that a few pages are missing from it.

“Now, the President needs to call and ask what to do next. We are not like that,” he said.

“We propose to Anura Kumara that we are coming to the opposition, and you will form your government. We will help you with any good work.”

“He has already said that the salary of government employees will be increased every six months. We will help with that. He also promised petrol at Rs. 200, and we will support that too,” the ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ leader added.

Jayaweera mentioned that they had advised Anura Kumara not to make statements about stolen funds hidden in Uganda, as it could be perceived as a joke.

He added that while there may be no funds hidden in Uganda, his alliance is aware of the funds that were taken out of Sri Lanka.

He further explained, “Our program outlines how to bring it back, what legal measures are necessary, and how commissions should be established. It’s all in our plan.”

Jayaweera expressed that Anura Kumara has the ability to take necessary measures to recover the lost wealth. He further stated that there is no reason to appoint Sajith Premadasa as the leader of the opposition again.

“Therefore, it’s up to the people to decide that we don’t need him as the leader of the opposition,” he said.
