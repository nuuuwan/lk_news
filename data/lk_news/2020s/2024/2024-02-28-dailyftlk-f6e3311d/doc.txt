SLPP’s Uddika Premarathne quits Parliament due to disillusionment

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Anuradhapura district MP Uddika Premarathne resigned from his position as a Member of Parliament yesterday, submitting his resignation to Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena citing frustrations at being unable to enact significant change as a young leader within the Government.

In his letter, the MP expressed his initial aspirations to enter politics with the aim of instigating positive change and contributing as a youth leader, highlighting his disappointment at being unable to fulfil these ambitions.

“Given the recent series of incidents that have led to disillusionment, despite my status as a Government MP, I have not been actively given the opportunity to contribute as a youth leader,” he said.

The MP also observed that achieving his personal political aspirations and hopes would be challenging under the current circumstances. He said that as a result, he has decided to temporarily suspend his involvement in the parliamentary process and is therefore tendering his resignation.

Premarathne entered Parliament in 2020 after receiving 133,550 votes, the third highest from the Anuradhapura district.

Former Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MP S. C. Muthukumarana is now poised to replace Premarathne in Parliament, as he is next in line on the SLPP list from the district.
