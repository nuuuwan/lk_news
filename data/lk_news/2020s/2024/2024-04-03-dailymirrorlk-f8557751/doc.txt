Two suspects escape from police custody

Galle, April 3 (Daily Mirror)- Two suspects who were detained for further questioning escaped from the custody of the Galle police during the early hours today.

They had been arrested the previous day for having in their possession a stock of heroin and were being detained on a court order. One is from Bope and the other from Mainagoda in Galle.

However, the two young men had escaped custody when the reserve sergeant opened the remand cell to release another suspect on bail.

A police team is conducting investigations to track down the two escapees.
