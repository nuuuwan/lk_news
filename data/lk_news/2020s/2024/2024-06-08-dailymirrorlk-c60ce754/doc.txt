Sri Lanka logs 700 Dengue cases in seven days

Colombo, June 08 (Daily Mirror) - A total of 700 cases were reported over the past seven days, indicating a notable uptick in the Dengue outbreak.

The surge in cases can be attributed to rainy conditions and the receding floodwaters, which create more mosquito breeding sites.

As of June 07, a total of 25,619 cases have been reported in 2024, with the highest number being from the Colombo district, which stood at 5,554.

The Western Province has recorded 9,348 cases, the highest province-wise.

As several parts in Sri Lanka have experienced significant rainfall for the past few days, health officials urge people to keep their surroundings clean and destroy mosquito breeding places in order to keep Dengue at bay.
