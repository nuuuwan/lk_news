Sri Lanka Women clinch first-ever Asia Cup title

Sri Lanka women won their first-ever Women’s Asia Cup title as they beat seven-time champions India by 8 wickets in the final on Sunday.

Chasing the highest-ever target of 165 in the tournament for Sri Lanka, skipper Chamari Athapaththu smashed an impressive 61 runs with 2 sixes and 9 boundaries.

Having won the toss, India’s Captain Harmanpreet Kaur elected to bat first against Sri Lanka where they smashed 165 runs for the fall of 3 wickets.

Opener Shafali Verma, who scored 16, was the first strike for Sri Lanka Women. India’s Smriti Mandhana led the charge with a powerful 60, propelling India towards a formidable total.

Jemimah Rodrigues contributed a solid 29 before being run out, while Captain Harmanpreet Kaur was dismissed by Sri Lanka’s Sachini Nisansala for just 11 runs.

Sri Lanka’s Kavisha Dilhari picked up 2 wickets while Sachini Nisansala and Chamari Athapaththu bagged one wicket each.
