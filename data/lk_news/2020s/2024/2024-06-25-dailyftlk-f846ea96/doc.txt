The CMA Sri Lanka SME Development Committee comprises members from professional bodies, commercial banks and industry experts who have been meeting since April 2020 to find solutions and support the SME sector. They have organised conferences, workshops and UN MSME Day events annually since 2021. The UN General Assembly has declared 27 June Micro-, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Day, to raise public awareness of their contribution to sustainable development and the global economy.

The MSME sector is the backbone of most economies worldwide including Sri Lanka and plays a key role in developing countries. In Sri Lanka, MSMEs comprise more than 75% of enterprises and account for 52% of GDP, 45% of employment, and a meagre 5% in exports which we have recommended be increased with the setting up of Export Houses.

The CMA Sri Lanka SME Development Committee The CMA Sri Lanka COVID-19SME Development Committee under the leadership of Prof. Lakshman R. Watawala has been active since April 2020 and a significant achievement of the committee was fulfilling the great need to support those entrepreneurs who were unable to provide collateral or security to banks by recommending to the Ministry of Industries in 2020 to submit a Cabinet Paper to reactivate the stalled SME Credit Guarantee Institution which was supported by the ADB and was pending in the approved projects list and to restart this project immediately. This was subsequently approved by the Cabinet on 27 April 2021 and responsibility given to the ERD of the Finance Ministry who has now finalised the setting up of the NCGI which will be launched shortly.
