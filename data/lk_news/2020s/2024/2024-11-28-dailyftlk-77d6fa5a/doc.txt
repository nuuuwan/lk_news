Arrest warrants issued for Dan Priyasad and Mahinda Kahandagama in Gota Go Gama attack case

The Fort Magistrateâ€™s Court has issued arrest warrants for Sinhala nationalist activist Dan Priyasad and former Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Colombo Municipal Council member Mahinda Kahandagama in connection with the attack on the Gota Go Gama protest site at Galle Face Green on 9 May 2022.

The order, issued yesterday, came after the case was taken up in Court. While other suspects, including former Minister Johnston Fernando and Milan Jayatileke, were present, Priyasad and Kahandagama failed to appear. Their legal counsels informed the Court that the duo is currently abroad.

Fort Magistrate Thanuja Lakmali directed law enforcement to arrest the two suspects and produce them in Court. The case is scheduled to be heard again on 26 March 2025.
