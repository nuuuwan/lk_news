Appeals Court defers decision on Keheliyaâ€™s petition against remand order

The Appeals Court has deferred its decision on the writ application filed by former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella challenging the remand order issued by the Maligakanda Magistrate.

The decision, which was scheduled to be delivered today (30), is now expected to be communicated on 07 May.

The writ application was called before Appeals Court Judge D.N. Samarakoon this morning.

The former health minister had put forward the relevant petition, seeking a court order invalidating the order issued by the Maligakanda Magistrate under the Public Property Act to remand him until the completion of the trial on substandard human immunoglobulin procurement.
