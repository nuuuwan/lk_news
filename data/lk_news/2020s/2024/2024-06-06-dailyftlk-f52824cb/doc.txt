AKD agrees to debate on ITN as Sajith remains mum

The National People’s Power (NPP) party, in a letter to the Independent Television Network (ITN), accepted its invitation for its leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake to engage in a televised debate with Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa today.

NPP Executive Council member Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa, in response to ITN’s offer to host the long-delayed economic debate between the two party leaders, stated that NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake is prepared to participate in the debate.

While thanking the channel for its offer, Dr. Jayatissa also requested ITN to inform the NPP of Premadasa’s confirmation of attendance, as it is not a usual political dialogue but an already scheduled debate. He asked ITN to notify the NPP if Premadasa will attend the event on the designated date and time.

However, at the time of writing, neither the SJB nor Premadasa had responded to ITN’s offer.

Earlier the SJB had presented several options for dates to the NPP and requested the party to pick one for the leader’s debate.

While the two political parties continued to tussle over organising the event, in response ITN Chairman Sudarshana Gunawardana, writing to both the SJB and NPP, offered to host the debate on the channel earlier this week.

“The proposed debate between Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake has been scheduled for Thursday, 6 June. We have organised the debate to take place in our media company’s HD studio on 6 June, starting at 10 p.m. and it will be broadcast live. We cordially invite you to participate in this debate,” the letter read.
