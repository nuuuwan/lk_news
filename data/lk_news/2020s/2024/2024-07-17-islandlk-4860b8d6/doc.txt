Passion for hurdling…

I’m currently pursuing my higher education in international business, as well as being an athlete, with a passion for hurdling. I am relatively new to the modelling field as I started my modelling career in December 2022 with BK Model Management.

I always admired runway modelling since I was a little girl and I think what attracted me more was the elegance and the confidence these runway models had. As I grew up, my friends told me to try out modelling as I had the height, and then I joined BK Academy and Brian Kerkoven saw my potential and signed me to his Agency which paved the way to all these amazing opportunities I’ve had..

One of the things I love about myself is my ability to always think positively, regardless of the situation, and my ability to endure failures and losses, I think I got this pattern of thinking mainly because of athletics. And I also think I have a pretty unique walk, thanks to Brian and Prathiba, who guided me through ramp walking.

I don’t really have a strict preference, but I like athleisure (hybrid style of athletic clothing) and sportswear the most. But I also like a long, flowy dress that’s easy to just play around with.

05. What do you think is the most important aspect of modelling?

I personally think the most important aspect of modelling, or any career, is the way you carry yourself and present yourself. The way you communicate with others and, basically, having a strong influential personality matters a lot in this line of work.

06. If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?

Nothing really, but, perhaps, I would have preferred to be a bit taller as it would be an advantage in modelling.

I went to Visakha Vidyalaya, and I was a very dedicated athlete in school, as well as balancing my studies…equally.

I celebrate all my academic, sports and career wins equally so it would be extremely difficult for me to pick one specific moment. I just would like to say that I’m extremely blessed to be surrounded by people that establish so many core memories in me.

My ultimate happiness would be being well educated, having a stable career and making my parents and myself proud of the way I’ve come.

Someone I can look up to in all aspects of life. Someone that would motivate me to do better and with a lot of patience because sometimes I can be a bit handful!

The living person I admire the most would be my mother as she’s a very strong driven woman who achieved her dreams among so many hardships. Her dedication and strategic planning are some things I always look up to and I honestly don’t know how she does it all. I strive daily to become the woman she would be proud of.

I don’t really have anything like that because even when I go out, I want to go relaxed, not carrying anything at all. But I think my phone is my most treasured possession because I basically have all the information and details I need to get by, on my phone.

13. If you were marooned on a desert island, who would you like as your companion?

Again I would say my mom would make a pretty good companion as I would feel safe and she would do all the work to get us out of the island as soon as possible.

To be honest I try to immediately forget all the embarrassing moments I come across because I don’t want myself to overthink years later. But I have come across many embarrassing instances where I would zone out in the middle of a presentation and be clueless about what I was going to say.

When I was little, me and my neighbour used to sneak out of our houses and climb to the roof of another neighbouring house where we made our “secret plans” for our “spy missions” in the neighbourhood.

Anywhere…with a beach. I’m a mix of both a city girl and a beach girl. But for a vacation I think I would love the beach setting more. My ideal vacation would be a girl’s trip to the beachside.

A little bit of everything – depending on my mood and the occasion. It could be Pop, R&B, Rap, Hip Hop, Afro and so much. My favourite all time artistes, I would say, are Taylor Swift and Drake.

Kiss FM because they have so many interesting programmes to listen to throughout the day and they play all my favourite songs!

So far I’m planning on finishing my bachelor’s degree and then go abroad to pursue Masters, or any further studies, while continuing athletics.
