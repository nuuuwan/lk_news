Sri Lanka mulls designating teaching an essential service

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said steps will be taken to designate teaching as an essential service to ensure the education of children.

Wickremesinghe “emphasized the importance of teachers being present in schools during morning hours to ensure the education of children, warning that if teachers fail to do so depriving students of their education, steps will be taken to designate teaching as an essential service,” the president’s media division quoted him as saying.

Wickremesinghe was reported to have said this during a discussion with the chief prelate of the Asgiri Chapter Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Nayaka Thera in Kandy on Thursday.

Declaring a service an ‘essential service‘ seeks to ensure that these services aren’t interrupted, usually by strike action.
