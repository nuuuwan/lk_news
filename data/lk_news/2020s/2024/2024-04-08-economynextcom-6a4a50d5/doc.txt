Sri Lanka opposes dissolution of Palestinian state: President

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s stance remains firm in opposing the dissolution of the Palestinian state, and stands in solidarity to end the ongoing conflict, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said at an Ifthar ceremony held Sunday at the Jumma Mosque in Katukele, Kandy.

“As Sri Lanka observes Ramadan today, a sombre situation unfolds in the Gaza Strip, where the Muslim community mourns the loss of approximately thirty-five thousand lives,” Wickremesinghe was quoted in a statement by his media division.

“In light of this tragedy, we have decided to forego the national Ramadan festival this year and allocate the funds to support the people of Gaza. Additionally, a commitment has been made to construct a school in Gaza once the conflict subsides.”

Contributions totaling 10 million rupees from Kathankudi Mosque, 2.2 million from Katu Kale Jumma Mosque, and 3.5 million from Muslim foreign employment agencies were handed over to President Ranil Wickremesinghe for distribution among the affected community.

“It’s noteworthy that Ramadan coincides with the Sinhala New Year, reflecting a culture of inclusivity transcending racial and religious barriers throughout our history.”

Wickremesinghe acknowledged past challenges faced by the community. “The recent pandemic posed challenges for the Muslim community in conducting proper last rites, causing immense distress.

“To address this, future legislation will enable individuals to carry out their last rites in accordance with their religious beliefs or final wishes, ensuring everyone’s right to burial or cremation. We are committed to formulating the necessary regulations to honour individuals’ preferences in this regard.”

Efforts are also underway to regulate Madrasa schools under the Ministry of Education, Wickremesinghe said. (Colombo/Apr8/2024)
