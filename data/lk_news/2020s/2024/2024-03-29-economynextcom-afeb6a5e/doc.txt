In the political arena, South Asian women face similar hurdles

ECONOMYNEXT – In South Asia, women face similar hurdles when breaking into the male-dominated political arena, a webinar on Empowering Voices: Exploring the Political Landscape for Women in South Asia heard.

Across the region, more often than not, women are nominated to fill a seat falling vacant by the death of a male family member, as the party leadership made up of men is confident of winning on the ‘sympathy vote,’ or simply to fill a quota, and not for their qualifications and capabilities.

In Sri Lanka, despite a hard-won battle for a 25 per cent quota for women at the Local Government level six years ago, the drive to have more women at decision making levels continues. It is yet to be seen if the new electoral system at the provincial level will yield the results women seek. Representation of women in the Sri Lankan Parliament is a dismal 5.3 per cent (only 12 of the 225 MPs are women), Dr Sudharshani Fernandopulle, MP pointed out.

Dr Fernandopulle, who entered politics in 2010 following the assassination of her husband, explained that while that first foray into politics was easy, as she contested to fill her husband’s seat and had the sympathy of the electorate, since then, it has been an uphill battle to continue to be nominated and to retain her seat.

On the panel, along with Dr Fernandopulle, were Sania Kamran, Member of the Punjab Provincial Assembly, Pakistan and Anusha Nepal, Communications Officer, Office of MP Gagan Kumar Thapa, Nepal. The webinar held on March 15, 2024, was moderated by Divya Jain, Strategic Advisor and Political Consultant, India, and organised by the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom, South Asia.

Though it’s the family connection that brings many women into politics, Fernandopulle added that under Sri Lanka’s proportional representation system, the battle is not simply between rival political party candidates, but within the party itself. In an environment where the party leadership is almost entirely male, with no women even on the nomination boards, interventions by female politicians to the General Secretaries of political parties to provide for better female representation have fallen on deaf ears, Fernandopulle alleges.

For the few who do get nominated, limited campaign funds, the reluctance to dabble in bribery to entice voters, negative portrayal in the media, and in some instances, being undermined by their own women who favour promoting male counterparts, are constant hurdles.  Unlike their male colleagues, women must also balance their family responsibilities, she added.

The Parliamentary Women’s Caucus meanwhile is refusing to take a step back; private members motion pushing for increased female representation at the legislature, and a call for an amendment to the preferential system where a vote for a woman would be mandatory is on the cards.

The Caucus is hopeful the legal reforms will be introduced before the next parliamentary election is called.  Interventions made to the Presidential Commission on electoral reforms have been received positively, she stated. As well, some civil society groups are providing training to women politicians and those aspiring to get into decision making positions.

It has not been an uphill battle for Anusha Nepal, who has the support of family and friends, and who has led election campaigns since 2020, ever since she became eligible to vote.

However, the same cannot be said for most other women politicians in her country, especially those living outside Kathmandu. Citing an example of women politicians receiving very little air time, she noted that when questioned, the Station Head of a broadcasting company had stated that accessing the women proved difficult. However, the women had claimed they were never contacted!

Campaign financing is one deterrent she added, pointing out that at the local level, 98 per cent of those holding the post of Chairman are males, while women must be content with a Deputy position. Women are objectified in the media, and though political parties nominate women at all levels, that is done only if it is a requirement.

In a country where only 23.8 per cent of women have access to land and finances, the struggle for equal representation at the hustings is all the more difficult in the male-dominated political structure, Nepal stated.

Pakistan’s Sania Kamran sees a need for more legislation that would pave the way for more women to enter politics and at all other decision-making levels. Women bring the expertise of running their homes and balancing household budgets but are considered unfit to hold decision-making positions in the public sphere, she points out.

As in other South Asian nations, they are used for the sympathy vote. Kamran points out that while women enter politics for a purpose, to bring about change in society, their male colleagues see it as an opportunity to further their business interests; for those hailing from feudal families or business empires, the paltry parliamentary salary is not the enticement, she points out.

Her colleagues marked International Women’s Day two years ago, as Safe Place Day, to sensitise their male counterparts to the issues females face, she said.   When a woman politician once brought her sick child to parliament, she was met with derision by the men, but today, the Punjab Assembly runs a daycare, she said.

Kamran also stated, that while women work diligently at the grassroots level, and raise awareness of the needs of the people, when that idea is brought to fruition, the males take the credit; for example, if a school is built the name plaque and recognition will be given to the male colleague.

In her bid to ensure equality, Kamran said she was instrumental in getting two seats for women in the Islamic Ideology Council.

She also believes that taking to the streets in protest is not the answer to resolving issues. Protests disrupt public life, and destabilise the economy, she says, adding that issues must be debated and resolved in parliament.

Addressing the webinar, the Chairwoman of the Committee on Human Rights and Humanitarian Aid, Renata Alt of the German Bundestag, pointed out that women are key players in achieving equality and peace. Yet they are underrepresented and discriminated against. Studies show there is a positive impact on development in countries where there is a higher participation of women in politics, she said.

The CEO of FNF, Annett Witte also addressed the webinar. (Colombo/Mar29/2024)
