Sri Lanka plans bootha price controls

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s combined harvesters for rice is next in line for price controls, according to statements made in a parliament, as price controls are also planned for three-wheelers and school vans in the wake of a currency crisis.

The price charged for harvesting rice by owners of harvesting machines (colloquially known as a boothaya) is to be regulated from the next Maha season, State Minister of Agriculture Mohan Priyadarshana De Silva said.

Member of Parliament Samanpriya Herath, said however, owners of combined harvesters had also bought the machines on lease and had to service debt.

“The industry is in danger of collapse, so that we also have to take into account.”

Due to competition between owners fees have come down in some cases.

Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardana said price regulations are being planned for three-wheelers and school vans.

“There was an idea earlier to set up a separate regulatory authority for three wheelers,” Gunawardana told reporters Tuesday.

“Now the plan is to bring then under the national transport commission which is regulating bus fares. The relevant law will be change to include three wheeler prices and school vans. (Colombo/Mar7/2024)
