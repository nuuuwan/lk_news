Fairly heavy showers expected in parts of the island

The Meteorology Department says showers or thundershowers will occur at several places in Western, Southern, Sabaragamuwa and Uva provinces after 2.00 p.m. with fairly heavy showers above 50 mm likely at some places.

Showers or thundershowers may occur at a few places in North-western and Central provinces and in Mannar and Vavuniya districts in the evening or night.

Misty conditions can be expected at some places in Western, Central, Sabaragamuwa and Uva provinces and in Galle and Matara districts during the morning.

General public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
