Petition filed against Ranjan Ramanayake’s nomination for General Election

A petition has been filed with the Supreme Court requesting an order to reject the nomination of former Member of Parliament Ranjan Ramanayake, who is contesting the upcoming general election under the “United Democratic Voice” party from the Gampaha District.

The petition, submitted by Gampaha District independent candidate K.M. Mahinda Senanayake, also seeks a ruling declaring that Ramanayake does not have the right to obtain a parliamentary seat or vote.

The Election Commission and its members, Ranjan Ramanayake, the Gampaha District Returning Officer, and several others have been named as respondents in the case.
