Wijeyadasa signs nomination papers for Presidential Election

Former Justice Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has signed his nomination papers to contest the upcoming Presidential Election, which is scheduled to be held on September 21.

He signed the nominations at his residence in Nawala amid the blessings of the Venerable Maha Sanga, said Ada Derana Reporter.

Rajapakshe had placed a deposit with the Election Commission as a candidate for the 2024 Presidential Election on August 01.

Rajapakshe had placed the deposit as the presidential candidate of the National Democratic Front.

It was initially stated that the former minister would be contesting this year’s presidential election with the support of the faction of former chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), ex-president Maithripala Sirisena.

However, when asked by a reporter as to whether Sirisena will support opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, Wijeyadasa responded by saying, “There is such news. I will get his support. I will accept it if received. And I will accept it even if I don’t…”

On July 25, the MP had officially announced that he would contest the upcoming Presidential Election while he had stepped down from his ministerial position as the Minister of Justice, Prisons Affairs and Constitutional Reforms on July 29.
