ANGHIES OF ROYAL

When Mr. B. C Anghie (BCA), Ben to his friends, joined the staff of Royal College (RC) as an Assistant Master way back in 1936, during the tenure of the then Principal Mr. L.H.W. Sampson, he may or may not have anticipated what a varied and multifaceted stewardship he was to bear, for a long stint of 16 years replete with passion and dedication,

BCA came over to RC from the staff of St. Peter’s College (SPC). As the relevant RC Magazine of 1952 records BCA “came over to us from SPC and is proud to recall that, when he joined Royal, a deputation of senior boys, led by the Head Prefect, came to him to welcome him and say how glad they were that he had come over to us.”

In class BCA had “a way of getting his pupils to work harder than they ever thought they could have”. He had got his pupils to do tutorials in History that made it necessary for them to use the resources of the Reference Library they had never used before! His pupils were also called upon to write ‘appreciations’ of English Literature, which required more than a passing acquaintance of the relevant texts and of the works of recognized critics.

Though he joined RC as an Asst. Master with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, his call was not confined to the classroom alone, teaching Latin, English, History and allied subjects. He soon got involved in a profusion of activities, which placed him among a galaxy of dedicated teachers then adorning Royal such as, eg., the awe-inspiring I.H. Wijesinghe,P.I.Roberts, T.M. Weerasinghe (Penda), Major L.V. Gooneratne (Nutta), J.E.V.Pieris, affectionately “Bada”, R.E. ’Bob’ Edwards et al.

As his eldest son, the late Capt. A.J.B. Anghie (Tony) once confided in this writer his father did not come to Royal alone. He came over with the SPC ground boy, later to mature as the RC groundsman so familiar to us in our day as the legendary and inimitable David, whose deeds, dedication and the very effective and humorous patois of spoken English must surely be far too familiar to Royalists of our generation.

BCA taught in class while getting thoroughly involved in activities outside the classroom as well. Royal College Magazines of the relevant time display the type of activities undertaken by him. He had been one of the House Masters overseeing the activities of Hartley House; Master in Charge (MIC) and later coach of Royal rugby First XV; MIC of Swimming as well as Boxing.

He had also performed the duties as the Careers Master responsible for overseeing and guiding the future prospects and hopes of young Royalists in whatever field they wanted to further themselves. The vast array of contacts he had cultivated over the years with influential people had helped him to seek advice and assistance in finding niches for his students wanting to further their careers. As a Cadet Officer BCA became a Company Commander and eventually a Major and Second- in-Command of a Battalion in the Cadet Corps.

Yet, it was as the MIC and later coach of the Royal Rugby team that he had really made his mark early. Ever since the Royal-Trinity rugby series commenced in 1920 Royal had never been able to taste victory against their traditional rivals until BCA took over not only as MIC but later as coach as well when L. Mc D Robison who was helping the team in 1941 had gone on promotion. The credit for Royal’s first ever victory vs Trinity must go to the 1941 Royal Team led by Minoo Jilla as well as to Mr. Mc D Robison and BCA for his stewardship as MIC and later coach of that team.

Yet, the most challenging job accomplished by BCA was perhaps his undertaking to revive the RC Hostel which had to be closed down during the Second WW years. This he did with singular purpose to get the Hostel back in place before he handed the duties over to his successor Mr. Cecil Belleth in 1952.

BCA was showered with undiluted praise by two of Royal’s finest sportsmen, viz , Summa Navaratnam (SN) and Wijaya ‘Stanley’ Unamboowe`(WSU). While Navaratnam praised BCA’s dedication on and off the field more particularly on the field as MIC and coach of Royal rugby, Unamboowe, who had been a hosteler spoke, in addition, lovingly, of the endearing care with which Mrs. Alicia Anghie, BCA’s dear wife, looked after the hostelers, playing an exemplary role of a caring foster mother!

In a farewell note on BCA, the RC Magazine (Dec 1952 edited by G.A. Perera and G.A. Iriyagolla) records that Royal owes indeed a debt of gratitude for the sterling work done by him at Royal. “There may not be a special panel for Mr. Anghie’s name, but we are not likely to forget him”.

BCA’s last stint as the MIC and coach of Royal rugby was in the inaugural Bradby Shield games in 1945. RC magazine of 1945 records a full appreciation of his services thus: “we thank Mr. B.C. Anghie for his experienced and efficient coaching” as recorded that year by Mahes Rodrigo, Secretary and vice-captain of the Royal College Rugby Football Club (RCRFC as it was then known) . The RC Games Council and the corresponding body at SPC coalesced in a supreme gesture to fittingly to honour him by the award of the B.C. Anghie Trophy for the annual Royal v SPC rugby encounter. The authorities of both at Royal and SPC could not have found a better way of paying a fitting tribute to a great and dedicated school master.

By the time BCA left Royal, end of the second Term of 1952, to take up an appointment as Asst. Registrar of the then nascent University of Ceylon, his eldest son, Tony had already left for the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. When Tony obtained a First Division at the Senior School Certificate Examination (the equivalent of today’s ‘O’ Levels), obtaining distinctions in Latin, English Literature and English language, his father had other ideas about higher studies for him. However, Tony had decided to follow a career in the military.

Tony won his College Colours at Cricket, Rugby and Boxing, which latter sport he also captained. It was very unfortunate that Tony got arraigned as a suspect in the 1962 Coup Case. However, he was discharged early in the course of the Coup Trial-at-Bar (holden in 1963), comprising the Hon. Supreme Court Judges , M.C. Sansoni, H.N.G.Fernando and L.B. de Silva. (Vide Report by D.B.S Jeyaraj Daily Mirror 15 Jan2022).

Perhaps his only fault was that he happened to be serving in the same Regiment under Col F.C. de Saram, the cricketing genius, who took the major responsibility for organizing the abortive coup of 1962. On being discharged Tony led a fruitful life, immersed, inter alia, in classical music and drama and on his return from Australia, whither he had emigrated, got himself fully involved in the activities of the Royal College Union (RCU) as a Vice-President , the Old Royalists’ Rugby Dinner (The ORRD)Committee as well as the Cancer Society of Sri Lanka with relentless dedication.

Trevor Anghie, the second of the three Anghie brothers won College Colours at Rugby, Athletics, Boxing, and Tennis, captaining the Royal Rugby team in1950. While indulging in sports activities, he fulfilled his parents’ dream and qualified as a doctor. After his internship he practiced his profession in Bandarawela and Welimada along with Dr. Ken Rajendra before he emigrated to Australia. Trevor represented the CR & FC, UVA Rugby Club, Havelocks SC, Ceylon and Ceylon Barbarians at Rugby. He settled in Malvern Melbourne, Australia as a well-accepted general practitioner for well over 30 years.

At RC both brothers Tony and Trevor won the much-coveted  Donhorst Prize in 1949 and 1951 respectively, awarded for General Merit, only the third set of brothers to win the coveted prize after the Keuneman brothers (Pieter in 1935 and A.E in 1938 ; the Amerasinghe brothers , Upali in 1946 and Asoka. In 1952. (Later the Dharmaratne brothers Dinesh in 1994 and Yasas in 1995 won the Donhorst).The Donhorst was first awarded in1930 and the first winner was Col. F.C. de Saram. .

Maurice Anghie the youngest of the brothers and the youngest of all the Anghie siblings was no mean sportsman either. He represented the Royal Primary School (RPS), then a separate entity from Royal College proper, at cricket, captained the RPS football team in 1952 and represented RPS at athletics as well whilst also being appointed a prefect He was awarded the Best All-Round Boy’s Prize of RPS in 1952 before he entered RC in 1953.

At RC proper Maurice became probably the youngest player (at 14 plus) to represent the RC First XV at Rugby in 1956 under Lionel Almeida’s captaincy, eventually captaining the team in 1959. Though he played cricket at the junior level and also represented the school at athletics, he focused more on rugby. On leaving school, though he could have represented RC for two more years, he went on to represent the Havelocks and eventually Ceylon before business interests impelled him to move to Hong Kong, but not before doing business in Ceylon with his cousin David Gyi, who ran the Chopsticks Restaurant in the Fort and also with American Lloyd, in the travel business with his friend Rajan Phillips.

Maurice eventually settled into a lucrative career as a professional accountant in Perth Australia. His role as captain of the Royal First XV in 1959 amply enabled him to display his leadership qualities. Playing in the front row under his captaincy, ensconced by two fantastic props forwards in Chulaka de Zoysa (loose head) and the tough and burly Lalith de Silva (tight head), was a privilege indeed!

In the game against Zahira that year played at Longden Place Maurice displayed his superlative leadership qualities when he led his `team to victory in a do or die battle, leading from the front with only 12 brave men for a greater part of the game when the then rules did not permit replacements. Coincidentally in 1959 Maurice’s rival skipper in the game vs SPC was his own first cousin, Adiel, son of BCA’s brother Gerry A).

The Anghies are no more, including their only sister Maureen, who moved on while still a medical student, succumbing to a terminal illness. They had been very much an integral part of Royal for 16 eventful years. This writer had the privilege of knowing and interacting with all the Anghie siblings, including Maureen, who visited our home to meet her schoolmate at St. Bridget’s and medical batch mate, who was residing with us during her medical student days.

The Anghies must surely be reaping just reward in their new Abode, echoing ,individually and collectively, from their vantage point:  That corner of the earth pleases me more than any other!, reminiscing on their integral days at the dear old school!

Come 27 July 2024, the honored Chief Guest at the Royal vs SPC game will be Professor Dr. Antony Anghie, grandson of Mr. B.C. Anghie and the son of late Capt. Tony Anghie-ULK
