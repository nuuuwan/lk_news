RIOCOCO Lanka earned dual silver honours at Stevie American Business Awards 2024

RIOCOCO, one of the major coconut-growing media manufacturers in Sri Lanka, was awarded two prestigious Silver Awards at the Annual Stevie Awards also known as the American Business Awards 2024 recently. RIOCOCO was recognised for its excellence as the Manufacturing Company of the Year and for its cutting-edge contributions in Sustainability and Climate Protection products, said a press release.

Established in 2004, RIOCOCO began with a vision to revolutionise the coconut growing media industry with the corporate headquarters in Texas, USA. Founded by Shan Halamba, the company quickly gained prominence for its commitment to producing high-quality, uniform, and consistent coconut growing media for medium to high tech greenhouses. Over the years, RIOCOCO has expanded its operations to over 65 countries worldwide, becoming a global leader and the Sri Lankan origin brand in the industry.

Teesha Perera, Vice President of RIOCOCO, who received the awards at the ceremony held in Marriot Marquee Hotel in New York said: “It’s an honour to receive these prestigious awards. We feel that we did something really great. That’s why we won these awards. This achievement will be motivating us to work more harder to achieve gold awards. We received silver awards this year, and our next hope is for gold awards. I would like to thank our teams in Sri Lanka and the US, and our clients all around the world. It is they who are behind all these achievements.”
