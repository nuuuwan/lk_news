Sri Lanka to review Adani wind power plant after polls

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will review a wind power plant promoted by India’s Adani group after elections, as no policy decisions will be taken on projects in the transition period, Foreign Minister Vjitha Herath said.

Sri Lanka will have to look at the pros and cons of the agreement where a special problem was the high unit price of the electricity, he said.

Sri Lanka approved a negotiated a feed in tarrif of 8.26 cents per unit for the Adani wind plant in Mannar, which was sharply higher than other renewable plants which came on competitive tender.

“We will not take any decision in the interim period,” Minister Herath told a post-cabinet press briefing.

“On that we will have to act after the new government is in place. There are some information by the Public Utility Commission, there is a court case, there are views by CEB officials.”

Sri Lanka had discussed strengthening economic ties with India during a visit by External Affairs Minister S Jayshankar but not specific projects, he said. (Colombo/Oct07/2024)
