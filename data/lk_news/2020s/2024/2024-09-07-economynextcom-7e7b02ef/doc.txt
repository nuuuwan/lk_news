Sri Lanka Customs records Rs1tn revenue

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka Customs, a chief government revenue collection department, has said that it brought in 1 trillion rupees so far this year, in a first.

Director General of Customs Sarath Nonis was quoted saying he was confident that the IMF revenue target of 1,534 billion rupees for 2024 can be achieved within the next four months of the year, according to a statement by the President’s media division.

The department’s previous highest revenue was 975 billion rupees in 2023.

Typically, 25%-30% of total customs revenue comes from car imports, Nonis pointed out, but this figure has dropped below 6% due to restrictions on car imports in both years.

The Director General credited “the opportunity given to the administrative authority and officials to operate independently without external interference” and “the new operational methods and technical processes implemented over the past two years”.

The department was “able to streamline operations through new methods and advanced technical processes”.

Sri Lanka Customs also opened internal affairs unit to receive and investigate public complaints.
