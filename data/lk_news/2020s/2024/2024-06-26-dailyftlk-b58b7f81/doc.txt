CEB seeks new service provider for Thambapawani wind power plant maintenance

Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved initiating a competitive procurement process by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) for selecting a new service provider to ensure the continued efficient operation and maintenance of the Thambapawani Wind Power Plant.

The Thambapawani Wind Power Plant, a significant contributor to country’s renewable energy sector, was under commercial monitoring since 18 May 2021. The CEB had previously contracted Vestas Wind Lanka Ltd., for a three-year period, which concluded on 17 May 2024.

The selection process aims to secure a provider capable of upholding these standards and supporting the plant’s long-term operational goals.

The proposal to this effect submitted by the Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
