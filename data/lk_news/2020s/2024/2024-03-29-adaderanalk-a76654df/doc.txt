New Electricity Reforms Bill to be gazetted in 2 weeks

The new Bill on electricity sector reforms will be gazetted in the next two weeks, Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera said.

Subsequently, the new bill will be presented to the Parliament during the last week of April, according to the Minister.

Taking to X (formerly Twitter) to announce this, Wijesekera stated that after reviewing, the certification to proceed with the new draft bill was issued by the Attorney General last Monday.

Thus, the Energy Minister highlighted that the stakeholders or any interested individuals will have at least two weeks to review the gazetted Bill and two more weeks from the day of presentation to the Parliament to challenge the Bill’s legality.

The suggestions and issues raised by the development agencies and stakeholders have been incorporated as amendments to the draft Bill that was gazetted in December by the Legal Draftsman’s Department and the inconsistencies in the Sinhala and Tamil translations were also fixed, Wijesekera added.

The progress of the electricity sector reforms was reviewed by Wijesekera at the Ministry of Power and Energy with the officials of the Reforms Secretariat on Thursday (28).
