Heartwarming visit to care home residents

Delighted care home residents were treated to an unforgettable meet-and-greet - when two penguins waddled through the door. Pensioners took turns to give Humboldt penguins, Widget and Pringle, a hug or even a pamper in the sink under the tap. The unexpected visitors at Brendoncare St Giles View, in Winchester, took it all in stride. They even used the lift to move between meeting members of the team, residents and their relatives. They were supplied by company Amazing Animals. (Daily Mail)
