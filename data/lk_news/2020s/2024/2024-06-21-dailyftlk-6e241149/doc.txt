Water Supply and Plantation Infrastructure Development Ministry has announced plans to hold a youth conference as part of the national program commemorating the 200th anniversary of the plantation community’s arrival in Sri Lanka.

The summit, titled ‘Youth Aruna’ aims to engage young people in meaningful discussions and activities related to the plantation community’s history and future. The conference is scheduled for 22 June, at the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT) in Kandy. Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development Ministry is leading the conference, in collaboration with the University of Peradeniya, SLIIT, university students and AIESEC voluntary organisations. The National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (NCCSL) has also agreed to host a job fair concurrently with the conference.

The initiative is designed to provide employment opportunities and career guidance to the youth attending the event.

Ministerial submissions regarding this event were reviewed and considered by the Cabinet of Ministers on Wednesday, indicating strong Governmental support for this significant occasion.

“Youth Aruna represents a unique opportunity for young people to connect with their heritage, gain insights into the plantation community’s contributions, and explore future prospects in various industries,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said yesterday.

The event is expected to draw considerable participation and foster a sense of unity and progress among the youth of Sri Lanka.
