Sri Lanka president asks new owners not to mortgage, sell houses

ECONOMYNEXT – President Ranil Wickremesinghe has asked new house owners to not mortgage property, at a ceremony to handover flats to those who lost houses in the Kajimawatte fire.

“This house you get today will become your most valuable property. It is your responsibility to use it safely. Do not mortgage or sell these houses after suffering for the last ten years. I request you to protect these houses like your own life,” Wickremesinghe said.

294 houses at the Randiya Uyana housing complex in Modara were handed over to people from Kajimawatte whose houses were gutted by a fire in 2010.

“The people of Kajimawatte have been living in a place like hell. It is impossible to imagine how they lived there.” (Colombo/Apr10/2024)
