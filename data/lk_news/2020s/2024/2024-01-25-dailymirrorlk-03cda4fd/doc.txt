US concerned over potential impact of Sri Lanka’s Online Safety Bill: Julie Chung

Colombo, Jan. 25 (Daily Mirror)- The United States remains concerned over the potential impact of Sri Lanka’s Online Safety Bill, which was passed yesterday without incorporating important inputs from key stakeholders, including civil society and tech companies who say that this legislation threatens freedom of expression, innovation and privacy, US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung said.

"In addition to jeopardizing democratic values, vague and overly restrictive legislation can hinder investments and the development of a digital economy, undermining the economic growth that Sri Lanka needs. The US urges Sri Lanka to prioritize transparency and ensure any legislation does not stifle the voices of its people," she tweeted.
