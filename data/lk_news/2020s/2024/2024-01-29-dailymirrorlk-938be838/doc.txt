President’s Counsel is a professional rank and status conferred to the appointee by the President under Article 33 (cc) of the Constitution. According to the constitutional provision, attorneys-at-law who have reached eminence in the profession and have maintained high standards of conduct and professional rectitude are appointed as President’s Counsel by the President.

The Constitution states every President’s Counsel appointed under this provision shall be entitled to all privileges as were hitherto enjoyed by a Queen’s Counsel.
