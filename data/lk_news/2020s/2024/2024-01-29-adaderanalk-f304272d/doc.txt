Colombo Port sees surge in ship arrivals due to Red Sea crisis

Sri Lankaâ€™s Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva has stated that the recent increase in the number of ship arrivals at the Colombo Port is likely due to the Red Sea crisis.

Accordingly, the Minister revealed that the number of ships docking at the Colombo Port has increased by 35% within the month of January, while container operations at the port have also increased by 72%.

Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva made these remarks while attending a special inspection of the Jaya Container Terminal (JCT) of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA).

Commenting on the increase in ship arrivals recorded at the Colombo Port, however, State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya claimed that he remains dissatisfied that this increase is likely attributed to the Red Sea crisis.
