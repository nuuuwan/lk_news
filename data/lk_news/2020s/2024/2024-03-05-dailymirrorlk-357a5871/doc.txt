CPC has failed to provide quality standard report for Super Diesel: Gemunu

Colombo, March 5 (Daily Mirror) - The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) has failed to provide a quality standard report for its Super Diesel stocks currently used by buses and other diesel vehicle owners, Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) president Gemunu Wijeratne said.

Addressing the media, he said that his association has received many complaints regarding the quality standards of the super diesel stocks.

Most complaints from vehicle users claimed that they are unable to get the maximum fuel efficiency and that they cannot drive their vehicles to the maximum kilometres per litre.

"As a responsible association, I informed the CPC officials in this regard, but they are still unable to provide a quality standard report for me," he said.
