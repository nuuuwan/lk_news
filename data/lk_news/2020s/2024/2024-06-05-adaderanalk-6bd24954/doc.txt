Dambulla LPL franchise gets new owner, to be named ‘Dambulla Sixers’

Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) today announced that Sequoia Consultants, Inc., a leading civil engineering consulting firm based in Los Angeles, California, has come forward to take over the future of the LPL team, Dambulla.

The team will be operated under DeSilva Holdings, specifically setup for this purpose.

The majority stake in Sequoia Consultants is owned by Mr. Priyanga De Silva, a Chartered Civil Engineer, who is the CEO and President of Sequoia Consultants, Inc, said SLC in a statement.

De Silva, a former first-class cricketer, played for Sri Lanka U19 in 1983 and currently represents the United States Masters Over 60 Cricket Team.

He also volunteers his time as head coach of the not-for-profit Southern California Youth Cricket Association and owns several other businesses in the USA and Sri Lanka.

“My desire to get engaged in cricket, especially cricket in Sri Lanka, prompted me to purchase the Dambulla Sixers team,” said De Silva.

“I have seen LPL grow as a league during the last four years, which is commendable for a small country like ours. I am excited to be a part of this growth and be able to contribute to the development of cricket in our country,” he further added.

With the new buyer, the team will be known as “Dambulla Sixers’.

“We are extremely happy to have the new owner taking over Dambulla, and Mr. De Silva’s background as a former first-class cricketer definitely adds value to this ownership, as he understands the cricketing pulse of our nation, said Mr. Samantha Dodanwela, Tournament Director of the LPL.

“The new owner brings in the required stability for the Dambulla Sixers, and I am sure the new owner’s presence is going to make a huge difference to the franchise,” said Anil Mohan, CEO and Founder of IPG Sports.

Meanwhile, the fifth edition of the Lanka Premier League is scheduled to start on July 1 and will be played in three cities: Kandy, Dambulla, and Colombo.
