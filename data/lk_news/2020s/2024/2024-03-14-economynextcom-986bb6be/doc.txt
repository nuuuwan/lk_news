Sri Lanka consumer confidence improves in February: survey

ECONOMYNEXT — All indices of consumer confidence run by the Institute for Health Policy (IHP), an independent research institute in Sri Lanka, improved in February.

The institute said in a statement its Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS), the broadest measure of the public’s view of their personal economic status and the national economy gained 6 points to 22 points. The Index of Consumer Expectations (ICE), which tracks future perceptions increased 7 points to 28 points. The Index of Current Conditions (ICC), a measure of perceptions of current conditions, also increased 4 points to 13 points.

“Indices were boosted by a recovery in public expectations of the country’s situation in the next 12 months and the recovery of buying conditions,” the IHP said.

All IHP Sri Lanka Opinion Tracker Survey (SLOTS) consumer confidence indices range from zero to a potential maximum of 100, with levels below 50 indicating net pessimism.

The CCI estimates are based on 15,469 interviews conducted between Oct. 21, 2021– March 07, 2024, including 579 interviews conducted in February 2024, with sample sizes varying between indices depending on response rates. All estimates are adjusted to be representative of the national population, including gender, age, ethnicity, and income level, the institute said.

The SLOTS platform tracks public opinion and well-being daily using a large national panel recruited by face-to-face interviews and other randomly dialled respondents, with numerous peer-reviewed scientific publications that use the data, the statement said. (Colombo/Mar14/2024)
