UN addresses concern over deployment of HR violators in peacekeeping missions

UN Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric emphasises Secretariat’s commitment to deploying personnel who meet the highest standards integrity, including commitment to human rights

Acknowledges there have been instances where allegations of past HR violations by uniformed personnel were brought to UN’s attention

Ensures in such cases, UN peacekeeping department takes appropriate action following their screening policy and other relevant frameworks

In a recent UN news briefing, questions were raised about a recent investigative documentary revealing that Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have allegedly sent officers implicated in severe human rights violations, including torture and extrajudicial killings, on UN peacekeeping missions. Concerns at the briefing held on 22 May were specifically highlighted regarding the deployment of numerous human rights abusers from Bangladesh.

In response UN Spoke-sperson Stephane Dujarric confirmed that the UN is aware of the documentary. “Yes, we’ve seen the documentary and as you know, our colleagues in the peacekeeping department have been interacting and gave a statement to the producers,” Dujarric said. He emphasised the Secretariat’s commitment to deploying personnel that meet the highest standards of efficiency and integrity, including respect for and commitment to human rights.

Dujarric detailed the established procedures and mechanisms under the policy on human rights screening of UN personnel. He explained that the screening process involves three parts: self-certification by the personnel, certification by the sending country, and a procedure managed by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.

He acknowledged that over the years, there have been instances where allegations of past human rights violations committed by uniformed personnel from a few countries were brought to the UN’s attention. He said in such cases, the peacekeeping department takes appropriate action following their screening policy and other relevant frameworks.

“This process often involves consultation with troop-contributing countries and can result in the non-deployment or repatriation of the implicated personnel if allegations are substantiated,” he noted.

“The Secretariat is committed to deploying personnel that meet the highest standards of efficiency and integrity, including respect for and commitment to human rights,” Dujarric reiterated, underscoring the UN’s dedication to maintaining the integrity of its peacekeeping missions.
