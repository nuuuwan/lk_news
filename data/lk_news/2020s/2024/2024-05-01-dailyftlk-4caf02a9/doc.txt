The Swami Vivekananda Cultural Centre, cultural arm of the High Commission of India, Colombo, commemorated the 75th Foundation Day of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) at the Viharamahadevi Park Open Air Theatre in Colombo on Monday.

The event unfolded with a vibrant showcase of Indian classical dances and musical performances, painting a tapestry of cultural harmony and universality.

Indian High Commissioner Santosh Jha was joined by Education Minister Dr. Susil Premajayantha as the Chief Guest and Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs Minister Vidura Wickramanayaka as the Guest of Honour in inaugurating the event.

High Commissioner Jha in his address congratulated the ICCR family for being the pillar of India’s cultural diplomacy for 75 years and counting. Minister Premajayantha thanked ICCR for offering over 200 fully-funded scholarships annually for Sri Lankan students to pursue Under Graduate, Post Graduate and doctoral degrees in diverse subjects in more than 120 leading universities and institutions of India.

On this occasion, winners of the second edition of the Pratibha Sangam competitions were felicitated. An initiative of ICCR to commemorate 75 years of Indian independence, Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav, Pratibha Sangam (Confluence of Cultures) shines spotlight on the invaluable contributions of foreign nationals and overseas Indians to Indian classical art forms.

ICCR was founded in 1950 by India’s first Education Minister, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. The 75th Foundation Day of ICCR holds immense significance as it commemorates 75 glorious years of an institution that has been at the forefront of India’s cultural ties, fostering understanding, goodwill, and cooperation between India and the world. The ICCR centre in Sri Lanka, Swami Vivekananda Cultural Centre under the aegis of High Commission of India has also completed 25 Years. Established as a testament to the enduring friendship between India and Sri Lanka, the Centre serves as a hub for cultural exchange, appreciation, and dialogue.
