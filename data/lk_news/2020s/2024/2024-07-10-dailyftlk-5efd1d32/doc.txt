LAUGFS Rubber recently received a Gold Award at the National Convention on Quality and Productivity (NCQP) Awards 2024.

Adding to the significance of the achievement, this is the first award received by its non-executive staff in this competition.

LAUGFS Rubber said the achievement reflects the company’s commitment to excellence and its dedication to cultivating a culture of quality and productivity amongst its teams. The achievement not only brings national recognition to the LAUGFS Group but also highlights the potential and capability of Sri Lankan enterprises in the global arena.

The prestigious NCQP Awards 2024, organised by the Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Quality and Productivity (SLAAQP), was held at the Mount Lavinia Hotel recently. It brought together industry leaders, professionals, and innovators to discuss and celebrate advancements in quality and productivity. Held under the theme “A Quest for Quality, Productivity, and Innovation” this year, one of the highlights of the NCQP 2024 was the Quality Circle competition, which showcased the efforts of non-executive employees from various reputed organisations to enhance productivity. It was in this event that the team from LAUGFS Rubber earned their Gold Award, securing them an opportunity to represent Sri Lanka at the upcoming International Convention on Quality Control Circles (ICQCC) 2024, a global event.

LAUGFS Rubber CEO Chinthaka Wegapitiya said: “We are incredibly honoured to receive this award, and I wish to congratulate our team. Winning the gold award at the NCQP 2024 represents the hard work and dedication of our shop floor teams. This accolade not only recognises their efforts but also sets a benchmark for quality and productivity within the industry. We are excited to represent Sri Lanka at the ICQCC 2024 and showcase our commitment to excellence on an international stage. I take this opportunity to appreciate the commitment and hard work that our teams put in every day in our quest to achieve exceptional excellence.”

The ICQCC will be hosted in Sri Lanka in November 2024 and will provide a global platform for showcasing Sri Lanka’s advancements in quality control and productivity, with LAUGFS Rubber being amongst the leaders. Representing Sri Lankan enterprises, the LAUGFS Rubber team is ready to showcase its expertise and share its success story at this much-anticipated international forum. As it emerges victorious at the NCQP 2024, LAUGFS Rubber remains dedicated to maintaining the highest standards for quality and excellence.
