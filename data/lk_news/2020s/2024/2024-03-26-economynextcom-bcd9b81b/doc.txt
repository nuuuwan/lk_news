Sri Lanka CB chief sees end-March FX reserves at “much higher than $4.5 bln”

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s end-march foreign exchange reserves will be much higher than the end February number as the central bank has been heavily buying US dollars from the market, the Central Bank Governor said.

The Gross official reserves improved to $4.5 billion by end February 2024 including a $1.4 billion swap facility from the People’s Bank of China.

The central bank has been buying reserves with excess dollar inflows into the market in the absence of dampened imports and due to the non-repayment of external debts.

“I can say we have been purchasing heavily from the market,” Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe told reporters at a media briefing on Tuesday (26) after announcement of 50 basis point reduction in the key monetary policy rates.

“That should be much higher than $4.5 billion,” he said referring to the end-March reserves.

Currency dealers said the rupee would he appreciated further if not for the central bank buying.

The Sri Lanka rupee has appreciated by 6.7 percent against the US dollar so far this year, following a 12.1 percent gain last year.

The reserves fell as low as to less than $5oo million in the latter part of 2021 amid a looming economic and debt crisis. (Colombo/Marc 26/2024)
