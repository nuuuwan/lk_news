Civil organization demands a 33% electricity tariff revision

Colombo, Feb 14 (Daily Mirror) - The National Front of Civil Organizations (NFCO) today requested electricity consumers to gather in front of the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) premises to express opposition to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), which is set to finalize the collection of public opinions for the upcoming electricity tariff revision, NFCO president Priyantha Thilakarathna said.

Addressing the media, he said that the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) had raised the electricity tariff without taking into account public opinions. He claimed that the decision seemed to align more with the preferences of the Power and Energy Ministry and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).

Therefore, the NFCO has decided to launch a silent protest in front of the BMICH tomorrow morning.

"The country's cost of living is far higher compared to other countries; the government does not consider people's difficulties in its decision to increase the electricity tariff," Thilakarathna said.

He claimed that Minister Kanchana Wijesekera had decided to reduce the electricity tariff by three percent. But as far as they know, the electricity tariff can be reduced by up to 33 percent. The Minister is always trying to ignore the voice of the people and increase the electricity tariff without providing any relief.

The NFCO claimed that the electricity tariff is being increased according to the request of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
