The Palm Oil Industry Association (POIA) has extended its warmest congratulations to the newly elected Government on its resounding victory in the recent General Election.

“This remarkable achievement reflects the trust and confidence placed in the NPP by the people of Sri Lanka. We recognise the vital role that the Government plays in shaping policies that affect the agriculture and industrial sectors, including the palm oil industry. Under the leadership of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, we are confident of fostering an environment that supports sustainable agriculture practices, innovation, and growth within the agriculture industry,” POIA said in a statement.

The Association also extended its congratulations and best wishes to the newly elected Minister of Plantation and Community Infrastructure Samanatha Vidyarathna, in his new role to reap the full potential of the plantation sector.

“The palm oil sector is crucial to Sri Lanka’s economy, providing livelihoods for rural communities, promoting food security and contributing towards poverty alleviation. We are eager to collaborate with the new Government to address the challenges and opportunities ahead and to promote the sustainability of the palm oil industry which is a thriving industry especially in South Asia.

“We look forward to engaging with the new administration and working together to ensure that the palm oil industry thrives in a manner that is beneficial for all stakeholders. Once again, our sincere congratulations to the new Government. The POIA wishes the new Government every success in charting a new course for our nation,” the statement added.
