Cabinet nod for admission of local students to medical degree programme at KDU

The Cabinet of Ministers has granted approval for the admission of local students for the MBBS medical degree programme at General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University starting from this year.

The admissions will be carried out on payment basis and based on ‘Z’ score at G.C.E. Advanced Level and other specified qualifications, the Cabinet Spokesman Minister Bandula Gunawardena said.

The General Sir John Kotalawala Defense University (KDU) was declared a University by the General Sir John Kotalawala State Defense Training Institute (Amendment) Act No. 27 of 1988.

Meanwhile, the Faculty of Medicine of the university was established in the year 2011 to train cadet officers as medical professionals and award degrees in Medicine and Surgery (MBBS) as per the service requirements of the Armed Services.

Accordingly, the university currently grants the opportunity to pursue medical degrees for local students who join the armed forces or police as a cadet and qualified foreign students only, on a payment basis.

The proposal to allow the admission of local students selected through a set of criteria, for the MBBS medical degree programme at the university under a payment basis, was presented to the Cabinet of Ministers by President Ranil Wickremesinghe.
