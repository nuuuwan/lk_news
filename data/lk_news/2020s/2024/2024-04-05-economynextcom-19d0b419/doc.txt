Sri Lanka’s SJB welcomes SLPP dissidents, heaps praise on G L Peiris

ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka’s main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has welcomed some of the most prominent members of the former Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) government headed by ousted ex president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, with the SJB general secretary particularly heaping praise on MP G L Peiris.

SJB parliamentarian Ranjith Madduma Bandara speaking at a ceremony to mark the alliance between his party and the Freedom People’s Congress headed by Peiris said the latter’s partnership was a “great strength” to the SJB.

“G L Peiris and the team have become a great strength to us today. He has joined us with his team, bringing in his economic vision, his knowledge, and his political experience,” said Bandara.

The MP claimed that a majority of Sri Lankans have already decided that only the SJB can save the country.

“Other parties that love the country, want to develop it, and think about the future generations of this country have decided to partner with the SJB,” he said.

The new alliance will be called the Samagi Jana Alliance, he said.

The other MPs who joined the alliance on Friday April 05 are SLPP MPs Dilan Perera, Nalaka Godahewa, Upul Galappaththi, Wasantha Yapa Bandara and K P S Kumarasiri .

The six MPs have signed a memorandum of understanding with the SJB.

Both the SJB and President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s United National Party (UNP) have alluded to coming crossovers to each other.

UNP parliamentarian Vajira Abeywardena said: “Let’s see what alliances there are after May.”

Referring to speculation that the presidential election may not be held this year, he said: “Because the opposition has nothing else to say, they’re using this as a slogan. When this year began, the president said clearly that the presidential election will be held before October 17.” (Colombo/Apr05/2024)
