US Embassy Colombo achieves LEED Gold Certification

Milestone as Sri Lanka’s 50th Gold Certified Building ahead of World Energy Conservation Day

US Embassy Colombo yesterday announced the achievement of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification, becoming the 50th building in Sri Lanka to earn this globally recognised symbol of sustainability achievement.

The US Green Building Council’s LEED green building program recognises energy efficiency, water management, waste reduction, and indoor environmental quality execution in the built environment.

This milestone demonstrates the United States’ commitment to sustainability and climate resiliency in practice, the Embassy’s commitment to environmental stewardship, and respect for Sri Lanka’s ecology, history, and culture.

To commemorate this accomplishment and in anticipation of World Energy Conservation Day on 14 December, US Ambassador Julie Chung recently met with Sri Lanka’s Minister of Environment Dr. Dhammika Patabendi and Minister of Energy Kumara Jayakody to discuss the Embassy’s state-of-the-art facilities. The Ambassador emphasised the building’s innovative energy-efficient design, the integration of local elements, and the importance of sustainable practices in addressing global environmental challenges.

“Achieving LEED Gold certification is a significant step in demonstrating our shared commitment to sustainability,” said US Ambassador Julie Chung. “This building is more than an Embassy — it’s a symbol of how thoughtful design and green practices can protect our environment while honouring Sri Lanka’s cultural and natural heritage. We are proud to stand as the 50th LEED Gold certified building in the country, contributing to Sri Lanka’s greener future.”

Minister Patabendi said: “The U.S. Embassy achieving LEED Gold certification is a significant milestone in sustainable infrastructure development. This building exemplifies innovative design, energy efficiency, and respect for our local environment through the use of native plants and integration of local artistry. It sets a benchmark for future projects and highlights the positive impact of international collaboration in advancing sustainability goals in Sri Lanka. It reflects the strong partnership between the United States and Sri Lanka and demonstrates how thoughtful design can benefit both the environment and the community.”

The US Government overseas diplomatic and consular property portfolio, managed by the US Department of State Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO), mandates LEED Silver certification for the construction of new facilities. US Embassy Colombo joins 63 US diplomatic missions worldwide that have achieved LEED certification, of which 23 are certified Gold, 17 of which were the first LEED certification in the country.

The system efficiently supplies power to the building’s distribution network, and when production exceeds the Embassy’s consumption needs, the surplus energy is fed back into the surrounding city power grid
