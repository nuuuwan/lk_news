Five students of Jaffna Uni. arrested during protest march

Five students of the University of Jaffna were arrested in the Kilinochchi area on Sunday (04 Feb.), for blocking the main road while staging a protest march.

The protest march was staged over several concerns, including the failure to resolve not only those issues faced by the people of the North and East, but also those currently faced by the public and the adoption of laws that pose a threat to both, the freedom of expression and that of the media.

Several representatives of political parties, including the leader of the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) S. Sritharan and MP Charles Nirmalanathan, also participated in the protest march, Ada Derana learns.
