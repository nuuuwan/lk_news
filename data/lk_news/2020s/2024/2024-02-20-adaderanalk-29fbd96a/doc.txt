In response to growing concerns over the protection and welfare of children in Sri Lanka, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved a proposal calling for the preparation of the composite draft bill on child rights.

The relevant proposal was submitted by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his capacity as the Minister of Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment.

Accordingly, the Legal Draftsman will be directed to prepare the composite act, enshrining the rights declared in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, in addition to the existing legal provisions pertaining to the protection of child rights, a statement said.
