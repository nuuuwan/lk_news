Sri Lanka, India forge partnership for economic prosperity through capacity building initiative

A high-level Sri Lankan delegation has embarked on an official visit to India to gain insights into the neighbour’s recent initiatives for transforming its public service qualitatively and implementing policy improvements successfully.

During their stay from 12-17 February, the 14-member delegation, led by Prime Minister’s Secretary Anura Dissanayake, will seek to prioritize capacity development in Sri Lankan government institutions contributing to the nation’s economic growth.

The President’s Media Division (PMD) said the delegates are expected to engage in extensive discussions with Indian institutions. The program, scheduled to be conducted at India’s National Centre for Good Governance, will cover various aspects such as digitalization, capacity development, anti-corruption measures, and investment facilitation.

They will also meet with key Indian officials including the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of State for Personnel, and the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister to explore avenues for further collaboration.

This capacity building initiative marks a significant step towards realizing the shared goals of economic prosperity and sustainable development between Sri Lanka and India, the PMD added, noting that it reflects the commitment of both nations to harnessing their collective potential for mutual benefit and regional stability.

This initiative stems from the deliberations between Bharat Lal, the Director General of India’s National Centre for Good Governance, and senior Sri Lankan officials, including President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena.
