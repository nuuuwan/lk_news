Sri Lanka water tariff cut of up to 10-pct under formula: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet has given approval to cut household water tariffs up to 10 percent under a cost reflective tariff formula, Minister Bandula Gunawardana said.

“Low income domestic users will get a reduction of about 10 percent,” Gunawardena told reporters.

“For the other categories it will be a reduction of about 5.9 percent and 6 percent.”

Domestic users will see water tariffs reduced by 7 percent, government hospitals reduced by 4.5 percent, and schools and places of religious worship by 6.3 percent.

Water Supply and Drainage Board has seen costs reduce due to recent reductions in electricity and fuel prices, he said. Chemicals costs and interest rate drops were also considered.
