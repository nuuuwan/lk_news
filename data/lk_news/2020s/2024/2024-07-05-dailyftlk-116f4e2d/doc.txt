The National Convention on Quality and Productivity (NCQP) 2024, organised by the Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Quality and Productivity (SLAAQP), concluded successfully on 24 June at the Mount Lavinia Hotel, Colombo.

Held under the theme “A Quest for Quality, Productivity, and Innovation,” the event highlighted Sri Lanka’s dedication to excellence across diverse sectors.

The convention attracted over 360 teams mostly from the manufacturing industry, presenting their achievements in Quality Control Circles, Cross-Functional Teams, Lean Six Sigma, Quality Improvement Projects, and Kaizen suggestions. A panel of expert judges evaluated the presentations, recognising outstanding contributions through an awards ceremony.

Among the esteemed Gold winners were CBL, MAS, and Ansell Lanka, Uni Dil Packaging, Hemas Hospitals, Melsta Hospitals, Lanka Hospitals and Elastomeric Engineering demonstrating Sri Lanka’s commitment to achieving the highest standards in quality and innovation. These Gold award recipients have earned the prestigious opportunity to represent Sri Lanka at the International Convention on Quality Control Circles (ICQCC) 2024, to be hosted in Sri Lanka this November.

In total, a remarkable 340 teams from 78 companies achieved Gold awards across the three major categories. The event acknowledged a total of 344 awards, encompassing Gold, Silver, and Bronze categories.

The event featured distinguished speakers, including Quality Circle Forum of India Executive Director D.K. Srivastava as the Chief Guest and Sri Lanka Standards Institution Deputy Director General Samanthi Narangoda as the Keynote Speaker for the first session.

The second session was graced by Industry Development Board Sri Lanka Chairman Dr. Saranga Alahapperuma as Chief Guest, and University of Moratuwa Senior Lecturer in the Department of Transport and Logistics Dr. Ranil Sugathadasa, as Keynote Speaker and SLAAQP Founder President Sunil Wijesinghe attended as the Guest of honour.

A highlight of NCQP 2024 was the strong emphasis on sustainability. Many teams demonstrated how their quality improvement initiatives contribute to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and address climate action through waste reduction, resource optimisation, and minimising environmental impact.

CBL Foods International (Platinum Sponsor) Chief Operating Officer Kamal Geeganage and Ansell Lanka and Ansell Textiles (Gold Sponsor) Country Head and Senior Director Ramesh Nanayakkara represented the event’s key supporters.

“NCQP 2024 demonstrates Sri Lanka’s dedication to continuous improvement and its pursuit of excellence,” said Chief Guest Dr. Saranga Alahapperuma. “The innovative projects showcased here have a significant impact not only on business success but also on achieving sustainable development goals.”

This successful convention underscores SLAAQP’s crucial role in promoting quality and productivity in Sri Lanka since its establishment in 1989. As a non-profit organisation comprising professionals committed to national development, SLAAQP continues to play a vital part in uplifting Sri Lanka’s quality and productivity standards.

The NCQP 2024 has set a new benchmark for quality and innovation in Sri Lanka, paving the way for continued growth and excellence in the years to come.
