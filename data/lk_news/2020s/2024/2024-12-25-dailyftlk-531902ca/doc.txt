Key appointments to public administration leadership

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved two key appointments to strengthen leadership within the public sector.

N.U.N. Mendis, a Special Grade Officer of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service, will assume the role of Director General of Combined Services, while Chaminda Hettiarachchi, currently the District Secretary of Trincomalee was appointed as the new Director General of the Department of Pensions, effective 1 January 2025.

Mendis, who is currently serving as an Additional Director General at the National Budget Department, will assume the role following the vacancy created by the appointment of S. Aloka Bandara as Secretary to the Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry.

The position of Director General of Combined Services is pivotal, given its extensive scope of responsibilities in managing administrative functions.

Hettiarachchi, currently serving as the District Secretary and Government Agent for the Trincomalee Administrative District, will succeed A. Jagath D. Dias, whose tenure as Director General concludes on 31 December 2024.

The decision was made following a recommendation by the Public Administration, Provincial Councils, and Local Government Minister, recognising Hettiarachchiâ€™s extensive administrative expertise and suitability for the role.
