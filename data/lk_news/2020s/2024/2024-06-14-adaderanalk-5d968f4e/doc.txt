Ex-diplomat slams govt’s handling of external debt restructuring process

The former Sri Lankan Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva, Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka says that Sri Lanka could have struck a better deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), if the island nation went to the international lender as a bipartite team consisting of both government and opposition parties.

While joining Ada Derana’s current Affairs Programme ‘At HydePark’ this afternoon (13), Dr. Jayatilleka alleged that the government is not handling the external debt restructuring process in the best way possible.

He further highlighted that the leaders of the country have managed Sri Lanka in such a way that it is now unable to be completely immune to external pressure when taking internal policy decisions.

Commenting on the upcoming election, Dr. Jayatilleka said that Sri Lanka needs a leader with a popular mandate and that the country requires a generational shift in leadership in order to move forward.

“Sri Lanka’s leader should be someone with a popular mandate. We need a generational shift in the leadership of Sri Lanka”, he added.
