59 trees fall within Colombo in seven days

Colombo, May 25 (Daily Mirror) - A total of 59 trees have fallen within the Colombo Municipal Council's jurisdiction in the past week due to high winds, Colombo Municipal Commissioner Bhadrani Jayawardena revealed.

According to the Commissioner, 19 tree falls were recorded in the Vihara Maha Devi Park, with most other incidents occurring along the main roads.

“The Colombo Municipal Council, supported by the security forces, is currently removing the fallen trees,” she noted.

Jayawardena stated that many of the affected trees were not initially at risk but succumbed to the strong winds.

Furthermore, Jayawardena highlighted that nearly 200 trees, aged between 50 and 150 years, are in dangerous conditions.

“Due to significant rot, a large number of these trees have been preemptively cut down to prevent further incidents,” she added.
