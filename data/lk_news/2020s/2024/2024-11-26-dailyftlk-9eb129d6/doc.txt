Sujeewa Senasinghe’s luxury SUV released on Rs. 100 m bond

Fort Magistrate Thanuja Lakmali yesterday directed the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to release a luxury V8 SUV belonging to former MP Sujeewa Senasinghe, currently under CID custody, back to its owner.

The Magistrate observed that the SUV had been lawfully imported into Sri Lanka, adhering to all required procedures, and issued the release order accordingly.

During the hearing, the CID reported that the SUV was initially brought into the country as a duty-free vehicle by former MP J. Sri Ranga, who had used it until it was involved in an accident in Settikulam. Following the incident, the vehicle was sold to its current owner, Sujeewa Senasinghe.

The CID, however, raised concerns about discrepancies in the MT6 form related to the vehicle’s ownership transfer, claiming that the signature on the form might not match that of the former owner. They said that further investigations into the matter were ongoing.

Appearing for Sujeewa Senasinghe, Counsel Maitree Gunaratna PC, Farman Cassim PC, and Harith Hettiarachchi, along with Attorneys-at-Law Padma Sriyan Punchihewa, Ahmed Thalal, and Fathima Falilah, argued that any doubts about the signature should be referred to the Government Analyst. They emphasised that no complaints had been lodged with the CID or police to date regarding the vehicle’s legality.

Counsel Hettiarachchi further alleged that the search of Senasinghe’s residence was conducted maliciously. He contended that the CID had misled the Court by falsely claiming that LTTE uniforms were stored at Senasinghe’s premises and subsequently alleging that the SUV, valued at approximately Rs. 100 million, was illegally assembled.

On 11 November, the Fort Magistrate’s Court had initially ordered the CID to seize the vehicle, submit it to the Government Analyst, and obtain a report. Following further inquiries, the Court has now ordered the vehicle’s release to Senasinghe on a bond of Rs. 100 million.  The case was postponed to 5 February 2025.
