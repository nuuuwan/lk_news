Public urged to report information on misuse of govt-owned vehicles

Sri Lanka Police are requesting the public to call the special hotline ‘1997’ to provide any information regarding the misuse of the government-owned vehicles.

Issuing a communiqué, the police headquarters requests the public to report any information related to the vehicles issued by the government for various official purposes that may have been unlawfully concealed in certain locations or have been neglected after being parked in certain places and left to dilapidate.

This hotline is available around the clock, and the police assure that the identities of those who provide information will be kept confidential and that information can be provided anonymously.

However, the police stress that only accurate information should be given, as legal action will be taken against anyone who provides false information.
