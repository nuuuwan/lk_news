Supreme Court summons immigration chief over e-Visa issue

The Supreme Court has directed the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration to appear before the court in person today (13) with regard to his failure to implement the order issued by the court over the electronic visa matter.

The directive was issued by the Supreme Court after considering motions filed over the non-implementation of the interim order issued by the court regarding the issue, Ada Derana reporter said.

On August 02, the Supreme Court issued an interim order suspending the contract given to private consortium IVS-GBS and VFS Global to operate the visa issuance.

The court had issued this order after considering several Fundamental Rights (FR) petitions filed by a group including opposition MPs M.A. Sumanthiran, Rauff Hakeem and Patali Champika Ranawaka.
