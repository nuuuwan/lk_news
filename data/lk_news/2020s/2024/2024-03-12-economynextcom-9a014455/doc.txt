ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has awarded contracts to Mahawa Solar (Pvt) Ltd, Hayleys Power Ltd, and Capital City Holdings (Pvt) Ltd to build and operate solar power plants for Matara grid substation and Vavunathivu substation, Minister Bandula Gunawardena said.

“International competitive bids were called for solar photovoltaic power plants for Matara (10 MW) and Vavunathivu (8 MW) grid substations,” Gunawardena said.

Based on the project proposals received, the Cabinet of Ministers approved awarding the contract for the commissioning of a ground mounted solar photovoltaic power plant at Matara Grid Substation to Mahawa Solar (Pvt) Ltd and Hayleys Power Ltd.

The contract for the installation at Vavunathivu Substation was awarded to Capital City Holdings (Pvt) Ltd.
