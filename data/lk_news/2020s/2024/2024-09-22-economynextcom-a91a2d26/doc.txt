Sri Lanka cenbank chief sees no reason to resign after defeat of reformist leader

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said he saw no reason to resign from his post after President Ranil Wickremesinghe was defeated in Saturday’s poll.

Weerasinghe was a key official who helped the island nation’s economic reforms under an International Monetary Fund (IMF)-led bailout package after the country plunged into an unprecedented economic crisis.

“I don’t see any reason for me to resign,” Weerasinghe told Economy Next, amid resignation speculation.

Both top presidential candidates Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayaka have promised to renegotiate the IMF deal if they win.

Under Weerasinghe, the island nation’s currency got stabilized and appreciated sharply, inflation slowed to lower single digit from more than 70 percent, the central bank enacted a new act to be independent from the government, and stopped money printing.

Weerasinghe, a career central banker, in the past has repeatedly said the country should continue with the IMF economic reforms to stability.

He took over as the 17th governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka when the island nation faced the economic and dent crisis.

He was appointed by former leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa in April 2022 before reappointed to the same post in July 2022 for another six years.

Central Bank governor is appointed by the country’s president with the approval of a Constitutional Council. However, a central bank governor cannot be removed at the discretion of president. (Colombo/September 22/2024)
