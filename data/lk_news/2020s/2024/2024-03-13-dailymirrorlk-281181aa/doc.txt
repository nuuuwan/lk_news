Chinese woman who left her child with Sri Lankan nanny arrested at BIA

Katunayake, March 13 (Daily Mirror)- A Chinese woman who attempted to leave her younger daughter aged three and half with her Sri Lankan nanny and flee from the country was arrested at the Katunayake International Airport by the Airport Police last night when she was about to board the plane.

Investigations revealed that the 35 year-old Chinese woman had been living with her mother and two daughters in a rented house in Dubai and earned her living as a dancer in night clubs.

The Sri Lankan nanny employed by her to look after the younger daughter was a 53 year-old woman from Potuhera in Kurunegala. She had returned to the country recently after the expiry of her visa, but the little child who loved her more than the mother was taken ill after separating from her and could not be consoled.

The Chinese woman and her mother with the child had arrived to Sri Lanka a couple of days ago and, as requested, met by the Sri Lankan woman. They had left the child with the latter and under the pretext of going away for a while, had sneaked out from the airport.

During investigations into the complaint from the Sri Lankan woman, police arrested the two Chinese women who attempted to fly back to Dubai leaving the child with her former nanny. The child was admitted to the Negombo Hospital under the care of the Sri Lankan woman.

The two Chinese women were to be produced before the Negombo magistrate.
