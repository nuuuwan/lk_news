National policy on planting trees soon: Pramitha Bandara

Colombo, May 24 (Daily Mirror)- Claiming that an increase in accidents involving fallen trees by the roadsides have been observed recently, State Minister of Defense Pramitha Banadara Tennakoon said and added that a special committee will be appointed soon to draft a national policy on planting trees.

He told a news conference that a national policy will be introduced aiming to control and mitigate accidents caused due to falling and fallen trees.

The Minister said there is no policy for tree planting in Sri Lanka where anyone can plant any tree at any time and added that the Singapore model is to be studied and adopted in this regard.

"An increasing tendency of trees on the roadsides falling have been observed. We expect the support of the Road Development Authority (RDA), the Provincial Road Development Authority (PRDA) and Local Government agencies to control and mitigate this situation. We don't have a national policy on planting trees in Sri Lanka. Anyone can plant any tree at any time. We deem it necessary to introduce a national policy for planting trees. We are to study and adopt the Singapore model. People will be made aware of trees that should be planted near roadsides," he said.

The Minister said there was no institution to issue warnings on risks involving trees. The National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) has been entrusted with the responsibility now. They are still developing their human and other resources needed to cope with the situation," he said.

He also said a special programme will be introduced in schools to prevent any accidents involving trees and other possible accidents due to various constructions.

The Minister said the tri-forces, police and the Civil Defense Force are on standby to face any disaster situation due to the inclement weather. He said 34,880 people from 9,616 families have been affected due to the prevailing inclement weather and that six deaths have been reported.
