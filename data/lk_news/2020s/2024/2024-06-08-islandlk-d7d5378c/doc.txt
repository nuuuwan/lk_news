2,000 Trees for the Planet: Aitken Spence Hotels leads World Environment Day effort

In celebration of World Environment Day, Aitken Spence Hotels reaffirms its unwavering commitment to sustainability with the planting of 2,000 trees across its properties in Sri Lanka, the Maldives, India, and Oman. This ambitious initiative not only underscores the company’s dedication to environmental conservation but also serves as a call to action for global ecological responsibility.

Across its Sri Lankan properties, including Heritance Kandalama, Heritance Ahungalla, Heritance Tea Factory, Heritance Ayurveda, Sentido Heritance Negombo, Turyaa Kalutara, Amethyst Resort, and Earl’s Regency, a total of 1,730 trees will be planted. Heritance Kandalama, Aitken Spence’s flagship sustainable hotel, will lead the effort by planting 780 trees in addition to its extensive bio-conservation efforts with 211 acres of conservation land, coinciding with its 30th-anniversary celebrations later this month.

In the Maldives, 135 trees will be planted across resorts such as Heritance Aarah, Adaaran Prestige Vadoo, Adaaran Select Meedhupparu, Adaaran Select Hudhuran Fushi, and Adaaran Club Rannalhi. Additionally, Adaaran Select Hudhuran Fushi will undertake the replanting of over 400 corals, aligning with World Environment Day and reinforcing the commitment to reef conservation.

The Al Falaj Hotel in Oman will plant 85 trees, while Turyaa Chennai in India will contribute by planting 50 trees. These efforts involve hotel staff, guests, and local communities to foster awareness about the importance of tree planting and its benefits to society.
