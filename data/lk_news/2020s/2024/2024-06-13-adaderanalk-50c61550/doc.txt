T20 World Cup nightmare: Sri Lanka team stranded in USA due to Florida floods

The Sri Lanka cricket team’s T20 World Cup campaign has been struck by a double dose of bad luck. Heavy flooding in Florida has left them stranded in Fort Lauderdale, forcing them to delay their travel to Saint Lucia for their next match.

The team’s original flight to the Caribbean was canceled due to the floods, throwing their schedule into disarray. With their next match against the Netherlands scheduled for Monday, June 17th, Sri Lanka are hoping to fly out on Friday.

Floods in Florida has left Sri Lankan team stranded in US. The team was supposed to fly out from Fort Lauderdale this evening to Caribbean, but now are staying back in US. A state of emergency has been issued by Mayor of Fort Lauderdale. The team is expected to fly out tomorrow.

Adding to their woes, Sri Lanka’s match against Nepal on Wednesday was completely washed out due to the same extreme weather. This resulted in a shared point for both teams, which isn’t ideal for Sri Lanka’s qualification chances.

Sri Lanka’s path to the Super Eights stage has become a lot narrower due to the washed-out match. Here’s what they need to happen:

-Washed Out Match Between Bangladesh and Netherlands: This scenario would ensure both teams get just one point, keeping their chances alive.

-South Africa Wins Against Nepal: Sri Lanka needs South Africa to defeat Nepal on Friday.

-Sri Lanka Wins Against Netherlands: This is a must-win situation for Sri Lanka on Monday.

-Favorable Net Run Rate: Even if the above conditions are met, Sri Lanka might still need a good net run rate to progress if they end up tied on points with Bangladesh, Netherlands, and Nepal.

The Sri Lankan team faces a race against time and weather to reach Saint Lucia and potentially qualify for the Super Eights. Their situation remains precarious, and they’ll be relying on a combination of their own performance and favorable results in other matches.
