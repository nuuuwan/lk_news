Teacher-principal trade unions to launch work-to-rule campaign

The Teacher-Principal Trade Union Alliance has decided to launch a work-to-rule campaign for two weeks starting from July 22.

Accordingly, the trade unions have decided to withdraw from all activities outside the scope of their school-related duties.

The General Secretary of the Ceylon Teachersâ€™ Union (CTU) Joseph Stalin revealed this today (16) while speaking at a press conference held by the Teacher-Principal trade unions in Colombo.
