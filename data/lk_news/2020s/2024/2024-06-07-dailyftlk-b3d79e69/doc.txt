Spa Ceylon clinches double win at Pure Beauty Global Awards 2024, dominating Global Beauty Awards season

Spa Ceylon, the world’s largest Luxury Ayurveda chain, added another accolade to its trailblazer legacy by clinching a double-win at the prestigious Pure Beauty Global Awards 2024, held recently in London, following a winning streak of 17 international awards in the global beauty circuit.

The Pure Beauty Global Awards celebrates the world’s best in beauty from the past year. More than 400 entries from 40 countries competed in the awards this year, where the Pure Beauty team and an expert panel of judges chose the brightest products of 2024.

Spa Ceylon was amongst the handful of multiple-award winners of the night, sweeping the board in the Natural & Organic category, by winning the Best Natural & Organic Icon, for the Sleep Intense Dream Balm, and the Best Natural Beauty Product for the True Turmeric Vitamin C Glow Renewing Treatment Serum. In addition, the brand was a finalist in the Best Wellness Icon category for the De-stress Harmonising Balm.

“Consistently winning in the international awards circuit displays how well the brand is attuned to the needs of the global skincare consumer,” said Spa Ceylon Co-Founder and Director Shalin Balasuriya. “We achieve this by leveraging 5,000-year-old knowledge of Ayurveda and modern skincare science to deliver high-quality products to consumers around the world,” he added.

The win follows Spa Ceylon’s exceptional achievement at the Universal Beauty Awards, UK, held earlier this year, as the most awarded Ayurveda wellness brand. Spa Ceylon has dominated this year’s beauty and wellness awards calendar by clinching more than 17 international awards for 2024.

“This win is a testament to our team’s dedication and commitment to creating truly unique and world-class products, backed by strong R&D and high-quality manufacturing of international standards. To see our collective commitment recognised globally is both a humbling and rewarding experience,” said Spa Ceylon Co-Founder/Managing Director Shiwantha Dias.

The co-founders were present at the Pure Beauty Global Awards 2024 winners’ ceremony held at the OXO2 Tower, London, to receive the awards, which strongly position Spa Ceylon amongst the world’s top skincare and wellness products. With over 140 branded locations across 33 countries, Spa Ceylon continues its rapid global expansion, launching its most recent international stores in the Czech Republic (Prague), Mauritius (Grand Baie), and the Maldives (Male). In the next quarter of 2024, the brand will launch the latest additions to its global footprint in El Salvador (San Salvador), Kazakhstan (Astana), UAE (Dubai), China (Hong Kong), and Greece (Athens).
