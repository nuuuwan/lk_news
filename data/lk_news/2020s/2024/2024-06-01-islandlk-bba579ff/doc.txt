SFML Director Brand & Corporate Communications, Kalinga Wijesekera responded to The Island Financial Review:

What initiatives has Serendib Flour Mills undertaken to contribute to food security in Sri Lanka? How successful are you?

During the economic crisis in SL there were many shortages of essential items such as fuel, gas and other food items. However, there were no queues for flour or bread because we were able to supply without an interruption. At any given time we store a minimum of three months of grains in our silos and another two months of grain requirement is on order at all times. We manage 5 warehouses across the country. At any given time these warehouses carry 30% of the monthly requirement of flour at any given time. As a result we are able to swiftly deliver to any market within a short time span. These measures have helped us to positively contribute to the food security of the country.

How has SFML diversified its product offerings in the wheat flour market since its establishment in 2008?

When Serendib entered the market in 2008 there were only one or two flour types/products. We were the first to segment the market and come out with different flour types to suit each segment. Example; Bakers flour for the bakery Industry, Rotti flour for the eateries, Household flour for domestic households and similarly Noodle flour, Biscuit flour, Cake flour, Whole meal flour etc. etc. . Today we offer 20+ varieties of flour to our customers.

Can you describe SFML’s role and its impact on the bakery industry?

We consider the bakery Industry as a very vital industry and work very closely with the All Ceylon Bakery Owners Association. We have regular meetings with its chairman and the committee to understand what is required and supports them in various endeavors. We have Bakers flour in 25Kg and 50Kg, especially designed for the bakery Industry. It’s ideal for making of bread and other bakery products. Recently we launched Premium Bakery flour for those bakeries looking for a superior product. Premium flour provides whither and a softer bread which is also tastes better. Because of the higher gluten wheat it gives a better yield i.e. more loafs of bread. All in all Premium flour gives a superior loaf of Bread.

In addition we also have a technical team providing technical assistance to the bakers, new product development, new recipe development, trouble shooting, costing and pricing etc. on FOC basis 24/7.

What is the significance of the fortified flour product ‘Serendib Adi Shakthi’ in addressing dietary issues among the plantation communities in Sri Lanka?

According to WHO and the Ministry of Health 1 in every 3 school going children is suffering from anemia in the country. This is more prevalent among the tea plantation communities as a result of a lack of a balanced diet. According to research, lack of Folate in pregnant women contributes to certain defects in the new born. SFML along with the Plantation Human Development Trust (PHDT), after many rounds of discussions, came up with this concept of providing a fortified flour, i.e. fortified with Iron, Folic acid and Vitamin B12 to address these dietary issues of the tea plantation communities. Wheat flour, being one of the main sources of nutrition of the plantation communities, this was the ideal way of addressing their anaemic conditions and folate deficiencies. ‘Adi Shakthi’- fortified flour was crafted and distributed exclusively to the tea plantations.

How does SFML’s new wheat flour product, ‘7 Star Fibre Plus’, aim to combat non-communicable diseases (NCDs) prevalent in Sri Lanka?

According to statistics in SL over 25% adults are overweight, while 9.2% are obese. NCDs kill 41m people, i.e. to 71% of all deaths globally, while in SL it is 83%. Life styles of people are the major contributor to this situation. Recognizing this factor SFML launched ‘7 Star Fibre Plus’ to address these issues. Dietary fibre is found in wheat grain. ‘7 Star Fibre Plus’ is enriched with fibre, providing 10% of your daily fibre needs. According to research, Individuals with high intakes of dietary fibre appear to be at significantly lower risk for developing NCDs. Increasing fibre intake lowers blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels.

Could you elaborate on SFML’s initiatives towards community welfare, particularly during times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters?

Serendib undertook the initiative to facilitate elderly people to witness the annual Kandy Dalada Perahera. Titled ‘Serendib Uthama Dalada 2023’, Serendib organized elderly people from over four elders homes located in Central and Northwestern Provinces to witness the majestic event. SFML ensured all facilities, such as, transport, food and seating arrangements were provided to these elders to witness the Perahera in comfort.

Similarly, during the height of Covid, Serendib embarked on a journey to supply wheat flour to over 1,000 families in the Chilaw district at a time when the curfew was in place and people were deprived of their daily incomes. The program was titled ‘7 Star Manusathkara’, aimed to nourish the vulnerable sections of society.

On the same lines over 2,500 flood- affected families in Kinniya and Kalmunai areas were provided with their wheat flour requirements during the recent floods in these regions earlier this year.
