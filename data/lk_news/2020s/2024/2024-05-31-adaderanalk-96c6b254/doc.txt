Court moved against gazetted minimum daily wage of plantation workers

The Court of Appeal has adjourned further consideration of a petition filed by plantation companies seeking writ order invalidating the gazette notification issued by the Minister of Labor stipulating a minimum daily wage for plantation workers, until next Monday (June 03).

The petition, filed by 21 plantation companies including Agarapatana Plantations Ltd., was taken for consideration today (31) before a two-member Appeals Court judge bench consisting of Justices Sobitha Rajakaruna and Dhammika Ganepola.

The petitioners have named 52 individuals including Minister of Labor Manusha Nanayakkara and the Labor Commissioner as respondents of the case.

The petitioning plantation companies point out that the Minister of Labor has issued a gazette notification setting the minimum daily wage of a plantation worker at Rs. 1,350, together with an allowance of Rs. 300 and another allowance of Rs. 80, as minimum wage.

The petitioners claim that the decision taken by the Minister of Labor without consulting them, violates the legal principle of natural justice.

Accordingly, the petitioners seek an order invalidating the decision, claiming that the decision was made arbitrarily by the government.
