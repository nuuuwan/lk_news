Sri Lankan philately into record books

Philatelic Bureau, Department of Posts Sri Lanka along with Sri Dalada Maligawa will issue the longest stamp in the world measuring 205mm thereby beating the recently released Philippines longest stamp (measuring 200mm released on 12 June 2024).

The stamp will depict the Esala Perahera procession in vibrant colours and be valued at Rs. 500.

The record breaking took place yesterday (20 August) at President’s House in Kandy after the Day Procession (Dahawal Perahera) when the ‘Perahera Sandeshaya’ was presented to the President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

The following items were issued: Stamp, souvenir sheet (miniature sheet), first day cover (FDC) and folder.

Commenting on the record, Philatelic Association of Sri Lanka President Gihan Fernando emphasised the importance of this achievement as it has many advantages to Sri Lanka.

“It would be a much sought after item in the world of philately. It would arouse curiosity for Sri Lankan stamps as well as add value as a tourism product enticing tourists to visit Sri Lanka to witness the event in person. For extreme-philatelists, it would mean that they would get the stamp as well as visit the event since they need to take a picture of the stamp and the event depicted in the stamp. Extreme-philatelists or not, this stamp would be a must have and be in high demand among the many enthusiastic local philatelists too,” Fernando added.

The items are available for purchase online and from the philatelic bureau counters.
