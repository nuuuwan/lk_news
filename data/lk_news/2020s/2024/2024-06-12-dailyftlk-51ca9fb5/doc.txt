NMSJ urges immediate Parliamentary action on national unity and justice

The National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) led by former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has issued a call to action, urging both the ruling party and the Opposition to urgently address critical national issues to foster unity and justice.

Emphasising the need to cultivate mutual trust between the north and south of Sri Lanka, the NMSJ in a statement yesterday asserted that issues rooted in race and religion must never resurface. The organisation highlighted the imperative of addressing these challenges proactively, rather than leaving them for future generations.

In its press release, the NMSJ stressed the importance of tackling these issues before the next Parliamentary Elections and called on the current Government, led by the President, and the Opposition to prioritise and thoroughly address these concerns during the 9th Parliamentary term, aiming for a just society.

The NMSJ noted that the Opposition Leader has publicly emphasised the importance of enforcing the 13th Amendment to the Constitution as a means to address these issues. They said the incumbent President, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), and former Presidents Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa have also expressed their support.

“Additionally, many independent Parliamentarians and prospective Presidential candidates share this conviction. The NMSJ appreciates these positive aspirations and calls for a round table discussion involving all political parties in Parliament to resolve these matters without delay,” it said.

It also underscored the significant involvement of the Tamil diaspora of Sri Lankan origin in achieving national unity and justice. The NMSJ said it believes that the support and participation of the Tamil diaspora are crucial for addressing the country’s important issues.

The NMSJ urged all political parties, including Tamil parties, to engage in discussions on this subject and not to avoid or boycott them for any reason.

The organisation requested the Parliament and President to intervene in this matter in good faith, emphasising the necessity of decisive intervention to cultivate unity and justice in Sri Lanka.
