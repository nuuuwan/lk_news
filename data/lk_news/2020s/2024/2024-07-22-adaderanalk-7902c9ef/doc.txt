Petitions on integrating school dev. officers into teaching service settled

The Fundamental Rights (FR) petitions filed seeking the integration of all development officers, who are already employed in government schools, into the teaching service, have been settled before the Supreme Court.

The relevant petitions were taken up for consideration before the three-member Supreme Court judge bench comprising Justices A.H.M.D. Nawaz, Achala Wengappuli and Shiran Gooneratne today (22).

Additional Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne, who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General, pointed out before the court that it has been decided to interview the school development officers and integrate over 25,000 of them, who meet the required qualifications, into the teaching service.

He further informed the court that the recruitments will be carried out subject to a maximum age limit of 40 years for national schools and 45 years for provincial schools.

The Additional Solicitor General also explained that the Cabinet paper related to these recruitments will be forwarded to the Cabinet of Ministers immediately and the recruitment process will be carried out after obtaining its approval.

After noting all the conditions put forward, the Supreme Court permitted the settlement of the case in relation to the petitions.

A group of school development officers had filed these petitions seeking a Supreme Court ruling that their Fundamental Rights have been violated due to the failure to integrate them into the teaching service despite them being engaged in teaching activities for several years.
