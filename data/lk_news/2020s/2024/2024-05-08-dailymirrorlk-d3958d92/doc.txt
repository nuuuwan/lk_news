Mujibur Rahman likely to replace Diana Gamage?

Parliament, May 8, (Daily Mirror) - The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) will hold a discussion shortly to decide on who will fill the national list slot that has fallen vacant as a result of the Supreme Court decision that Diana Gamage cannot function as an MP as she is not a citizen of Sri Lanka, party General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara said today.

“We will meet shortly to decide on the matter,” he told the Daily Mirror.

“Mujibur Rahman lost his parliamentary seat because of the decision made by us to field him as the SJB mayoral candidate for the Colombo Municipal Council at the local government polls scheduled to be held earlier. We will consider this fact when deciding on who will replace Diana Gamage,” he added.

Also, he said the Supreme Court had delivered a landmark judgment with regard to State Minister Gamage.

MP Nalin Bandara who informed Parliament on the judgment thanked the Supreme Court.
