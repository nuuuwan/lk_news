South Korea will continue to provide smart classrooms for schools, and information technology equipment for vocational training institutes, according to the statement.

“Many under developed areas of Sri Lanka has benefited, especially Kegalle and Ratnapura in Sabaragamuwa Province. I am glad that Governor himself visited Sri Lanka and signed this proposal for the welfare of these rural populations,” Gunawardena was quoted as saying.

“We look forward to working with Korea closely on new technology and new investments applicable to many areas today. We hope this cooperation can be strengthened and taken forward.” (Colombo/Apr4/2024)
