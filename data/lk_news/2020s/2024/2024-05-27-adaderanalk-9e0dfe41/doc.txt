Important notice for vehicles arriving at Katunayake Airport premises

Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) (Private) Limited says that necessary steps have been taken to streamline the parking of vehicles outside the arrival terminal at Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake.

Accordingly, a decision has been taken to prohibit the parking of vehicles without a driver at that location and also that vehicles arriving to pick up passengers should remain at the car park and arrive at the front of the airportâ€™s arrival terminal only at the scheduled time for the pickup.

Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) (Private) Limited also stated that if the vehicles are parked for more than 30 minutes at that location while causing traffic congestion in the area even with the driver, an extra fee would be charged when the vehicles are leaving the premises.

They further stated that the main objective of this is to control the arrival of unauthorized vehicles and persons at the airport premises.
