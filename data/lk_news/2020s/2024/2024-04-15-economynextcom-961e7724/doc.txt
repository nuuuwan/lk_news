Sri Lanka airport briefed on Boeing B777-9 operations

ECONOMYNEXT – America’s Boeing has briefed Sri Lanka’s main international airport on the B777-9 airliner which is expected to enter service in mid-2025, the state airport agency said.

Richard Vaisvila, Lead Engineer of Airport Operations at Boeing Airport Operations Engineering conducted the technical session, state-run Airport and Aviation Services said.

Officials from AASL and SriLankan Airlines had attended the session. SriLankan has the ground handling franchise at the airport.

Boeing’s B-777X model promises greater fuel efficiency with the 777 dash 9 and can carry over 400 passengers in a two – class configuration.

The aircraft has foldable wing-tips allowing it to be parked at airports that can accommodate earlier B-777 style aircraft with a smaller wingspan (Code E).
