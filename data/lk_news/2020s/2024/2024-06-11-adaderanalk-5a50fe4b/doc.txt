Approval for AG’s service extension postponed

The Constitutional Council has postponed the granting approval for the President’s recommendation to extend the tenure of Attorney General Sanjay Rajaratnam by six months.

The decision was made during a council meeting held yesterday (10), where it was agreed to defer the discussion for further deliberation.

Rajaratnam’s current term is set to expire at the end of this month, and the President had proposed an extension for an additional six months.

However, the proposal requires the approval of the Constitutional Council, which has been delayed.

Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana has announced that the Constitutional Council is scheduled to reconvene on the 18th of this month.

It is anticipated that a final decision regarding the extension of Attorney General Rajaratnam’s service will be reached during this meeting.
