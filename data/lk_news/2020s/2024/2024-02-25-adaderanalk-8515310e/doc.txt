SriLankan Airlines issues clarification on multiple flight delays

SriLankan Airlines has issued a clarification on the delay experienced at the check-in counters at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake earlier today (25 Feb.).

Issuing a statement in this regard, the national carrier assured that the delays were caused due to temporary, unplanned operational conditions at the airport and not due to any type of trade union action.

“The check-in counter operations have been stabilized and returned to normal as of now. SriLankan Airlines would like to apologize to any passengers inconvenienced by these operational delays, while the airline continues to monitor the situation and take steps to avoid a recurrence”, the statement concluded.

It was reported, earlier this morning, that four SriLankan Airlines flights were delayed at the BIA, as ground staff had reportedly refrained from performing some of their duties.
