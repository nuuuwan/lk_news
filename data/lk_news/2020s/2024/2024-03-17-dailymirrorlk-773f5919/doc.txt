Match-fixing allegations: Court issues travel ban on two Indian cricket managers

The Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court has issued an order preventing two team managers of the Legend Cricket League from leaving the country over match-fixing allegations. The Legend Cricket League tournament, featuring seven teams of retired international cricketers, is currently underway at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium.

Colombo Additional Magistrate Pasan Amarasena made this order pursuant to a request made by the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) for Preventing Sports Offences, and this order will be effective for a one-month period starting on March 15.

The court issued this order based on a complaint made by Sri Lankan former cricketer Upul Tharanga, who represents the Kandy Samp Army, and New Zealand legend Neil Broom, representing the Punjab Royals, alleging that they were pressured to engage in match fixing deals.

This tournament is currently being held at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium until March 19. The travel restrictions were imposed on Yoni Patel and P. Akash, which will be valid for one month. (LS)
