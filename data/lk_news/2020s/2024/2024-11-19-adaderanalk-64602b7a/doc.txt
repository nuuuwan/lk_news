Parliament sets up information counter for freshly elected MPs

The Secretary General of Parliament, Mrs. Kushani Rohanadheera announced that an information counter will be kept open today (19) and tomorrow (20) to assist freshly elected Members of Parliament with activities related to the first session of the Tenth Parliament.

The counter will be operational from 9.30 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. at the Parliament complex. It will provide MPs with essential documents, facilitate the issuance of parliamentary ID cards, and record fingerprints for electronic voting purposes.

Speaking on the initiative, Mrs. Rohanadheera explained, “MPs can visit the counter in person or register online by providing the required information. Fingerprints will also be recorded.”

“Over two-thirds of the MPs elected to the Tenth Parliament are new members. In light of this, a three-day workshop has been organized for November 25, 26, and 27 to educate them on parliamentary procedures, expected behavior, dress code, chamber protocols, committee formats, and the rules of debate,” she added.
