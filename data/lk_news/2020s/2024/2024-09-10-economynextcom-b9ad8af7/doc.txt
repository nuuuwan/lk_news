Sri Lanka opens path to export wheat bran to China

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet has approved the signing of an agreement with China to allow exports of wheat bran pellets, spokesman Minister Bandula Gunawardana said.

Sri Lanka’s wheat mills produce bran as a by product which can be made into pellets and exported to China.

The agreement sets out the protocol to be followed in the export of wheat bran pellets from Sri Lanka to China.

“When processing wheat flour, 20 percent of the bran is removed from the imported wheat seeds,”Gunawardana told reporters.

“We could earn foreign exchange by exporting the bran to China as pellets.”

The agreement will be signed between the Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries and the General Administration of the Customs of the People’s Republic of China. (Colombo/Sep10/2024)
