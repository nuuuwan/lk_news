Sri Lanka likely to adopt Singaporean house detention method for minor offenses

Colombo, Feb 06 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka will soon likely adopt the Singaporean method to implement house detention for suspects who are charged with minor offenses.

House detention, also known as home confinement, aims to reduce recidivism and alleviate prison overcrowding.

The Ministry of Justice and Prison Affairs is planning to implement a programme this year to place those found guilty of civil offenses under house arrest.

Prisons Spokesman Gamini Dissanayake told the Daily Mirror that the ministry and the department are in the process of drafting laws in this regard and once the process is finalized, it needs to be passed in Parliament.

He said many countries including Singapore are using the home detention method . Once the programme is implemented, the suspects who are charged with minor offenses will undergo house arrest on the orders of the Judges.

The spokesman said that offenders will have to remain indoors for the duration specified in the order and attend counseling or rehabilitation sessions.

He said the person will also need to wear an electronic chip or watch to monitor their whereabouts. If the offender goes too far from their home, the violation is recorded, and the police will be notified.

The spokesman said these measures are specifically being taken to reduce overcrowding in prisons.

Recent data from the Prisons Department shows that there are a whopping 33,000 inmates detained in 30 prisons across the country, even though these facilities are meant to hold only around 13,000 inmates.
