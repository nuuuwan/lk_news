SriLankan Airlines changes London route after Israel attack; carries extra fuel

ECONOMYNEXT – SriLankan Airlines, the country’s national carrier, has changed its regular route over Iraq skies to London and is carrying extra fuel after Iran’s missile attack on Israel, a SriLankan official said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised that Iran would pay for its missile attack against Israel on Tuesday, while Tehran said any retaliation would be met with “vast destruction”, raising fears of a wider war.

The Iran attack has threatened escalation of fighting in the Middle East.

“We have now changed the London flight route and now flying via Egypt skies,” the official told EconomyNext.

“The new route takes 30 minutes longer than the usual route and the flights carry extra fuel in the new route.” (Colombo/October 03/2024)
