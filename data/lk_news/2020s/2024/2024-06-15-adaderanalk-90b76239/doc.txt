Railway strike temporarily called off

The Sri Lanka Railway Station Masters’ Union has decided to temporarily call off their planned strike action, with the suspension in effect until next Tuesday (18).

This was announced by the President of the Railway Station Masters’ Union, Sumedha Somaratne.

He explained that, “During the discussion with the General Manager of Railways, we received positive responses to some of our demands. However, they were unable to provide a specific answer regarding promotions and other issues.”

He further elaborated that the Acting Minister participated in the discussions and identified a contradiction between the Cabinet paper sent by the department and the letter sent by the Ministry.

“This discrepancy is the reason for the current problem,” Somaratne noted. He added that a correction has been approved and is promised to be addressed during the Public Service Commission meeting on Tuesday.

“The problems stem from addressing individual issues without resolving the overall challenges facing the railway service,” Somaratne continued, adding “We hope to receive a positive response.”
