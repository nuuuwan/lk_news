Soap and Allied Industries Ltd. (SAIL), a leading entity under the esteemed Colombo Machinery and Equipment Ltd. (CMEL), recently marked its 25th anniversary, commemorating an extraordinary journey from humble beginnings to becoming an industry leader in the chemical and raw material market.

In a joyful burst of celebration and elegance, SAIL unfurled a splendid event at Shangri-La Colombo, marking 25 years of success. The luminaries of SAIL’s journey, including Nestlé, Hemas, Unilever, Coca-Cola, and other esteemed partners like Delmage, Basilur Tea, ICL Marketing, Teejay Lanka and more, added their presence to the occasion. It wasn’t just a night of accolades; it was a heartfelt symphony of gratitude to those integral to SAIL’s path.

Excitement filled the air as employees, the backbone of SAIL, were honoured with Silver Coins and special tour packages to Dubai, a testament to the company’s commitment to its dedicated team. The stage was set for a new chapter as everyone eagerly awaited the centrepiece – the unveiling of SAIL’s new logo. This emblem, a beautiful representation of the company’s history, signalled not just a celebration of the past but a confident step into an innovative future.

As the new logo took its place, another enchanting dimension unfolded – the Flavour and Fragrance Experience Centre in collaboration with Argeville of France. This contemporary space, showcasing SAIL’s commitment to innovation, invited guests on a sensory journey through scents and tastes. It was more than an unveiling; it was an open invitation to embark on a collaborative journey, where creativity and innovation danced hand in hand.

In this tapestry of celebration, SAIL didn’t just commemorate 25 years; it painted an ode to resilience, creativity, and the bonds woven into its success story. With applause echoing through the Shangri-La halls, it became clear – SAIL wasn’t just revelling in the past; it was scripting the narrative of an even more extraordinary future.

SAIL Director Rizky Deen said: “SAIL’s 25th anniversary is a testament to our resilience, adaptability, and commitment to excellence. We express our heartfelt gratitude to our customers, partners, and employees who have been integral to our success. The new logo reflects our journey and sets the stage for many more years of excellence in every endeavour.”

Founded in 1998 with three employees and a modest capital, SAIL embarked on its journey in a 500-square-feet rented space. Evolving over the years, it became a leading importer and supplier of chemicals, shaping Sri Lanka’s manufacturing landscape. In 2007, SAIL’s commitment to growth was evident as it relocated to its own modern five-story building in Colombo. The year 2009 saw the company diversify into flavours, expanding its product portfolio. Despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, SAIL showcased resilience by swiftly transitioning to remote work, digitalising its systems, and maintaining uninterrupted operations. The pinnacle came in 2022, as SAIL achieved its highest turnover, setting new benchmarks for success despite market turbulence.

SAIL said it takes pride in its 25-year commitment to providing top-quality raw materials, specialising in soap and detergent industry. Adhering to the highest industry standards, SAIL’s comprehensive range includes essential ingredients like caustic soda, soap noodles, dyes, pigments, and fragrances required to food and beverage, confectionery, soap and detergent, cosmetics, textiles, rubber, and plastic industries as well as water treatment facilities.

The company extends its expertise into chemicals and fragrances, offering high-quality Glycerine, Lauric Acid, and various fragrances from France for perfumes, personal care, and beauty products. Venturing into the culinary realm, SAIL introduces flavours sourced from Argeville of France, enhancing the sensory experience in food and beverage products. SAIL is also into blending, processing, warehousing, logistics, clearing and custom packaging.

As SAIL looks to the future, it remains dedicated to excellence, sustainability, and innovation, reinforcing its role as a reliable partner in the success of its clients and industries served.
