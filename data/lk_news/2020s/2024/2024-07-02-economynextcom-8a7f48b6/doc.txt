Sri Lanka to make US$5bn interest savings in bilateral debt deal: President

ECONOMYNEXT â€“ Sri Lanka will make interest savings of 5 billion dollars on the restructured bilateral debt, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.

The interest rates on loans will be 2.1 percent or below, he told parliament Tuesday.

Sri Lanka has been given extra eight years to repay the loans till 2043 under the agreement.

This will help improve the debt repaying capacity, in the future.

Full disclosures will be made after a deal with bondholders are reached, he said.

Though he wanted to disclose the agreements in parliament, there was a request from the official creditor committee to delay it till the new government is formed in France. (Colombo/June02/2024)
