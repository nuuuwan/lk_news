Another round of Lemon Juice…

Hi! This week, too, another round of Lemon Juice…as my beauty tips for hair care…

Massage 02 tablespoons of lemon juice directly onto your scalp. After a minute, rinse your hair using a teaspoon of lemon juice mixed in a cup of water.

Heat up 06 tablespoons of coconut oil, then add the juice of a lemon and a teaspoon of honey. Mix well and apply generously to the hair and scalp. Let it rest for an hour and shampoo it as usual. This mask will help fight itchy dandruff and will take care of your split ends as well.

All you have to do is mix the juice of 02 lemons in a cup of water; apply it to the scalp and hair, and rinse off after 10 minutes for a clean scalp.

You can fill a jug with lemon juice mixed with water and use it to rinse your hair.

*  Always rinse lemon juice off using plain water after about 10 minutes.

*  Avoid exposing hair and scalp to the sun for a prolonged period after the application of lemon juice.

*  As a mask, lemon juice mixed with other ingredients, you can apply every 3-4 days. However, you shouldn’t apply only lemon juice as frequently.

*  You can wash out the lemon juice in your hair using your everyday wash routine. Just shampoo rinse and condition your hair as you would normally do.
