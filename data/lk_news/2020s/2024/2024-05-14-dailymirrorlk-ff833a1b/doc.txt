Health experts raise red flags over soaring influenza cases

Colombo, May 14 (Daily Mirror) - In the wake of the rising influenza cases at an unusual rate, health experts are urging the public to beware of symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches and fatigue.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, Dr. Deepal Perera, a Paediatrician at the Lady Ridgeway Children's Hospital in Colombo said, it’s vastly prevalent among children and thus the parents are advised to keep a close watch on their children.

“There are usually two peaks of influenza namely November to February and April to July,” he stated.

“This time, we have seen a substantial rise in cases among children and adults as well. The cases have doubled during the last week alone. As of now, the predominant type is influenza A. However, influenza B is also prevalent,” he pointed out.

In light of the situation, the expert stressed the importance of seeking prompt medical care if the symptoms persist.

Groups susceptible to influenza-like illnesses include pregnant mothers, children under two years old, individuals aged 60 and above, and those with chronic diseases.

The Secretary to the Health Ministry had earlier advised the national influenza centre to enhance Influenza-like Illness Surveillance at 20 hospitals including Colombo, Ragama, Kalubowila, Negombo Hospitals, Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children and Infectious Disease Hospital.

Accordingly, samples are directed to the national influenza laboratory on a daily basis.
