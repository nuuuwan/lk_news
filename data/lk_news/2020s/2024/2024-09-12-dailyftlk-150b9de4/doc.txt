Western Automobile Assembly Ltd., (WAA) on Tuesday announced the opening of its state of the art semi-knocked down (SKD) assembly plant in Kuliyapitiya.

It said the move marks a significant advancement in local vehicle assembly, driving economic development in Sri Lanka while equipping the nation’s youth with the skills and knowledge essential for sustainable growth and long-term prosperity.

The company has already hired over 100 direct employees including Automobile Engineering Graduates and Diploma holders of Automobile Technology to work within the plant. There is also already a cadre of 25 employees for roles within HR, Administration and Maintenance. The company has established partnerships with several local service business providers in the area oriented businesses, such as security, logistics and transport, catering, and laundering, creating a broader positive impact on the local area economy.

“In addition, we are deeply committed to training and development. We have set up an onsite training institute of international standards to provide vocational training aligned with global industry requirements. This initiative aims to offer significant employment opportunities for young associates both locally and internationally, further enhancing the microeconomic environment of the country,” the WAA management said.

This project represents a substantial investment in both the automotive industry, and the economic vitality of Sri Lanka.
