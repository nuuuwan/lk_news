Tax files for everyone impractical to be done- Champika Ranawaka

Colombo, Feb 09 (Daily Mirror) - MP Patali Champika Ranawaka, leader of the United Republic Front underscores the impracticality of preparing tax files for every citizen of Sri Lanka.

He highlights the considerable time and manpower required, indicating that it takes approximately half an hour to process a single tax file while considering all requisite criteria.

With only nine officers tasked with this responsibility, the daily processing capacity is limited to 144 files, making the processing of millions of files a daunting and time-consuming endeavour.

HeÂ  contends that prioritising the collection of unpaid taxes from the 1272 defaulters identified by the Inland Revenue Department should take precedence over opening new tax files for every individual. However, he criticises the lack of action taken by the current government in this regard, resulting in an undue burden on the populace and the adoption of impractical measures.
