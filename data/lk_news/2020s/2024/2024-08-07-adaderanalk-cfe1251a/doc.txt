Navy recovers over 4.7kg of gold from bottom of Thorayadi Lagoon

Sri Lanka Navy personnel have recovered a parcel containing gold including gold biscuits weighing over 4.7 kg from the bottom of the Thorayadi Lagoon in Kalpitiya.

A special search operation conducted by the Sri Lanka Navy at Thorayadi Lagoon in Kalpitiya yesterday (06) has led to the recovery of the parcel weighing approximately 04kg and 740g from the depths of the lagoon.

Additionally, the Navy had seized a dinghy near Thorayadi beach, which is suspected to have been used for smuggling the package.

Acting on the information received, SLNS Vijaya of the Northwestern Naval Command had carried out this special operation in Thorayadi Lagoon.

The operation had led to the recovery of the package containing 04kg and 740g of gold, including gold biscuits and solid gold objects, that had been discarded in the lagoon, as well as the seizure of a dinghy near Thorayadi Beach.

It is believed that smugglers might have deliberately sunk the package of gold to evade detection and in order to take them away later.

The package containing the gold and the dinghy held in this operation were handed over to the Customs Preventive Office, Katunayake for onward legal proceedings, the navy said.
