Nu Life Biotech to manufacture antibiotics in Sri Lanka

ECONOMYNEXT – Nu Life Biotech Pvt Ltd started construction work on its Carbapenem injectables manufacturing facility at the ‘Suwa Siri Pura’ pharmaceutical production zone in Oyamaduwa, Anuradhapura, this week.

The company’s Penem Injectable Facility will be planned, designed, engineered as per GMP Standards of NMRA, WHO, EU and PIC/S etc, it said in a statement. “The facility will conform to all relevant local statutory and regulatory requirements.”

Carbapenems are used to treat severe infections, including drug-resistant infections caused by bacteria, and are given by injection as opposed to orally.

This is the second pharmaceutical manufacturing plant to be built in the dedicated zone. Neolina Holdings Pvt Ltd laid the foundation stone in Suwa Siri Pura to manufacture Pharmaceutical Products in 2022.

The ‘Suwa Siri Pura’ pharmaceutical manufacturing zone will create 2,000 direct jobs and 5,000 indirect jobs, a State information office statement said.

“Around 85 acres of land has been allocated for the construction of 21 pharmaceutical factories. Around 2,000 direct jobs and 5,000 indirect jobs are to be created,” the statement said.

Sri Lanka spends around 120 billion rupees to import medicines, according to the statement, and only 20 percent of the country’s pharmaceutical needs are met through the local manufacture of medicine.

“The aim is to produce 80% of the requirement and the surplus production is expected to be exported,” the statement read. (Colombo/Jan18/2024)
