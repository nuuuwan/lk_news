Acquiring a yard at Kirula Road which is now the Asiri Medical Hospital

(Extracted from Simply Nahil: Maverick with the Midas touch biography of Nahil Wijesuriya)

After developing and selling the land at Bloemendhal Road, East West was in desperate need of a yard to park their heavy vehicles. As they looked at a map of Colombo, hypothetically if the land was priced at Rs. 5,000 a perch in Colombo 7, as you come out radially towards Colombo in the Jawatte Road area, there is a marked drop in price though the two areas are almost physically adjacent. After driving around the area, a large lot on Kirula Road proved satisfactory.

This lot was owned by Tudawe Brothers, but unfortunately it was encroached by many shanties. Mr. Tudawe (senior) averred, “I will sell this lot to you but I doubt the shanty folk will ever leave. I have been negotiating with them for the past 10 years to no avail.”

By now an expert in shanty clearance, Nahil took up the challenge declaring, “Let me try. The second time around should be peanuts!” Immediately on acquiring the land, Nahil summoned a meeting with all the tenants and offered cash to all of them to move. They were all in agreement of moving away, though the majority voiced their fear of being left bereft of their dues.

This was a catch 22 situation. Nahil’s problem was what if he paid them and they didn’t leave? A quick decision had to be taken so he got hold of the ‘Godfather’ of the lot, Mr. Mahatun, who owned the illicit brewery setup at the rear end of the land. Trying to keep it simple, Nahil said to Mahatun, “If all of you agree to leave, we will pay you” explaining to him the conditions of payment. He was happy and persuaded Nahil to have one drink in celebration – moonlight hooch. He found himself gradually getting high on this rubbish, made his excuses and left on a positive note.

Lester (Weinman) was out of Colombo when Nahil executed the transaction with these folk. He assured Lester that he would clear the tenants in three months, but managed to do so in one month. Finally, the entire ‘watte’ left the site, with Nahil making sure each family found places to re-locate to, and also helped to transport their bits and pieces.

He immediately got down one of their bulldozers and started filling the dip at the rear end of the land with truckloads of soil, with the dozer fortuitously knocking down fences in the compound, the little demarcations made by the occupants.

The occupants’ kids had fun with the dozer, riding on it and generally rioting. He turned a blind eye to all this since he had achieved his objective. Once everyone was relocated, they developed the land and made it their haulage yard. Just two years later they developed the Peliyagoda property and moved the haulage yard to that location. Peliyagoda was more convenient, being close to the Colombo Port.

Once the yard was moved away from Kirula Road, the owners of Asiri Hospitals approached Nahil with a proposal to purchase the lot for the construction of a hospital, offering East West Holdings (EWH) shares in the hospital as an alternative to cash, pointing out that Nahil had doctors in his family. Just to get some kind of direction before he made a decision, Nahil phoned his doctor sisters, who let him know that they would not be settling in Sri Lanka. He opted for cash instead of shares which, if he had accepted, would have made him a substantial shareholder of Asiri Hospitals.

While the Maduru Oya freight was being transported from the port to the site, EWH was among the freight forwarders involved in the haulage of goods belonging to the contractors whom they worked with direct, avoiding involvement with subcontractors. One afternoon, the foreign contractors gathered at the Port on a day the Port was extremely busy, a buzz of activity going on with import of cranes, and other machinery, whilst nothing was branded or labeled.

Nahil informed them that he was expecting a shipment on a particular day and requested all their equipment to be mustered in their facility to enable the efficient transport of the goods, once the ship arrived. He had some machines in his lot which did not belong to EWH, though at a glance, it gave the impression to his foreign visitors that this huge fleet of machines belonged to them. This showcased their competition as physically depleted of goods. “Cheeky stuff,” says Nahil.
