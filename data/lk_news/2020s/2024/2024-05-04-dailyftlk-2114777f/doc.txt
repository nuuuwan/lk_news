India’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has invited representatives from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and United National Party (UNP) to observe the overall preparation and campaign of the party for the Lok Sabha elections.

Accordingly, UNP Young Professionals Organisation Head Sumudu Kekulandala and SLPP MP Nipuna Ranawaka are currently in India in response to the invitation.

The SLPP and the UNP are among eight political parties from ten countries that have received a special invitation from the ruling party.

The political party representatives received the opportunity to interact with a host of BJP leaders, including Party President J.P. Nadda and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, during their visit to India.

They are also expected to be given insights into the party’s election campaign and briefed about its strategies, as well as the overall electoral process.

BJP has also invited parties from Australia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Israel, Uganda, Tanzania, Russia, Nepal, and Mauritius for the event. According to BJP, the visit is part of the global outreach program titled ‘Know BJP’, which was launched last year.
