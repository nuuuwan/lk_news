Martis recommended for Head Coach position

Mar. 20 (Daily Mirror) - Former Isipathana College, CR and FC and national youth player, current St. Peterâ€™s College and CH and FC Head Coach, Sanath Martis was recommended by Sri Lanka Rugby (SLR) Technical Committee for the appointment as Head Coach of the Sri Lanka 15-A-Side outfit for the Asia Rugby Division 1 Series against the Qatar national outfit.

This tournament is likely to be played at the Racecourse Grounds in Colombo with the hosts playing two games against the visiting Qatar outfit as Pakistan is likely to pull out from the event due to political uncertainty.

The Technical Committee comprises Roshan Deen, Anil Jayasinghe, Tony Amit and Viper (Jnr.) Gunaratne with Tony Amit heading the unit.

According to sources, the committee has already sent their nomination to SLR Council, which will meet shortly to approve and the national selectors will name the initial squad for training.

Meanwhile, the Technical Committee had recommended Dushantha Lewke, the present Royal College and League Tournament winning unbeaten CR and FC Coach as their nomination for the forwards role.

In addition, Clifford Cup-winning Police SC Coach Nilfer Ibrahim has been recommended as the back division coach for this series, which is vital for Sri Lanka as the winner will play in the Asia Rugby Top Four series in 2025.
