Fairly heavy showers expected in parts of the island

Showers or thundershowers will occur over most parts of the Island during the afternoon or night, says the Meteorology Department.

Fairly heavy showers above 50 mm can be expected at some places in Eastern, Central, and North-central provinces, it said.

A few showers may occur in the coastal areas of Southern and Western provinces during the morning too.

The general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
