Farmers deserve an income that reflects their hard work, innovation, and dedication – Dilith

The presidential candidate of the ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ alliance, Dilith Jayaweera states that his national strategic plan includes a comprehensive plan to revamp the agricultural sector and significantly improve the lives and incomes of farmers.

Addressing a public rally held in Kaduruwela, Jayaweera emphasized the urgent need to address the ongoing struggles faced by farmers. He criticized the current system, which he claims benefits only a small segment of the population while leaving farmers to grapple with persistent hardships.

“Nearly 30 percent of our population is directly involved in agriculture, yet they continue to face severe challenges,” Jayaweera stated. “It is unjust that while only a few benefit, the majority of our farmers suffer. Our goal is to transition these farmers to a more lucrative model, enhancing their income while keeping them within the agricultural sector.”

Jayaweera outlined his strategic plan, stating “We have identified that the existing guaranteed price for crops is inadequate and needs to be revised. The government must regulate the market in a way that supports agriculture. Currently, the guaranteed price fails to address the economic realities of farmers, leaving them in debt and struggling to prepare for the next season.”

He questioned the viability of the current system, asking whether it is feasible for farmers to sell a kilo of paddy at the set price and still manage their expenses and preparations for future crops without falling further into financial difficulty.

“To remedy this, we must move away from the flawed concept of the guaranteed price and develop a fair agricultural system,” Jayaweera said, adding that “farmers deserve income that reflects their hard work, innovation, and dedication.”
