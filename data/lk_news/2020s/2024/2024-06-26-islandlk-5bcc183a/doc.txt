Let’s do it with Potatoes…

Hi! Since I haven’t given my readers any beauty tips, with the potato as the main base, I thought of bringing the potato into the scene this week.

What’s more, potatoes are freely available, so you won’t have any hassle going searching for this vegetable which is a favourite at most homes.

You will need 02 teaspoons potato juice, 02 teaspoons lemon juice and ½ teaspoon honey (optional)

Mix the potato and lemon juice and add honey to the mixture and blend well.

Apply it all over your face and neck and leave it on for 15 minutes and then wash it off with water.

(Do this very alternate day. By the way, dilute the lemon juice if you experience irritation)

You will need 01 tablespoon potato juice or pulp, 01 tablespoon tomato juice or pulp and 01 tablespoon honey.

Mix the potato and tomato juice/pulp and add the honey to the mixture and mix until you obtain a smooth paste.

Apply it evenly on your face, focusing on the affected area.

(Do this once a day until the acne vanishes. By the way, since tomato juice is highly acidic, it might dry out your skin. To prevent that, add another tablespoon of honey to the face mask.)

You will need 01 teaspoon potato juice, 01 teaspoon rice flour, 01 teaspoon lemon juice (optional) and 01 teaspoon honey

Mix all the ingredients into a thick paste and apply it on your face and neck and leave it to dry. Use water to scrub the dry face pack gently and then clean your face thoroughly, in a circular motion.

(Do this twice a week. By the way, dilute the lemon juice in case you have super sensitive skin as it might cause skin irritation.)

You will need 03 potatoes (boiled and peeled), 02 tablespoons milk, 01 tablespoon oatmeal and 01 teaspoon lemon juice.

Mash the potatoes in a bowl and add the other ingredients to it and mix well until you get a smooth paste.

Apply this paste on your face and leave it on for about 30 minutes and then wash it off with lukewarm water.

You will need 01 potato (chopped), 02 strawberries and ½ teaspoon honey.

Blend the potato and strawberries to make a paste, add the honey to it and apply this mixture to your face and neck, and wash it off after 15-20 minutes.
