Sri Lanka to issue on arrival driving license for foreigners from April: State Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has taken steps to issue licenses for foreigners on arrival at the airport from April and end a lengthy process to obtain them at the Department of Motor Traffic (DMT) in Colombo suburb, State Transport Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said.

The move could also help the island nation to earn foreign exchange for the service which it now provides for in local currency, two government official said.

Tourists who wish to drive within Sri Lanka should obtain a driving license by visiting the DMT at Werahera, a Colombo suburb amid heavy bureaucratic red tapes, tourist operators have said.

The Minister said around 3,500 foreigners annually visit Werahera to obtain their licenses.

“This is not a good situation. From April this year, we have taken steps to facilitate the issuance of driving licenses for foreigners at the airport itself when they arrive,” Alagiyawanna told reporters in Colombo at a media briefing on Wednesday (17).

Foreigners at the moment pay 30,000 Sri Lankan rupees to obtain a driving license in one-day service and 25,000 rupees in a normal service, the DMT data show.

Sri Lanka is in the process of maximizing its dollar earnings after an unprecedented economic crisis forced its government to declare bankruptcy and sovereign debt default in April 2023. (Colombo/Jan 17/2024)
