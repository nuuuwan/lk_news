Notice issued on functioning of schools tomorrow

The Ministry of Education states that schools across the island will function as usual tomorrow (June 24).

This was communicated in a statement issued by the Ministry of Education this afternoon (23).

However, the non-academic staff of the government schools have announced that they will launch a trade union action by reporting sick on Monday (24) and Tuesday (25), demanding a national policy for the non-academic service in the education sector.

Meanwhile, the university non-academic staff, who have been engaged in a strike action for over 50 days, state that the necessary written agreements to resolve their problems at the minimum level have been handed over to the State Minister of Higher Education.

The University Trade Union Joint Committee (UTUJC) stated that their strike action could be concluded tomorrow if the government provides a favourable response regarding the matter.
