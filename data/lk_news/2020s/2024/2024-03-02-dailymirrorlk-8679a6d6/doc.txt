Heat felt by human body raised to caution level in four provinces

The temperature felt on the human body is expected to increase up to ‘caution level’ at some places in Northwestern, Western, Southern and Sabaragamuwa Provinces and in Mannar District, according to the Department of Meteorology.

It means fatigue is possible in case of prolonged exposure to heat these days in these areas.

Also, heat cramps can result from continuing activity in the heat.

If it is raised to extreme caution level, heat cramps and heat exhaustion are possible. Continuing activity can lead to heat stroke.
