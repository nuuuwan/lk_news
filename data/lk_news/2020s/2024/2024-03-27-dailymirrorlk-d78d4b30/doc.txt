Keheliya’s daughter complains to HRCSL over father’s arrest

Colombo, March 27 (Daily Mirror)- Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella's daughter Chamithri Rambukwella lodged a complaint with the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) today claiming that her father's human rights have been violated due to his arbitrary arrest.

She told reporters outside the HRCSL that according to the legal principle of presumption of innocence, any person accused of any crime is considered innocent until proven guilty.

She said in normal practice, suspects are arrested only after concluding the investigations.

She said she hopes that the HRCSL will look into her complaint and mete out justice.
