Zesta Tea marks 25 years of brewing success in the Sri Lankan tea industry

Zesta Tea, a renowned flagship brand under Sunshine Consumer Lanka and Sri Lanka’s first brand to launch branded, export-quality tea for local tea lovers, recently marked its 25th anniversary by commemorating a legacy of quality, flavor and unmatched excellence in Sri Lanka’s tea industry. Held on the 17th of January 2024, the celebratory event brought together employees from Zesta and leadership of Sunshine Holdings PLC, as they marked a significant milestone in the brand’s journey.

Since its inception, Zesta has been synonymous with innovation, sophistication and an unwavering commitment to provide premium-quality tea to the Sri Lankan market. Emerging as a disruptor in 1998, Zesta challenged the prevailing notion that the finest teas were exclusively reserved for international markets and was the first to introduce a distinctive blend of 100% Broken Orange Pekoe Fannings (BOPF) to Sri Lankans. The brand’s visionary promise to provide Sri Lankans with the best quality tea laid the foundation in its journey to becoming a beloved household name, breaking away from conventions with bold communication strategies that won the hearts and minds of its consumers.
