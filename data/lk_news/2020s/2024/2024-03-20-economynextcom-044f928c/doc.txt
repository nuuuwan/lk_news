Sri Lanka ready to make ongoing reforms a law, minister tells IMF

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s State Minister of Finance has told Dr Krishnamurthy Subramanian, Executive Director of the IMF for India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bhutan that an election would not interrupt ongoing reforms.

“During the discussion ensured that the reforms implemented will not be disrupted with election been announced and the government is ready to make the ongoing reforms a law of the country which demonstrates the dedication to stability and sustainable growth,” Semasinghe said on X (twitter) after the meeting.

“Wide ranging topics were discussed around the current IMF programme and attention was paid to the challenges in digitizing the tax process and it was pointed out that the government has taken steps to increase the number of tax files, which had decreased due to various policy decisions, to approximately one million at present.”

Since 2024 is an election year the IMF was keen that there was no deviation from the principles of the program and “no hasty decisions” are taken, Minister Semasinghe said.

In a separate meeting with Dr Fergus Cumming, Deputy Chief Economist of the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office, and Andrew Patrick, British High Commissioner in Sri Lanka, Semasinghe said they examined the outcomes of the IMF program and discussed reforms extending beyond the program’s scope. “The emphasis was placed on the significance of maintaining momentum with reforms. Furthermore, views were exchanged on enhancing tax administration practices.” (Colombo/Mar20/2024)
