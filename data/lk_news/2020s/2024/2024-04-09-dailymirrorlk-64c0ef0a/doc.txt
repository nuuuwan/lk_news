Government to upgrade Hingurakgoda airport to international hub

Colombo, April 9 (Daily Mirror0 - The government has decided to upgrade the Hingurakgoda domestic airport, the oldest airport in the country, into an international air hub.

Originally built as the Minneriya Air Force Centre (RAF Minneriya) during World War II by England's Royal Air Force, the airport's transformation into an international facility is now a priority for the country's economy, as directed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

To kickstart this initiative, the government has allocated Rs. 2 billion in the 2024 budget for the initial construction and development. This funding will be used to extend the current 2,287 metres long and 46 metres wide runway to 2,500 metres in the first phase.

Upon completion of this runway expansion, the airport will be capable of accommodating aircraft such as the Airbus 320 and Boeing B737. The overall development project is estimated to cost approximately Rs. 17 billion, with all construction activities being managed by the Sri Lankan Air Force.

Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva recently conducted an inspection visit to assess the upcoming development work at the Hingurakgoda Airport. Following this visit, a special discussion was held at the Air Force Base to address construction-related matters.
