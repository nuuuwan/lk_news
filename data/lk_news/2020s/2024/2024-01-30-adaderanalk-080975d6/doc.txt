SJB’s planned rally slapped with yet another court order

The anti-government protest march organized by the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) to be staged in Colombo this afternoon has been slapped with yet another court order.

This is the third court order imposed on the main opposition’s planned rally.

It was delivered by Maligakanda Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court against 16 SJB members including Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, MP Ranjith Madduma Bandara, MP S.M. Marikkar, MP Kabir Hashim, former MP Mujibur Rahman, MP Harshana Rajakaruna, MP Sarath Fonseka, MP Tissa Attanayake, MP Lakshman Kiriella, MP Hesha Vithanage, MP Kavinda Jayawardena, former MP Hirunika Premachandra and around 500 supporters, after taking into account a request made by the OIC of Maradana Police.

The protesters are barred from causing inconveniences to motorists and pedestrians travelling along Dean’s Road, Lipton Roundabout, Maradana Junction, T.B. Jayah Mawatha, Olcott Mawatha, the Technical Junction and other areas in Colombo this evening.

The court order further reads that the protesters are, however, allowed to use the P.D. Sirisena Ground and Hyde Park to stage their demonstration.

The first order came from the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court, which prevented the SJB members and supporters from inconveniencing the public and pedestrians in parts of the Maligawatta police area during the rally.

The second order was issued by Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court SJB supporters from entering parts of Colombo including the Finance Ministry, the Presidential Secretariat, the President’s House and Galle Face Green.
