Bribery Commission warns against misuse of state property

The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) has issued a directive to return government property if it is being misused.

In a statement, the commission said it has received numerous complaints that immovable and movable properties provided by the government to individuals holding official positions were being used unlawfully even after those positions had been vacated.

As a result, the relevant authorities are instructed to take immediate steps to reclaim such properties.

The CIABOC has issued this notice to Ministry Secretaries, Provincial Chief Secretaries, Heads of Local Government Bodies, Department Heads, District Secretaries, and the Heads of Statutory Bodies affiliated with the government.

According to Sections 41 and 111 of the Anti-Corruption Act, failing to return such property to the government is a punishable offence under the law, it warned.
