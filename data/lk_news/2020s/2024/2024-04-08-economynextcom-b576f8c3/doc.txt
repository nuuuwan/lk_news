Not a dry holiday for Sri Lanka’s foreign visitors

ECONOMYNEXT – Liquor will be available for tourists staying in boutique villas and three-star and above hotels licensed by the Tourism Development Authority during the upcoming holiday period, the Department of Excise has said.

But “All excise licensed pubs should be closed for retail sale of liquor,” the Commissioner General of Excise said in statement released by the Department of Government Information.

Sri Lanka usually prohibits the sale of liquor during holidays.

The Excise Department has requested the public to report any complaints during this period via telephone number 1913.
