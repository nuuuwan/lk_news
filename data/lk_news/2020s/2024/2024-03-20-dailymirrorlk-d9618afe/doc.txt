Amid election fever a dark horse rises - EDITORIAL

Polls fever in the country is heating up. Yet, ‘we the people’ are not certain whether the poll would be for a general election, presidential poll or whether a poll will be held at all. Our constitution however, dictates a presidential election is due during the fourth quarter of the year.

One thing seems certain; we still see the same faces who played a major role in bankrupting the country, putting themselves forward to lead us and our country into new vistas of prosperity.

While political parties are busy blaming each other for bringing this country to a state of bankruptcy, we do not hear any one of them raising a hand and saying ‘mea maxima culpa’ – through my most grievous fault or even saying ‘I am sorry’. Rather, we are being treated to a number of political dramas.

Our immediate past president -Gotabaya Rajapaksa- launched a supposed tell-all book ‘Conspiracy’ claiming his downfall was brought about by a ‘foreign hand’. He conveniently forgets the highest court of this land had already found him, his brother Mahinda and top officials of his regime “demonstrably contributed” to the 2022 economic crisis and “violated public trust”.

While absolving himself of all blame, ex president Gotabaya did not provide any names or a shred of evidence of the foreign hand he claimed played a decisive role in toppling his regime. With elections on the cards we also witnessed the return of the SLPP strongman and founder Basil Rajapaksa from the US.

In a surprising turn of events, in an interview with a private television station, Basil confirmed the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) did not possess a candidate who could contest the upcoming presidential election. Rather he confirmed, current President Ranil Wickremesinghe was by far the best prospect for the post of president.

The founder of the SLPP has however called for the holding of a general election prior to a presidential poll. There has been speculation of ongoing talks between the president and the SLPP founder. But as yet, there has been no confirmation that the SLPP will back a bid by Wickremesinhe for the post of president.

President Wickremesinghe, though not confirming he would be contesting the presidential poll, has been nominated by his party to contest the presidential election.

Meanwhile Sagala Ratnayake National Organiser of the United National Party (UNP) and National Security Advisor to President Wickremesinghe also launched a book ‘Prez vs the Press’ -a collection of political cartoons lampooning Wickremesinghe- by various cartoonists.

In a break with protocol, the past president was not seated next to President Wickremesinghe. Sadly Mahindha Rakapaksa was cast aside, all by his lonesome self, among other front benchers. None of the speakers even referred to the ex President’s presence in the audience. It was only President Wickremesinghe himself who made reference to ex President Rajapaksa being in the auditorium.

Also in the running is the Samagi Jana Balawegaya led by Sajith Premadasa son of former late President Ranasinghe Premadasa. The party seems to be at war with itself and will need to haul itself up its bootstraps if it is going to give the incumbent president a run for his money.

Meanwhile the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) led by former president Sirisena appears to be a no-hoper. The Muslim political parties have let down their constituents so often, many Muslim voters are moving toward the national political parties.

Of this milieu of political party hopefuls, a dark horse has emerged. The National People’s Power (NPP) - a coalition of political forces supportive of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake is hogging the headlines in social and mainstream media.

The NPP is presenting itself as the only political party not stained by corruption. The party has also won the backing of a large percentage of the Muslim community, and the young eligible voters among the Sinhalese.

However, the JVP does not have a support-base among the Tamil constituency -both upcountry and northeastern. These votes will be necessary for an outright victory at both the presidential and parliamentary elections. With three or more Sinhala parties fighting for the Sinhala vote, the minority vote will be of vital importance.
