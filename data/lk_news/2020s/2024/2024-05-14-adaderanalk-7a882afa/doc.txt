Heavy showers of about 100mm expected in several provinces

Due to a low-level atmospheric disturbance in the vicinity of Sri Lanka, showery conditions are expected to continue further, says the Meteorology Department.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places in most provinces of the island after 1.00 p.m.

Heavy showers of about 100mm are likely at some places in Southern, Central, Eastern and Uva provinces, it said.

Showers may occur at Western and Southern provinces during the morning too.

General public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
