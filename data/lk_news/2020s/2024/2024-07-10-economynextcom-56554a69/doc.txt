ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s State Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya has said that the final decision regarding the lifting of the ban on vehicle imports will be taken in the second week of August.

The Minister said he hoped to be able to import vehicles depending on the country’s exchange rate status and the priority of people’s needs.

Public transport vehicles, goods transport vehicles, and private vehicles will be imported under the regulations.

Although the Cabinet had approved the import of 1,000 vehicles (250 buses and 750 vans) to be used in the tourism sector, none have been imported so far, Siyambalapitiya said. (Colombo/Jul10/2024)
