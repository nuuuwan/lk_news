Govt. pledges continuity on key welfare and housing initiatives

The Government on Tuesday announced that it will continue several key initiatives started by the previous administration, including the social welfare programs Aswesuma and Urumaya as well as housing projects for estate workers.

Speaking at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Vijitha Herath confirmed that the Government is committed to maintaining and expanding these programs.

“Aswesuma, which provides financial assistance to low-income families and Urumaya, freehold land distribution program will both remain active under the new administration,” he stressed.

Herath also said the Social Security Ministry has appointed a committee of experts to address grievances faced by beneficiaries of the Aswesuma, following complaints reported during inquires conducted by District and Divisional Secretariats.

“The committee will investigate cases where previous Samurdhi beneficiaries lost access to Aswesuma benefits. The committee’s task is to review these cases and prepare a report on any identified injustices,” he explained.

The initiative was established to ensure more effective and inclusive support for vulnerable populations. Its primary objective is to provide financial aid to deserving individuals and families facing economic hardships.

In addition to these two initiatives, he said ongoing housing initiatives designed to improve living conditions for estate workers and the rooftop solar panel system for religious places will be rolled out without hindrance.

“A total of 249 such houses will be handed over today (8),” he added.

He underscored the Government’s approach to building on past efforts to ensure continuity in social welfare and development, aiming to benefit communities that have consistently faced economic and social challenges.
