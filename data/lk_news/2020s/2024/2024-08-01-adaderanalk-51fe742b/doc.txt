‘Sri Lanka’s agreement will be revised under a future mandate’ – Sajith tells IMF team

Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa states that he informed the International Monetary Fund (IMF) representatives that Sri Lanka’s agreement with the global lender would be revised under a future mandate.

The Opposition Leader made this statement during a meeting with the executive committee of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA).

The newly-elected executive committee of the GMOA met with Sajith Premadasa today at the Opposition Leader’s Office.

A delegation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) headed by Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka Peter Breuer arrived in the island recently to hold discussions with regard to the progress Sri Lanka has achieved under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme which was approved to the island nation in March last year.

The visiting IMF staff mission also held discussions with Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa on Wednesday (July 31).
