Sri Lanka public transport to get e-ticketing by end-2024: Official

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s public transport fares will move to an e-ticket system by the end of this year, a senior transport official has said.

“An electronic ticketing system for public transport services, including trains, will be introduced before the end of the year,” Secretary of the Ministry of Transport and Highways, RG Rubasinghe told reporters on Monday.

Sri Lanka has been talking of moving to an e-ticketing for state buses to stop revenue theft by bus conductors.

“Some conductors take a portion of the money home,” Minister of Transport Bandula Gunawardana told reporters earlier this year.

“The take home amount is 10 million rupees daily, or 100 lakhs, which together becomes 3 billion a year.

Gunawardana said there was opposition from transportation workers with some of them taking the matter to court.

A recent reduction in bus fares saw the minimum fare reduced from 30 rupees to 28. But since most passengers don’t carry coins, the exact fare cannot be paid. Conductors are not forthcoming with change money, so passengers forfeit

“Every day, our buses serve around 1.2 million passengers through 5,500 trips,” Chairman of Ceylon Transport Board, Lalith de Alwis said. “With a strategic focus on digitization, we aim to completely eliminate revenue losses.”

“Our upcoming initiatives include the introduction of electric buses to enhance innovation in public transport, leveraging modern technology to streamline fleet operations and improve passenger information services.”

“Passengers already benefit from online seat reservations and access to long-distance service timetables via the internet. We are planning to roll out further digital services in the near future.”

After Sri Lanka’s economic crisis, many global institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), have strongly recommended the Sri Lankan government to fully digitalise its transactions to reduce human interventions and eventually corruption. (Colombo/Jul8/2023)
