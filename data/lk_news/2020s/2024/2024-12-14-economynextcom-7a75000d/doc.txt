European Union allocates 175,000 euros for Sri Lankans affected by floods

ECONOMYNEXT – The European Union is allocating 175,000 euros (53.8 million rupees) to provide emergency humanitarian assistance to people affected by cyclone Fengal across Sri Lanka.

The funding will benefit over 37,000 people in some of the hardest-hit areas in the eastern and northern provinces, EU in Sri Lanka said in a statement.

This EU funding will support the Sri Lanka Red Cross in delivering assistance to address the basic needs of people who have lost their homes or livelihoods.

Funded activities include the distribution of essential household items, school supplies and cash grants to the most vulnerable families.

There will be also cleaning campaigns and actions to prevent possible outbreaks of diseases such as dengue.

The funding is part of the EU’s overall contribution to the Disaster Response Emergency Fund (IFRC-DREF) of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

It comes in addition to contributions of 350,000 euros earlier this year, following previous floods in the country.

Cyclone Fengal caused heavy rains and very strong winds, damaging homes, infrastructures, and livelihoods. Water and sanitation facilities are compromised by the flooding in the most affected districts. (Colombo/Dec14/2024)
