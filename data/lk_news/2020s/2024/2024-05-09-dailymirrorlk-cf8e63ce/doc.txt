I am coming back, says Diana

Colombo, May 09 (Daily Mirror) - Former State Minister Diana Gamage, whose parliamentary seat was recently declared illegal by the Supreme Court over her citizenship issue, expressed her determination to return to the political arena.

"I am coming back to politics. I will not leave the country," Gamage asserted, dismissing any notion of retreat despite the legal setback.

Emphasizing her adherence to the law, Gamage told a news briefing today (09) that â€œI respect the law. However, I will prove my innocence," she affirmed.

Gamage also accused the opposition leader of lacking respect for women.

Despite the legal and personal challenges she faces, Gamage pledged her ongoing support for Ranil Wickremesinghe's political journey, indicating her commitment to the political faction led by Wickremesinghe.
