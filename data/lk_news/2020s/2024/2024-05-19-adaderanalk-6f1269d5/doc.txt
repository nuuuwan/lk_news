Showery and windy conditions expected to enhance further

Due to pre-monsoonal conditions over the country and surrounding sea areas, prevailing showery and windy conditions are expected to enhance further during the next few days, according to the Meteorology Department.

Cloudy skies can be expected over most parts of the island, it said.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central, North-western and Southern provinces and in Mannar district.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places elsewhere of the island after 01.00 p.m.

Heavy showers above 100mm are likely at some places in Western, Sabaragamuwa and North-western provinces and in Galle, Matara, Kandy, Nuwara-Eliya and Mannar districts.

Fairly strong winds about 30-40 kmph can be expected at times in Southern province, the department said.

General public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
