Met. Dept. issues ‘red alert’ for strong winds and rough seas

The Department of Meteorology has issued a ‘Red’ alert for strong winds and rough seas for Naval and Multi-day Fisherman communities in the Arabian Sea.

Very strong winds of 70-80kmph, and very rough seas are likely over Arabian Sea area (in sea areas bounded by (07N - 20N) and (55E – 68E)) due to the active south-west monsoonal condition, the department warned.

Furthermore, the department advised the naval and fishing communities not to venture into the sea areas marked in red on the map until further notice.  Those already in these regions should return to the coast or move to safer areas immediately.

The general public, along with the fishing and naval communities, are urged to take precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.

Additionally, they are requested to stay attentive to future forecasts issued by the Department of Meteorology.
