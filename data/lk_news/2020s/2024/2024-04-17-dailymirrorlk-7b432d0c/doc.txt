Child diarrhoea on the rise

Colombo, April 16 (Daily Mirror) -  Health officials have noticed significant prevalence of diarrhoeal disease among children these days, urging parents to exercise caution.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) consultant pediatrician Dr. Deepal Perera said “It is a normal scenario to witness an uptick in cases of child diarrhoea following the extended holidays since children tend to consume more food from outside sources.’’

The symptoms include frequent loose or watery stools, abdominal pain or cramps, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting.

“If these symptoms are visible in their children, parents are urged to immediately take their children for medical care.”

Furthermore, parents are advised to be more vigilant about what they feed their children with.

Meanwhile, the pediatrician cautioned of the prevalence of Typhoid fever among children.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diarrhoeal disease is the second leading cause of death in children under five years of age.
