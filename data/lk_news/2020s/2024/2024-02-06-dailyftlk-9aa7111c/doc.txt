National People’s Party (NPP) and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake met with Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval in Delhi yesterday.

Dissanayake along with a delegation of NPP politicians are currently on an official visit to India at the invitation of the Indian Government. The delegation includes NPP General Secretary Dr. Nihal Abeysinghe and NPP National Executive Members Prof. Anil Jayantha and MP Vijitha Herath.

Dissanayake is scheduled for a five-day visit to India, encompassing three cities – New Delhi, Ahmedabad, and Thiruvananthapuram, as reported by the Indian media.

Taking to X (formerly Twitter) Jaishankar said the discussion between the duo centred on enhancing the bilateral relationship and exploring the mutual benefits that could arise from its further strengthening. He further noted that their conversation encompassed discussions on Sri Lanka’s economic challenges and the potential trajectory moving forward.

Meanwhile, Dissanayake also met with National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval at Sardar Patel Bhavan in New Delhi. The NPP said security and bilateral issues concerning India and Sri Lanka were discussed at the high-level meeting.

The invitation extended by the Indian Government signals an acknowledgement of the recent opinion polls favouring Dissanayake and his growing popularity in Sri Lanka, especially during an election year. Notably, many diplomats from various countries have engaged in a series of meetings with leaders of the National People’s Force (NPP) in recent times including US Ambassador Julie Chung.
