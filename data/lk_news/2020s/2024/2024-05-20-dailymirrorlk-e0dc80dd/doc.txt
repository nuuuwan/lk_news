Chief prelates urge Presidential pardon for Ven. Gnanasara Thera on Vesak Poya day

Colombo, May 20 (Daily Mirror) - Recognising the efforts of Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galaboda Atte Gnanasara Thera in promoting national unity and social support, the Chief Prelates of the Malwathu, Asgiri, Ramanna Nikaya, and the Amarapura Maha Sangha Sabha have appealed to the President to grant Ven. Gnanasara Thera a pardon on Vesak Poya day.

In a letter to the President, the Chief Prelates noted that Ven. Galaboda Atte Gnanasara Thera was sentenced to four years in prison on March 28, 2024, after being found guilty of causing discord during a media discussion about the Kooragala Rajamaha Vihara in 2016.

Ven. Gnanasara Thero has also taken steps to alert authorities about extremist activities in society.

His actions provided crucial support to state security forces, helping to prevent the spread of some extremist groups in Sri Lanka.

As a result, several potential extremist conflicts in Sri Lankan society were averted, they claimed.
