Bus strike on 138 Kadawatha–Pettah route

The commuters traveling on the 138 route have experienced significant difficulties owing to the strike launched by the private bus operators on the Kadawatha – Pettah route (138), who have withdrawn from passenger transport services since this morning (31).

Accordingly, all the private bus operators on the Kadawatha – Pettah, Weliweriya – Pettah and Pettah - Kirillawala routes have withdrawn from passenger transport service since this morning.

Reportedly, several buses belonging to the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) were deployed promptly to ease the situation that had arisen due to the ongoing strike.

The bus owners on the 138 route stressed that their income has been greatly affected by the granting of permission for several new buses to operate on the Kiribathgoda - Pettah route.

They also expressed their concerns about the significant muddy pothole at the Kadawatha Bus Stand, which is causing damage to their buses and also highlighted the unpleasant smells in the area due to overflowing toilet pits at the bus stand.

The bus drivers emphasized that they initiated the strike demanding solutions to the relevant issues and if their concerns are not addressed, they will continue to withdraw from passenger transport services.

As a result, the passengers on the route have faced several difficulties due to the ongoing bus strike.
