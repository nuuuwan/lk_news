His invitation to this high-profile conference underscores his commitment to robust evaluation systems that can drive sustainable development and social inclusion.

“I am honoured to be a panellist at this significant international event,” he said. “Responsive evaluation is vital in shaping effective public policies that are inclusive and future-focused, especially in today’s rapidly evolving world. I look forward to sharing insights and learning from global experiences as we work towards achieving the SDGs.”

The NEC Conference 2024 is expected to draw participation from senior government officials, evaluation units, ministries, national statistical agencies, and supreme audit institutions from across the globe. Attendees will also include representatives from civil society, academia, the private sector, UN agencies, and other international development partners.
