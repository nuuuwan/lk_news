Sri Lanka’s Hunas Holdings to offer room nights trading with Japan firm

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Hunas Holdings, which has interests in leisure and energy, said it is partnering with Japan-based BCC Corporation to offer a platform that allows people to buy and sell hotel rooms.

Rooms booked through its platform named Nafutel, could be sold to another traveller, if travel plans change and cut their loss risk.

“In the event of unforeseen circumstances preventing them from utilizing their booked dates, travelers have the option to sell their room reservations on the platform, effectively recouping their investment,” Hunas Holdings said in a statement.

Investors who want to take on risk could also book rooms ahead of time at cheaper rates and try to sell them at higher rates, when prices rise by taking trading positions.

“By purchasing room nights ahead of time, investors can capitalize on fluctuating demand in the hospitality industry, strategically upselling their reservations during peak seasons for maximum returns,” the firm said.

“Through the Nafutel platform, we are empowering travelers with unparalleled flexibility while offering a lucrative investment avenue for discerning stakeholders,” Dhanuka Samarasinghe, Chairman Hunas Holdings Plc said in the statement.

The system was jointly developed by SBCC Pte Ltd of Singapore, a subsidiary of BCC Corporation and Hunas Holdings. It will use blockchain and non-fungible token (NFT) technology.

“The Nafutel platform represents the convergence of innovation and opportunity,” Nagata Tetsuji, President BCC Corporation said.

The two firms said the partnership was aiming to “reshape the landscape of the hospitality industry” with the room night trading platform. (Colombo/Apr18/2024)
