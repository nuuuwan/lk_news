International Industry Expo 2024 in June

In anticipation of the upcoming industry exhibition, the “International Industry Expo 2024”, excitement is building as less than two months are left until the exciting event unfolds. Recognised as the largest South Asian industry exhibition of the year covering a wide range of industries, International Industry Expo 2024 is poised to bring together diverse participants from all over the country under one roof at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) from 19 to 23 June 2024.

With over 1,300 exhibition stalls representing 25 industrial sectors, the exhibition offers a rich tapestry of experiences designed to inspire, educate, and facilitate vibrant displays of cutting-edge technology, interactive demos, and meaningful connections directly with manufacturers.

“Industry Expo 2024 is committed to providing local industrialists, attendees, sponsors, and international buyers with the opportunity to explore the latest genuine product innovations of Sri Lanka, unparalleled opportunities for networking and collaboration, and discover exclusive quality and cost-competitive deals with trustworthy Sri Lankan suppliers,” says Industries Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana.

Under the purview of the Ministry of Industries of Sri Lanka, the Industry Development Board (IDB) is organising the International Industry Expo 2024 to demonstrate the status and future potentials of the Sri Lankan industrial sector and envisage the strategic success of the exhibition as the empowerment of entrepreneurial mindset in Sri Lankan society to opening the gateway for budding entrepreneurs to step into the global market arena and thereby uplift the country towards an export-oriented manufacturing economy.

The exhibition is accompanied by a locally assembled vehicle parade and provides a significant platform for industrialists to represent their creativity and novelty to a broader audience encouraging them to understand and become confident about the prospective local and international markets. The exhibition stimulates academic, organisational, and individual researchers to enhance their engagement in research commercialisation by organising “Innovation Arena 2024”, a special segment to unlock untapped market opportunities. In the innovation arena of 2024, school children are given a special focus on providing the necessary motivation to become industrial entrepreneurs through the experience they gained by school industry entrepreneurial circles that infused entrepreneurship into primary and secondary levels of education.

Industrialists who participate in the exhibition receive the opportunity to share the existing knowledge in their sectors to fill the technological gaps in local manufacturing and to discuss and identify the challenges in sustaining a business and solutions for resolving or mitigating them through B2B meetings. There are B2C meetings planned to focus intently on making customers feel wanted and appreciated.

One of the International Industry Expo 2024 highlights is the chance to learn from over 25 top industry leaders through industry seminars. These sessions cover various topics, from emerging trends and innovations to best practices and strategies for success in today’s dynamic marketplace. Attendees can gain constructive ideas and valuable insights to shape their business strategies and propel them toward sustainable growth and prosperity. Underscoring the green technologies that promote the use of renewable resources, conserve the use of energy and natural resources, encourage a healthy and improved environment for all forms of lives, zero greenhouse gas emissions, and minimise the degradation of the environment with the theme: “Go Green Industry”, the 1st International Symposium on Green Industry Initiative for Sustainable Industrial Development – 2024 (“ISGSD 2024”) is also planned as an event parallel to the International Industry Expo -2024. This provides an excellent opportunity for academia to showcase their research interests and outcomes. The best research and case studies will be honoured at the International Industry Expo – 2024 Green Awards.

Not only this, IDB has set strategic targets to hold the National Industry Brand Excellence Award Ceremony in parallel to the exhibition. The most excellent brands among Small, Medium & Large scale industries covering 25 industry sectors will be awarded.

Industrial Development Board Chairman Dr. Saranga Alahapperuma said the International Industry Expo 2024 is a strategic driver to accelerate the local manufacturing sector where the country can develop insights and values to face global challenges as development of the manufacturing sector is the green light for the growth and development of our country.

Dr. Alahapperuma further says “We were born in a developing country which is not our fault but if we cannot attain the developed state in our lifetime, it is our fault. We have the power to create a change and strive for improvement, both for ourselves and for the communities we are part of. I hope this exhibition will serve as an important part of our journey of building Sri Lanka into a wealthy nation”.
