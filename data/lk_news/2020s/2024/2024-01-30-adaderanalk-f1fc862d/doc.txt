Heavy traffic in Colombo due to SJB protest march

Traffic congestion is reported in Town Hall, Colombo, due to a protest march by the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), Ada Derana correspondent says.

Joined by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, SJB MPs and supporters, it was organized in protest of the conduct of the government.

Earlier today, three court orders were issued ahead of the SJB’s protest march, barring the demonstrators from entering certain locations in Colombo including the Finance Ministry, the Presidential Secretariat, the President’s House and Galle Face Green.

They are also banned from causing inconveniences to motorists and pedestrians travelling along Dean’s Road, Lipton Roundabout, Maradana Junction, T.B. Jayah Mawatha, Olcott Mawatha, the Technical Junction and other areas in Colombo this evening.

A court order further read that the protesters are, however, allowed to use the P.D. Sirisena Ground and Hyde Park to stage their demonstration.
