Cabinet approves basic salary increase for public servants from 2025

The Chairman of the expert committee on public service salary disparities, Mr. Udaya Seneviratna, announced that the Cabinet has approved a basic salary increase for all public servants from January 2025.

He stated that the salary increase ranges from 24% for lower grades and 24% to 50%+ for higher positions, based on qualifications, experience, and current roles, the President’s Media Division (PMD) reported.

Due to current inflation and economic conditions, Mr. Seneviratna announced that the Cabinet has approved increasing the cost of living allowance to Rs. 25,000 for all public servants starting January 2025.

Last week, the Cabinet of Ministers granted approval for the proposed salary revisions across all sectors of the public service.

An expert committee, chaired by former Presidential Secretary Udaya Seneviratne, was previously appointed to prepare a report with recommendations for implementing these proposals in the 2025 budget.

The committee engaged with major professional associations of public officials and the broader public sector, analyzed relevant data, and finalized the report.

Based on its recommendations, the Cabinet had approved the President’s proposal to include these salary revisions in the 2025 Budget.
