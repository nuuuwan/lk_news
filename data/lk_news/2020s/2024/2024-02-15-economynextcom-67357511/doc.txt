Sri Lanka restructuring unit extends Litro Gas bid deadline

ECONOMYNEXT – The bid deadline for Litro Gas Lanka Limited and Litro Gas Terminal Lanka (Private Limited) has been extended, the State Owned Enterprises Restructuring Unit of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Finance said.

In January, the Government called for expressions of interest for the state-owned gas company to be submitted by February 16. This has been extended to March 1, 2024, SOERU told prospective bidders.

“In relation to the Request for Expression of Interest (“REOI”) dated January 16 2024, to amend certain provisions of the REOI,” the SOERU said on social media platform X (twitter), on Thursday (15), publishing an amendment to the original bid document.

The government has 99.93 percent of the shares of the company, the largest supplier of cooking gas in the country, through Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, and four workers have the balance. (Colombo/Feb15/2024)
