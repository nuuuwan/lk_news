The Embassy of the Republic of Korea and the National Institute for International Education of Korea in collaboration with the Ministry of Education of Sri Lanka will host its first ever “2024 Study in Korea Education Fair” paving way for Sri Lankan students to explore opportunities for higher studies in Korea.

It will be held on Sunday 30 June and Monday 1 July from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Trace Expert City, Maradana, Colombo 10.  11 Korean universities will come to Sri Lanka to participate in the Education Fair on the above dates at the Trace Expert City, Colombo 10. At the same time, for those who are not able to come, the online education fair will be held with the participation of 30 universities until Tuesday 2 July via the official website ‘studyinkorea.go.kr’.

The opening ceremony on Sunday at 10 a.m. will be graced by Republic of Korea Ambassador Miyon Lee, and Education Minister Susil Premajayantha.

Students hoping to study in Korean universities will be able to explore individual university booths and receive personalised consultations such as admission information, academic programs and scholarships. Participants will also enjoy various side events like “Study in KoreaTalk concert” where Sri Lankan graduates from Korean universities will narrate their real life experiences. “Taste of Korean Street  Food” booth will provide popular Korean street food prepared by a Korean chef as well as various kinds of Korean snacks. The Republic of Korea and Sri Lanka share years of cooperation in many sectors, and education has become one of the most prominent areas on which the two countries have collaborated.

Renewing this bilateral relationship, the Korean Government believes this education fair will reward the students with a novel experience and make another chapter of educational cooperation between Korea and Sri Lanka.
