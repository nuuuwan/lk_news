In a post on his official social media accounts this morning, the President said: “Today, I lay out my manifesto to rebuild our country. I promise only what I can deliver, and I will do my best for our nation in the next five years. I will rebuild this country, and the next five years will be a triumphant time for Sri Lanka.”

The website www.ranil2024.lk, which features the manifesto of President Ranil Wickremesinghe who is running as an independent candidate in the upcoming presidential election, was also launched during the ceremony today.

In his policy statement, President Wickremesinghe outlines the priorities of the five-year plan: easing the cost of living, creating jobs, offering tax relief, promoting economic growth and implementing the ‘Aswesuma’ and ‘Urumaya’ programs.

As the first step, 100,000 new sources of employment will be created, thereby expanding the job market. Additionally, the manifesto mentioned that new income generation opportunities will be developed.
