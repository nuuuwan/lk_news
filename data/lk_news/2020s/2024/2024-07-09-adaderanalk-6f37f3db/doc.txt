Train operations on Coastal Line disrupted due to derailment

The train operations on the Coastal Line have been completely disrupted owing to the derailment of a train near Colombo Fort railway station.

Two compartments of a slow train plying from Panadura to Colombo Fort have derailed near Colombo Fort railway station this morning (09), blocking both railway tracks on the Coastal Line, the Department of Railways said.

As a result, the trains operating from Galle towards Colombo Fort and Maradana have been limited to Kompanna Veediya railway station, according to the department.

However, it has been reported that restoration work on the railway tracks has not yet commenced. As a result, it will take a few more hours for train operations to return to normal.
