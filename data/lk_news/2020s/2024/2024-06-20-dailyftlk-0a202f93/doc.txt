Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lanka President Keerthi Gunawardane

The Merchants’ Chamber of Commerce & Industry (MCCI), in collaboration with the Ministry of MSME, Government of India, has extended an invitation to Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lanka President Keerthi Gunawardane, to speak at the MCCI MSME International Conference 2024. This prestigious event will be held on 27 June at 10:30 a.m. at the Dhono Dhanyo Auditorium in Kolkata.

The conference, themed “Empowering MSMEs for Sustainable Development,” coincides with World MSME Day, as designated by the United Nations General Assembly. This day celebrates the vital role of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and raises awareness of their substantial contributions to the global economy.

Globally, MSMEs account for up to 90% of businesses, 60% to 70% of jobs, and half of global GDP, according to UN data. In India, MSMEs employ over 110 million people across 63 million businesses, contributing nearly 33% to the country’s GDP and 49% to its exports.

The conference aims to highlight the significant role of the MSME sector in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and to recognise their contribution to the global economy. Key objectives include advocating for policies that support MSME growth, creating market opportunities both domestically and globally, encouraging innovation, and providing networking and mentoring opportunities for MSMEs.

Gunawardane’s participation as an international resource person and special guest underscores the collaborative spirit and shared goals of fostering MSME growth and sustainable development across the region. His insights and experience will greatly enrich the discussions and deliberations at the conference.

The MCCI MSME International Conference 2024 will bring together industry experts, policymakers, and MSME stakeholders from India and neighbouring countries to strategise on empowering MSMEs and accelerating their growth.
