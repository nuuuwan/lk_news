ChatGPT was down for hours, now recovered

ChatGPT has now recovered from what OpenAI described as a "major outage" earlier today, which hit millions of users of worldwide.

Reports of the ChatGPT issues first started at around 2.30am ET / 7.30am BDT / 4.30pm AEST on June 4. OpenAI acknowledged that there was a big issue, with the company's status page reporting for several hours that "ChatGPT is unavailable for some users".

Fortunately, OpenAI pushed out a fix at around 7.30am ET / 12.30pm BST / 4.30pm AEST, and the service's status is now a healthier green color with "all systems operational". The problems were pretty widespread, both geographically and across platforms, hitting the web version, mobile app and new Mac app â€“ although they mostly appeared to affect logged in users.

OpenAI hasn't yet commented on what exactly caused ChatGPT's biggest outage of 2024, but we've asked it for comment and will update this page when we hear back.
