Damitha and her husband further remanded

Actress Damitha Abeyratne and her husband, who were arrested over alleged fraud, have been further remanded on the orders of Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court.

Accordingly, the couple will be behind bars on remand until 24 April.

The actress and her spouse, who had been wanted by the CID, were arrested after they appeared before the court on 04 April.

The CID is investigating Abeyratne and her husband, in connection with their involvement in an alleged money scam.

The Computer Crimes Division of the CID initiated an investigation into the alleged defrauding of Rs. 3 million by the couple on the promise of employment in South Korea. Subsequently, the CID informed the court that Abeyratne and her husband would be named as suspects of the relevant case.

Fort Magistrate’s Court also rejected a writ petition looking to prevent their arrest.
