Overhead bridge being used for multiple purposes

The mini-overhead bridge (over the railway line) connecting Jayantha Weerasekara Mawatha (Drieberg’s Avenue) and Sri Vajiragnana Road (Dematagoda Road) has become a garbage dumping site with all sorts of garbage thrown all over (vide photographs attached) and in a very much dilapidated state. This bridge provides easy access to Rajapokuna Mawatha, Maligawatta through Qurashana Mowlana Lane from Dematagoda.

Some of the overhead bridges have become public toilets – smelling of urine and human excreta. Overhead has also become make-shift homes for beggars, trade stalls for hawkers to sell their merchandise, etc.

Most of these bridges require renovation and/or regular maintenance as there is growth of weeds here and there, railings are corroded requiring painting, floor surface is broken, cracks on the steps and being ill-lit making it unsafe for the users during night time and moreover, making it more conducive for nefarious activities!

Over to the Colombo Municipal Council/Railways for immediate action. The National Dengue Control Unit of the Ministry of Health also should take adequate steps to prevent these becoming breeding sites for mosquitos.
