UKâ€™s York St. John University offers instant admission at ICFS event

Colombo, Feb 29 (Daily MiAn exclusive admission event organized by ICFS (International Center for Foreign Studies) in collaboration with UK's York St. John University is scheduled to take place on Saturday, March 02, at the ICFS Education Center in Nugegoda.

The event aims to provide "On the Spot offer letters" to students interested in enrolling at York St. John University's campuses in London and York. All candidates visiting the ICFS Education Center on March 02 will have the opportunity to secure admission to York St. John University within one hour upon meeting Mrs. Bhagya Perera, the Country Manager for York St. John University in Sri Lanka.

Mrs. Perera, with her extensive experience in the international education sector, is well-versed in the requirements of Sri Lankan students, streamlining the process of obtaining a "Spot offer letter." Since her appointment, York St. John University has recruited approximately 300 students annually, establishing itself as one of the most popular British universities in Sri Lanka.

York St. John University's appeal to Sri Lankan students is attributed to its affordable tuition fees, which stand below Rs 4.5 million annually, and its diverse range of subject areas catering to the preferences of Sri Lankan students.

ICFS extends this opportunity to candidates intending to enroll for the September 2024 intake. Miss. Chathurika Dissanayake, CEO of ICFS Education Center, also mentioned that students residing outside Colombo can participate virtually in the event to secure their spot offer letters. Candidates interested in virtual participation are urged to contact ICFS at +94 777 406 793 and +094 777 035 452 to register and submit their documents before Saturday.
