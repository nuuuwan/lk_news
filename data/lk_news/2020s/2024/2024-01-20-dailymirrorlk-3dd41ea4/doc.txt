Leaked audio exposes woman attempting to bribe Narcotics ASP

Colombo, Jan 20 (Daily Mirror) - A leaked audio conversation between a police officer and a female lawyer, suspected of representing a relative of organized criminal Ganemulla Sanjeewa who is being held at the Weeragula Police Station, has surfaced.

It is alleged that during the conversation, the lawyer engaged with an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) from the Narcotics Unit and attempted to offer a bribe.

It was reported that a team of officers from the Police Narcotics Bureau was dispatched to investigate a house in the Makilangamuwa area related to the drug trafficking case involving Ganemulla Sanjeeva.

Sources said that a woman identifying herself as a lawyer representing a relative of Ganemulla Sanjeewa intervened at the location, urging the officers not to search the particular house.

The lawyer, a resident of the Gampaha area, allegedly tried to bribe an ASP of the Narcotics Bureau after her attempts to obstruct the search had failed.

A formal complaint has been filed with the Bribery or Corruption Investigation Commission regarding this incident.
