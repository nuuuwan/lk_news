Warning issued for very heavy showers

The Department of Meteorology has issued an advisory for heavy rain, for Western, Sabaragamuwa, North-western provinces and for Galle, Matara, Kandy, Nuwara-Eliya and Mannar districts.

Due to South-West monsoon conditions which are gradually establishing across the island, prevailing showery and windy conditions will continue further, it said.

Very heavy showers above 150 mm are likely at some places in Western and North-western provinces while heavy showers above 100 mm are likely at some places in Sabaragamuwa province and in Galle, Matara, Kandy, Nuwara-Eliya and Mannar districts, the advisory stated.

The general public, fishing and naval community are kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
