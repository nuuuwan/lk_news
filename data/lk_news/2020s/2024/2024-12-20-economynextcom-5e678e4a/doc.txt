Sri Lanka’s China-backed Hambantota industrial park gets mattress export firm

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Hambantota International Port Group said its industrial park has got a 25 million dollar investment for a mattress producing factory that will export 7,000 containers of products a year.

Comfort Mattress Lanka will construct a 62,000-square-meter factory to make sponge mattress manufacturing on a 30-year renewable lease agreement with HIGP.

It will import raw materials through global supply chain involving South East Asia and China and make the product in Sri Lanka for export.

Firms in the industrial zone will be able to use the container terminal in the Hambantota Port, Chief Executive Wilson Qu said in a statement.

“The container yard we are developing will handle transhipment and strengthen HIP’s positioning as a gateway port,” he said.

“We anticipate heightened interest in the industrial park over the coming years, and as Sri Lanka’s economy stabilises, we foresee industries outside the port taking advantage of HIP’s strategic location.”

The project represents significant opportunities for local employment in Sri Lanka.

Wilson Qu said training youth in the Hambantota district and surrounding areas in technical and mechanical skills was required to ensure that the local workforce is skilled and well-prepared to benefit from the investments. (Colombo/Dec19/2024)
