Attorney General objects to Keheliya’s bail request

Colombo, March 25 (Daily Mirror) - The Attorney General today raised objections against the bail application filed on behalf of former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, who is currently held in remand custody in connection with the alleged import of substandard Immunoglobulin injections.

Deputy Solicitor General Lakmini Girihagama appearing for the Attorney General informed the Court that she was raising preliminary objections challenging the maintainability of the revision application filed by the daughter of the former Health Minister.

Filing a revision application, the former Health Minister's daughter Chaminthri Rambukwella is requesting the Colombo High Court that her father be released on whatever bail conditions the court deems fit.

When the matter came up before High Court Judge Sujeewa Nissanka, the Deputy Solicitor General moved court to dismiss the revision application in limine on the basis that the petitioner has failed to disclose all material facts to the court including Magistrate’s court proceedings dated February 29, 2024.

Meanwhile, President’s Counsel Anuja Premaratne, appearing for the petitioner, denied the allegations made by the Attorney General and informed the Court that they have applied for a certified copy from the Magistrate’s court, and they were yet to receive case proceedings. He further said these facts have been mentioned in the revision application. Taking into consideration the facts, the order regarding the preliminary objections was fixed for April 3 by the Colombo High Court.

In her application, Chaminthri Rambukwella alleged that the Maligakanda Magistrate on a number of occasions refused to grant bail to her father and made remand orders without reasonable grounds. The Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court on March 14 remanded Keheliya and ten others till March 28 in connection with this incident.
