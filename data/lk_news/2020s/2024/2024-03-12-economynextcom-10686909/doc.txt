Pilot project to uplift Aswesuma welfare scheme beneficiaries

ECONOMYNEXT – A pilot project to move 16,000 Aswesuma beneficiary families out of poverty, using Asian Development Bank, World Bank and local funds, will be implemented in selected divisional secretariats in the 25 districts, Cabinet spokesman Minister Bandula Gunawardena said.

“While providing welfare benefits to the people impoverished by the economic crisis, we are implementing a three-year programme that will move them out of poverty gradually,” Gunawardena said.

Cabinet approved the proposal to implement the program which will ’empower family units economically, socially and mentally’.

Applications for the second phase of the welfare scheme close on March 15 (Friday). State Minister for Finance Shehan Semasinghe said payments will be made to the beneficiaries selected under the second phase in July.

Semasinghe said he had discussions with officers of the Samurdhi Development Departments on the importance of empowerment of Aswesuma beneficiaries.

Nearly 2 million people are entitled to welfare benefits under the Aswesuma scheme, and the second phase is expected to increase that number to 2.4 million. 205 billion rupees has been allocated for this purpose in this year’s budget. (Colombo/Mar12/2024)
