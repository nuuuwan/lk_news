Govt says privileges accorded to former Presidents not withdrawn

The Government Information Department has issued a special statement clarifying that the privileges accorded to former Presidents have not been withdrawn.

Issued in response to the media reports alleging that vehicles provided to ex-Presidents have been taken back, the statement said that former Heads of State still retain their privileges and that only the additional vehicles have been returned thus far.

Accordingly, the statement issued by the Director General of Government Information reveals that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has returned 8 out of 16 vehicles which were in his possession and that former President Ranil Wickremesinghe has 11 vehicles.
