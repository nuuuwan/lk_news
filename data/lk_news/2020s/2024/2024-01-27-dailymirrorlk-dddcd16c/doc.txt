Fresh efforts underway to expedite illumination in Expressways

Colombo, Jan. 27 (Daily Mirror)- In the wake of two fatal accidents including the pre-dawn crash that claimed the life of State Minister Sanath Nishantha, the Road Development Authority (RDA) is planning to expedite illumination of the expressway by laying aluminum transmission cables in place of Rs.250 million worth copper current cables stolen during the pandemic.

Darkness is now identified as one of the reasons that can cause accidents on the expressway after nightfall.

Asked for a comment on the situation, Transport, Highways and Media Minister Bandula Gunawardane told Daily Mirror that the RDA, instructed by engineers, decided to lay aluminum cables for power transmission along the expressway that links the airport with the city.

However, he said the project remain delayed and he instructed the officials concerned to complete work in one monthâ€™s time.
