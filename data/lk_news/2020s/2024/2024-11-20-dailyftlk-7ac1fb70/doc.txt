EDB partners IFC; launches Export Excellence Initiative to boost SME competitiveness

In a concerted effort to boost the country’s export potential and fortify the global competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) has partnered with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to launch the Sri Lanka Export Excellence Initiative (SLEEI).

The corporation agreement was signed following discussions between EDB Chairman and Chief Executive Mangala Wijesinghe and IFC representatives. These discussions focused on the initiative’s implementation and its role in supporting the country’s economic recovery through export growth.

The SLEEI is a comprehensive program designed to empower local businesses. It provides targeted training, market access, and support to help SMEs navigate the complexities of international trade.

“This initiative is not just about boosting exports; it’s about equipping Sri Lankan businesses with the tools they need to compete and thrive in a demanding global marketplace,” said Wijesinghe.

SLEEI aims to enable SMEs to embrace sustainable growth while aligning with global trade and sustainability standards. Participating businesses will receive guidance on integrating sustainability principles into their operations, a critical component for competitiveness in international markets.

One of the hallmarks of SLEEI is its focus on sustainability. By incorporating export-focused awareness programs, the initiative ensures that SMEs are prepared to meet international environmental and social standards.

“Sustainability is no longer optional in global trade. It is a prerequisite. Through this program, we aim to create a new generation of SMEs that are not only export-ready but also sustainability-conscious,” Wijesinghe added.

The EDB has emphasised its dedication to fostering a supportive policy environment for SMEs. Wijesinghe reiterated the EDB’s unwavering commitment to the program, highlighting its importance for driving export growth and expanding the contribution of SMEs to the national economy.

The IFC, a long-standing partner in Sri Lanka’s development, echoed this sentiment, noting that the initiative would help SMEs unlock new opportunities and contribute meaningfully to the country’s economic recovery.

“As the global market evolves; Sri Lanka’s focus on innovation, sustainability and capacity building for SMEs through initiatives like SLEEI will be pivotal in strengthening the country’s economic resilience and global trade footprint,” IFC representatives added.
