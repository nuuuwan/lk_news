CPC refinery to become separate govt-owned entity under restructuring plan

Minister of Power and Energy, Kanchana Wijesekera says a discussion on the timeline and process for implementing the reforms pertaining to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) took place yesterday with the senior management of the CPC and the refinery.

In a post on ‘X’ (formerly Twitter), he said that under the restructuring plan, the CPC-owned refinery will be set up as a separate government-owned and operated entity to attract and raise investments with the aim of improving fuel quality, efficiency, capacity, and reducing costs.

The restructuring plan includes revising the current approved carder and salary structure of the CPC while digital platforms will be introduced for multiple functions and services, he said.
