Colombo, Jan 30 (Daily Mirror) - The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) will go ahead with the protest defying the stay order issued by the magistrate's courts a shortwhile ago, its General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara said.

“We will not follow court orders which are undemocratic,” he told the Daily Mirror.

The protest is to begin near the Vihara Mahadevi Park at 1.30 pm today.
