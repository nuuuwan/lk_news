Police warn against circulating misleading videos on social media

Sri Lanka Police says that video footage related to past incidents that had occurred at various times in various parts of the country are once again being circulated on social media these days from time to time.

Issuing a statement, the Police Media Spokespersonâ€™s Office stated that videos such as those showing certain vehicles traveling towards the Katunayake Airport being searched by various individuals and videos taken during curfews imposed in the past are currently being reshared.

Police warned that the recirculation of such videos on social media can spread misinformation.

Police stated that sharing these videos on social media, while falsely presenting them as recent events, is misleading the public and directly obstructs the maintaining of public order and law in the country.

Therefore, the police have requested the public to refrain from posting and spreading such videos on social media.

In the announcement, the police also warned that legal action will be taken against those responsible if any videos that may threaten national security are published online.
