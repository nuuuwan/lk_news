Nishan, a key member of the Leadership Team and Exco at Deloitte Sri Lanka and Maldives, currently serves as the Technology & Transformation Leader and Chief Information Officer.

With 26 years of experience, Nishan has significantly contributed to various national initiatives.

His 17-year tenure at PwC and Deloitte highlights his expertise in driving technological and digital transformation initiatives, including large-scale, citizen-centered technology projects.

At SLASSCOM, he has served in various leadership roles, including Vice Chairman, Head of the Global Trade and Investment Forum, and Head of the Capacity Forum.

His involvement with expert committees convened by the government underscores his dedication to the industry, and he continues to serve on several of these committees.

Sharing his vision, Nishan stated: “My vision is to position Sri Lanka as a global hub for technological innovation and excellence. By harnessing our heritage of collaboration, resilience, and innovation, I am confident that we can achieve this vision. I recognize the legacy of visionary leaders and dedicated boards who have guided us, and I am committed to building on this.”

As the new Chairman, Nishan will continue enhance global trade and investment, foster talent development, promote entrepreneurship and innovation, while championing sustainable best practices, and driving nation-building through policy advocacy.

By calling on the government to implement recommendations on fiscal incentives, public-private partnerships, global trade facilitation, and policy consistency, Nishan aims to enhance the industry’s global competitiveness.

Further, he will maintain dialogues with Government authorities to foster a business-friendly environment and attract inward investments.

He also plans to introduce a ground-breaking ‘Industry Ambassador Program’ to leverage the expertise of distinguished Sri Lankans abroad to represent the industry in key global markets.

Additionally, the ‘Empowering Global Growth’ program will support member companies to enter and thrive in export markets.

A key focus of Nishan’s leadership will be to bridge the skills gap in the IT/BPM sector.

Addressing the loss of mid-tier talent, he emphasized that a key focus will be on up skilling and cross-skilling the existing workforce, with the SLASSCOM Academy playing an important role.

He mentioned that collaborations with universities and academic partners will persist, ensuring the continuous production of future-ready talent for the industry.

In line with the ‘Island of Ingenuity’ ethos, Nishan aims to foster a culture of innovation.

New partnerships with global ecosystems will offer start-ups and entrepreneurs significant opportunities for growth and advancement.

By aligning educational curricula with industry needs, he aims to produce a workforce that is well-equipped to meet the demands of the global market.

This will attract more international companies to set up operations in Sri Lanka, further strengthening the economy.

Nishan will also promote broader adoption of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reporting within the industry.

To foster environmentally friendly software practices, Nishan will educate companies on reducing the carbon footprint of software solutions.

This aligns with global sustainability efforts and sets a leading example for other industries.

By prioritizing sustainability, Sri Lanka’s IT/BPM sector can attract socially responsible investors and customers, thereby boosting its global reputation.

On the social front, Nishan is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion within the industry.

Initiatives to empower women in tech, promote diversity in leadership, and create an inclusive environment will ensure that the industry reflects the diversity of the nation.

These efforts will not only enhance employee well-being but also drive innovation and creativity, as diverse teams are known to perform better.

By creating a positive social impact, the IT/BPM sector can contribute to the overall development of Sri Lankan society.

Nishan, an alumnus of St. Thomas’ College, Mount Lavinia, began his career at KPMG and later served as the COO of SasiaNet (Pvt) Ltd prior to joining PwC and Deloitte.

Nishan Mendis’s leadership at Deloitte and SLASSCOM will not only strengthen the IT/BPM sector but will also drive significant advancements and contribute to the broader economic development of Sri Lanka.

By positioning Sri Lanka as a global hub for technological innovation and excellence, Nishan aims to create a brighter future for the industry and the nation.
