Another night of excitement…

Unbelievable…but I’ve already got reports that the Sri Lankans, in Melbourne, Australia, are eagerly awaiting the arrival of Suzi Fluckiger (Croner) for another evening of great entertainment.

Suzi was in Australia, in November, last year, for the event Country and Western Night, organised by Bertie Ekenaike, who is making it a happening scene for the Sri Lankans in Melbourne. And he does it on a regular basis.

Bertie has decided to give the Sri Lankans what they want, and they want Suzi back.

The singer will be doing the Country and Western night scene on 26th October, this year, at the Grand On Princess.

Suzi says she is very excited about returning to Australia as she made several new friends on her last trip and that they would all be meeting up for a whole lot of fun, and outings.

In Switzerland, reports indicate that she is very active in the scene, in her city, and her performances certainly generate a lot of excitement, I’m told.

She was in the States, last month, taking a short break from music.
