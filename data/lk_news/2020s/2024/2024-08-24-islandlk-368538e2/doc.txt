Serendib Flour Mills’ ‘Uththama Dalada’ project continues nourishing hearts of elders

Serendib Flour Mills, staying true to its commitment of ‘Nourishing the Nation’, is proud to announce the continuation of the ‘Uththama Dalada’ project for the third consecutive year, bringing joy to the elderly.

This year, the initiative will host over 100 elders from four selected homes: two in Kegalle and two in Katugasthota (Kandy). These special guests will embark on an unforgettable journey to visit the Dalada Maligawa, where they will have the opportunity to pay homage and seek blessings.

As with previous events, the elders will once again witness the splendour of the Esala Perahera from a purpose-built enclosure. They will enjoy comfortable front-row seating arrangements, complete with food and refreshments, enhancing their experience of this magnificent cultural spectacle. Serendib Mills will also provide transportation for the elders with a doctor and a medical team on standby to ensure their safety and well-being.

Through the ‘Uththama Dalada’ intiative, Serendib Flour Mills reaffirms its dedication to giving back to the community, especially to the elderly and retired citizens. The initiative serves as a poignant reminder that simple acts of kindness can touch lives and bridge generations.

As the nation will soon celebrate World Elders Day in October, Serendib Flour Mills emphasizes the importance of providing nourishment not only through food but also celebrating good thoughts and deeds, aligning with the company’s purpose of ‘Nourishing the Nation’ in its fullest sense.
