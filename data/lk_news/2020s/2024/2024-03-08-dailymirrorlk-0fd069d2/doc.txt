Maskeliya Pradeshiya Sabha collects three tons of plastic bottles during Sri Pada season

Maskeliya, March 8 (Daily Mirror) - The Maskeliya Pradeshiya Sabha announced today that within three months of the 2023–2024 Sri Pada season commencing, they have successfully gathered three tons of plastic bottles discarded by pilgrims visiting Sri Pada.

Pradeshiya Sabha Secretary S. Rajaweeran said garbage bins have been installed to dispose of plastic water bottles carried by pilgrims travelling along that route.

Some pilgrims just throw plastic water bottles into the environment without putting them into garbage bins.

Pilgrims do not follow the instructions given by the Pradeshiya Sabha to dispose of the raw food items in the bins placed for the disposal of garbage.

The plastic water bottles discarded by Sri Pada pilgrims were taken to the garbage recycling center in Nallathanniya, from where it will be sold to the private sector, the secretary said.

Meanwhile, the current extremely dry weather condition has caused a drinking water problem in the Nallathanniya area. Discussions are underway with the Water Supply Board to solve this issue, according to the secretary.
