Advisory issued for heavy rain, strong winds and rough seas

The Department of Meteorology has issued an ‘Amber’ level advisory for heavy rain, strong winds and rough seas for multi-day boats in the East-Central Bay of Bengal deep sea areas.

In its advisory, the department said a low-pressure area is likely to form over the East-Central Bay of Bengal and adjoining north Andaman Sea in the next 24 hours. Thereafter, it is very likely to move West-Northwestwards and intensify into a depression around 0000 UTC of 22nd October and into a cyclonic storm by 23rd October, 2024 over East-central Bay of Bengal.

Temporarily very strong winds of 70-80 kmph accompanied with heavy rainfalls and very rough seas are likely over above sea areas, it added.

Thus, naval and fishing communities are requested to be vigilant while engaging in fishing and naval activities in the above-sea areas.
