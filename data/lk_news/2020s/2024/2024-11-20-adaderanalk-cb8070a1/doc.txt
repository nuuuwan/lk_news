NPP MPs taken to Parliament complex, guided through practices and procedures

The National People’s Power (NPP) has convened its newly-elected Members of Parliament (MPs) at the party headquarters in Pelawatte today (20) for an orientation session ahead of their parliamentary duties.

During the session, the MPs have been briefed on the party’s upcoming activities and strategic goals. Following this, they were taken to the Parliament complex for a comprehensive introduction to its functioning and procedural mechanisms.

The initiative aims to equip the freshly elected MPs with the necessary knowledge to navigate parliamentary proceedings effectively and to ensure their readiness to represent the government in the legislature.

In the General Election held on November 14, the NPP achieved a remarkable victory, securing 141 seats directly through voting process and an additional 18 seats through the national list, making it a dominant political force in the country.

A majority of the NPP MPs have been elected to the parliament for the first time.

The inaugural session of the 10th Parliament of Sri Lanka is scheduled to be held tomorrow (21).
