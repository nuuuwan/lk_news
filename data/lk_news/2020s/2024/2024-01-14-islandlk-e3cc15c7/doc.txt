Kiriella urges State Minister Siyambalapitiya: ‘Hands off Kandy! No Casinos in our sacred city’

Chief Opposition Whip and Kandy District MP Lakshman Kiriella last week in Parliament voiced his strong opposition to the establishment of casinos in the sacred city of Kandy.

Kiriella called on State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya and the government to refrain from granting permits for casinos not only in Kandy but also in other cities with sacred areas.

“I request the government and the minister not to bring casinos to Kandy. Not only to Kandy but also to other cities with sacred areas such as Anuradhapura and Adam’s Peak should not be selected to set up casinos,” Kiriella said.

This request was made when State Minister Siyambalapitiya revealed that the government has received 10 applications to establish casinos, though none have been approved as of now. The revelation came in response to MP Ven. Athureliye Rathana Thera’s inquiry about the government’s stance on permitting new casinos in Colombo, Kandy, and Jaffna.

Siyambalapitiya detailed the government’s efforts to regulate casinos, emphasizing a license fee of Rs. 500 million for a five-year period. Additionally, he disclosed plans to raise entrance fees, aiming to discourage locals from patronizing these establishments. The state minister argued that introducing casinos is essential for attracting tourists, contributing significantly to an increase in State revenue.

However, Ven. Rathana Thera expressed deep concern, challenging the government’s decision and claiming that licenses for two new casinos, including one in Kandy, have already been granted. He questioned the wisdom of encouraging people to visit casinos in Kandy after worshiping the Sacred Tooth Relic, a significant cultural and religious site in the city. “One wonders whether the Government expects people to visit casinos in Kandy after worshiping the Sacred Tooth Relic,” he said.
