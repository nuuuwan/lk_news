Cabinet nod to instruct Legal Draftsman to prepare CTUR in Sri Lanka Bill with amendments

Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved preparing the Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation (CTUR) in Sri Lanka Bill by incorporating the proposed amendments.

It was approved to instruct the Legal Draftsman to prepare a Bill based on incorporating the said amendments to the preliminary draft and to cancel the gazette notification issued earlier.

In December 2023, Cabinet approved publishing the Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka Bill in the Government Gazette.

However, due to the submission of further amendment proposals for the said Bill by various parties, no steps were taken to present the said Bill to the Parliament.

The Interim Secretariat for Truth and Reconciliation Mechanism has conducted several consultation rounds and identified the amendments to be made to the relevant Bill.

The joint proposal to this effect was presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as the Defence Minister, Justice and Constitutional Reforms Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and the Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabry were approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
