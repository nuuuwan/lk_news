WNPS vows tough action against Adani wind power project

Colombo, Feb 28 (Daily Mirror) - Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) vowed stern legal action against the Adani-sponsored wind power project in Mannar if the proposed environmental concerns on the EIA is not heeded by the Central Environment Authority (CEA), saying over one million birds will be affected annually if the project came into being.

Senior biodiversity scientist Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda said yesterday the proposals on serious environmental concerns about the Mannar wind power generation project will be submitted to the CEA before the given deadline on March 6th.

Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday Dr. Pethiyagoda said if the proposals on the environment impact assessment (EIA) submitted by them were rejected by the CEA, they would seek legal action against the project.

He said even the concerned citizens could comment on the EIA, while it is open for public comments until March 6th addressed to Director General, CEA through dg@cea.lk

Prof Sampath Seneviratne explaining about the situation said Sri Lanka is annually visited by 15 million migratory birds of 250 species from 30 countries as the southernmost destination of the Central Asian Flyway (CAF).

Out of this, over one million migratory birds of 150 species are visiting the Mannar corridor, which functions as a critical over-wintering ground providing breeding habitats for another 26 species of threatened birds.

Prof. Seneviratne said with the oncoming proposed 50 turbine wind power project on the Mannar corridor all those birds will be affected or destroyed. “The proposed 250MW will pose significant risks to both ecological and economic balance,” he said.

Environmental Lawyer Jagath Gunawardena said the EIA on the Mannar project has been conducted based on incomplete Terms of Reference, violating Sri Lankan laws, lack of consultation with key stakeholders and oversight of the Department of Wildlife Conservation’s expertise.
