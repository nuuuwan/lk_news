Sri Lanka to provide interest relief for those who pawned gold

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will implement a programme to provide interest relief to those who pawned gold in licensed commercial banks during the economic crisis, Cabinet spokesman minister Bandula Gunawardena said.

The Cabinet has approved a proposal by the President to implement a programme to grant an interest relief by the Treasury subject to a maximum of an annual 10 percent for pawn advances under 100,000 rupees that were obtained from licensed banks on or before June 30, 2024 on individual basis.

“As a result of the economic crisis, pawning of gold jewellery, which is a common practice, accelerated,” Gunawardena told reporters on Tuesday.

“Pawn advances arrears of 210 billion rupees in 2019 increased to 571 billion rupees by March 2024, a growth of 172 percent.”

Considering the circumstances, “licensed banks have recognized the necessity of granting relief to low income generating community who has obtained pawn advances.” (Colombo/Jul23/2024)
