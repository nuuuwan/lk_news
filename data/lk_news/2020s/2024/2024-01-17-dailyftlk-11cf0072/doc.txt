International commercial mediator training and accreditation program in Sri Lanka

Initiative via collaboration between UDecide Mediation platform and SAGE Mediation Singapore

To expand the opportunities for Sri Lankan professionals to equip themselves with international mediation skills, UDecide mediation platform in collaboration with Sage Mediation, will be launching the first of its kind International Commercial Mediator Training and Accreditation program in Sri Lanka.

The program was specially developed by Sage Mediation, an international mediation firm based in Singapore, and will be led by its CEO Aloysius Goh. Completion of the workshop will set participants on the path to achieving accreditation under the Singapore International Mediation Institute, as well as the Swiss Chamber of Commercial Mediators. This first iteration will be available at a special concessionary rate marking Sage Mediation’s commitment to promoting high-quality mediation practices around the world.  UDecide Mediation Platform and Sage Mediation, is inviting professionals from diverse sectors to make use of this rare opportunity to equip themselves with international mediation skills to provide high-quality amicable dispute resolution services in Sri Lanka and outside.

The United Nations Convention on Mediation (Singapore Convention on Mediation), is an endorsement of the suitability of mediation for commercial dispute resolution worldwide. Sri Lanka signed the Convention on Mediation in 2019 and ratified the same on 10 January 2024. Against this backdrop, Sri Lanka now, more than ever, needs highly trained and qualified mediation professionals.
