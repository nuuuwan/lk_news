Productive economy cannot be built in a single day: Susil

Colombo, Jan 17 (Daily Mirror) - A productive economy cannot be built in a single day, and the entire nation should work with dedication towards that, Education Minister Susil Premajayantha said.

More than enough space is available in all 19 open university premises owned by the Education Ministry, and immediate action should be taken to carry out cultivations that can be used on a daily basis.

In countries with extremely cold climates, during the six months when there is no snow, people engage in growing plants in pots, even in corridors of apartment complexes, and thus contribute to economic growth.

In the background of fulfilling the basic needs of the country under the loan support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the entire population, including the government and other institutions of the country, should be properly prepared to overcome the upcoming disaster situations, such as climate change, he added.
