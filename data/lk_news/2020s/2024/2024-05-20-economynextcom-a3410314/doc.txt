World Bank to conduct energy transition discussion in Sri Lanka

ECONOMYNEXT – The World Bank will conduct a Roundtable on Advancing Energy Transition in Colombo next week, which will focus on attracting investments into the energy sector, Sri Lanka’s Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said.

“The program will focus on attracting investments in the renewable energy sector, accelerating energy transition, green hydrogen programs & scaling up private investments,” Wijesekera said on social media platform X (twitter).

“Energy & Financial experts from development agencies, industry stakeholders & officials from the line ministries will be participating at the event.”

The preliminary discussion on the event was held with the World Bank team at the Ministry of Power and Energy, the minister said.

A forex crisis two years ago saw the island nation face fuel shortages and power cuts in the face of a lack of renewable energy sources.

The state-run power utility, the Ceylon Electricity Board, has said it hopes to increase renewable energy sources to 70 percent of its energy generation mix by 2030, and reduce dependency on fossil fuels.

This will require the addition of considerable generating capacity from renewable energy sources such as solar and wind during the next 6 years. A large component of its present renewable energy sources is hydro – major and mini.
