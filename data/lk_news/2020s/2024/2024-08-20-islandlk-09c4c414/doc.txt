Cap on campaign expenditure

The Election Commission (EC) has set a cap on campaign expenditure at Rs. 109 per voter, and now presidential candidates are legally permitted to spend as much as Rs. 1.8 billion each. Several candidates have already spent colossal amounts of funds on their campaigns, and they will have to account for only the expenditure to be incurred in the last lap of their spending sprees.

Some candidates are bound to spend at least three times the amount permitted by the EC; several of them reportedly sought to have the campaign expenditure limit set at Rs. 200 per voter. This alone is proof of their financial prowess. The EC has directed all candidates to submit detailed statements on their campaign expenditure within three weeks of the conclusion of the presidential election or face the consequences. One, however, should not be so naïve as to expect the candidates to reveal the actual amounts they spend on electioneering. Some of them have mastered the art of amassing ill-gotten wealth and bankrolling their election campaigns with black money, with impunity. So, it will be child’s play for them to circumvent election laws.

It is only wishful thinking that a candidate who secures the presidency by violating election laws can be removed from office. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has, in defiance of a Supreme Court order, prevented the suspension of the IGP and refused to appoint an Acting IGP. So, will it ever be possible to remove an Executive President for violating election laws? Hence the pressing need for the EC to do everything in its power to prevent such transgressions.

Clientelism has been the bane of Sri Lankan politics. It has created a situation where politicians win elections by showering goodies on poor voters and looking after the interests of their supporters at the expense of the public. The state sector is bursting at the seams owing to numerous politically-motivated recruitment drives under successive governments. Minister Bandula Gunawardena revealed in Parliament, last month, that between 50% to 86% of the country’s tax revenue was spent on the public sector salaries and pensions. There is a state employee for every 14 citizens in this country!

The presidential candidates and their parties must also be made to reveal sources of campaign funds. A surge in donations has turned the campaign war chests of political parties into a veritable Golconda. Figuratively, some candidates have been bottom-trawling for funds across the globe during the past several months and their catches are said to be huge. It is also alleged that some candidates have benefited from the largesse of foreign governments as well. A great deal of black money pours into the country during elections. Perhaps, notorious drug dealer Makandure Madush, who was Sri Lanka’s Napoleon of Crime, would have exposed the politicians he had helped financially or otherwise, if he had not been killed while in police custody. Moneybags, both local and foreign, eyeing state assets and planning to cut shady deals similar to the on-arrival visa scam and corrupt power sector contracts also loosen their purse strings during elections here.

Successive governments have misused state resources, both human and physical, for electioneering purposes. Complaints abound that President Wickremesinghe, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, their ministers and presidential advisors are misusing public assets for electioneering purposes.

Ruling party politicians misuse state-owned ground vehicles and aircraft, among other things, for electioneering, and special security arrangements to ensure their protection, involving thousands of police and military personnel, cost the public an arm and a leg. Taxpayers have to bear part of the ruling party politicians’ campaign expenditure. How can a level playing field be ensured for all candidates in an electoral contest if the ruling party politicians among them are allowed to misuse public assets?
