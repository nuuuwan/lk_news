Minister urges union to end strike and return to duty

Colombo, June 10 (Daily Mirror) - Transport and Highways Minister Bandula Gunawardena today requested the Sri Lanka Railways Locomotive Operating Engineers’ Union to call off their strike and report to work.

He made this request during the discussion held with the union at the Transport Ministry.

“I brought a long-neglected issue to the Cabinet and successfully secured approval for promotions in March 2024.

"The promotion process for train drivers is now underway. Applications were received from 75 train drivers seeking promotion from third class to second class, and 70 of them have already been issued their promotion letters," the Minister said.

Therefore, Minister Gunawardena requested that the union end the strike and avoid inconveniencing the public, ensuring that promotions will be granted in the future according to the prescribed procedure.
