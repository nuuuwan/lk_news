‘The time to reform is now’ – Ali Sabry on Sri Lankan cricket

Sri Lanka’s Foreign Minister and Chairman of Cabinet Sub-Committee appointed to examine the issues faced by Sri Lanka Cricket says that the country’s recent disappointments in the ICC World Cup 2023 and ICC T20 World Cup are not isolated incidents.

“They are stark indicators of the deep-rooted problems within our cricketing infrastructure. These issues cannot be resolved with temporary fixes.”

“What we need is a bold, professional approach that frees our cricket from the control of those who have turned it into a personal enterprise,” Minister Ali Sabry said, in a post on ‘X’ (formerly Twitter) on Saturday.

He pointed out that cricket is the heartbeat of Sri Lanka, a sport that has brought smiles, pride, and unity to our nation. “Our triumphs, especially the World Cup victory, have etched unforgettable memories in the hearts of all Sri Lankans. Yet, today, our cherished sport is in crisis, suffering from a decline that calls for an urgent and comprehensive overhaul.”

Sabry stated that as the chairman of the cabinet sub-committee appointed to examine the state of cricket in the country, he can attest to the pressing need for reform.

The report addressing issues in Sri Lanka’s cricket realm, prepared by the Cabinet Sub-Committee, was presented to President Ranil Wickremesinghe on January 01, 2024.

The Minister said the report lays out a clear path forward, and that they are now on the brink of implementing these crucial changes through new legislation. He stressed that this is a decisive moment for Sri Lankan cricket.

“We must seize this opportunity and get the reforms enacted with a new sports law and constitution for Sri Lanka cricket,” Sabry said.

He added that cricket in Sri Lanka is not just a game or a business; and that it is a “reflection of our national spirit.”

“Our success should not be measured by financial metrics but by the victories we achieve on the field and the hope we inspire in our people. Currently, our performance is far from acceptable, and the time for change is now.”

He urged for everyone to unite and act decisively for the future of Sri Lankan cricket, making it stronger, fairer, and more successful than ever before. “The time to reform is now.”
