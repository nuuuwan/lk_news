CEB criticized for ‘delaying’ electricity tariff revision

The Petroleum Trade Unions have criticized the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) for failing to implement the revision of electricity tariffs, which was supposed to take place on October 01, allegedly due to the irresponsible actions of the CEB.

During a press conference held in Colombo yesterday (16), the convener of the union, Ananda Palitha, expressed concerns over the issue.

“The Electricity Board has not yet provided the necessary data to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) for the revision of the electricity tariffs. Currently, the CEB’s net profit exceeds Rs. 155 billion. Why is there room for further exploitation?” he questioned.

Further, he urged the President to intervene, stating, “If you are committed to the welfare of the people, you should question the CEB on what it has been doing all this time. Immediate action can be taken to revise the electricity bill, potentially reducing it by at least 45 percent.”
