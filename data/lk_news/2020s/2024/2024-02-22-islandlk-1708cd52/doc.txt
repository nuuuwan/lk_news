Relevance of Buddhism in contemporary world

Buddhism is a teaching expounded by the Buddha, who lived in northern India between the mid-6th century and mid-4th century BCE. However, there is a disagreement among some scholars as to the exact dates of his birth and death. It is believed that Buddhism has an estimated 500 million followers worldwide today. Many civilisations and countless lives have been shaped by the Buddha’s thinking enunciated in his discourses. What the Buddha expounded for nearly half a century is known as dhamma which is just as pertinent in the contemporary world as it was several centuries ago. In brief, dhamma means reality.

Buddhism has played a central role in spiritual, and cultural social life from its very inception. It has brought immense psychological, and spiritual solace and relief to people who are overwhelmed by immense suffering and challenges in their lives. Moreover, the advent of Buddhism has paved the way for social equality and democratic values.

Buddhism does not fit within the narrow definition of typical religion, as many philosophical and scientific elements are encapsulated in its teachings distinct from its strictly religious, ritual, and devotional aspects. Although Buddhism has undergone various adaptations and transformations since the time of the Buddha, the essence of his core teachings remains as relevant as it was 2600 years ago and Buddha’s wisdom has endured through the ages.

The Buddha’s primary concern was to enlighten people on the most important question of suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation, through his fundamental teachings like the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. His teaching provided enduring guidance for navigating life’s complexities and challenges in an ever-evolving world.

The Buddha was an unequaled teacher endowed with towering wisdom and great intellect. He was a foremost analyst of mind and worldly phenomena. Buddha’s teachings have provided a great deal of insights to mankind so that they may live a more mindful compassionate life. Buddha made a deep analysis of how the human mind works and he had a keen insight into the human condition. Buddhism asserts that the human mind is the realm within which lies the source of our suffering and salvation. Buddhism locates the source of suffering and the problems human beings face in their never-ending craving and ignorance.

He gave his adherents the unfettered freedom to examine and investigate what he expounded for nearly half a century during his lifetime. He emphasized the importance of empirical observation and rational inquiry into his teachings as is borne out by often quoted Kalamasutta. Buddha did not claim to have created worldly conditions or universal phenomena.

He merely rediscovered the existing incontrovertible truth and made it known to mankind so that they could free themselves of suffering and find salvation. On one occasion, Buddha declared “Whether Thathagatha appears in the world or not order exists; the fixed nature of the phenomenon, their regular pattern, and their general conditionality. This the Thagatha discovers and comprehends and having done so he points it out and teaches it, explains and establishes it, reveals, analyses and clarifies it, and says: Look“.

The Buddha’s teachings are timeless (akaliko) and continue to be relevant today as they guide living a happy fulfilling life. Buddhism has a great deal to offer everyone, and its relevance was not confined to the time it was propounded but continues to this day.

Here are some of Buddha’s teachings that are particularly relevant today and will continue to be relevant for many more years to come.

Buddhism emphasises morality in life like many other major religions of the world. It upholds lofty and demanding moral and ethical values in many of its scriptures and codes of precepts. The Five precepts in Buddhism which are known as Panchal Silla in Pali and Sanskrit constitute the minimal standard of morality that Buddhists are expected to observe in their daily lives and can be validly observed by anyone regardless of their religious persuasion. They constitute basic ethical principles that Buddha laid down for lay followers may help people in the contemporary world desist from harming themselves and others, regard life as inviolable and respect property, maintain purity and honesty, and preserve clarity in thinking.

The emphasis on nonviolence and compassion towards all beings is reflected in various discourses of the Buddha and would be of tremendous help for the promotion of peace and harmony among diverse communities. In a world where divisions and conflicts exist, people draw inspiration from the Buddha’s teachings as they provide essential insights and practices that may help people lead a more mindful and compassionate existence. Moreover,

Buddhism plays a role in helping people cope with their mental and psychological afflictions and problems. Buddhist teachings have brought mental peace, and satisfaction to people in times of crisis, uncertainty, and insecurity and also when they are in desperate situations.

Meditative practices in Buddhism can be useful to a person as a way of training the mind and helping to develop more beneficial attitudes toward life. The teaching of mindfulness emphasises, the importance of being present in the moment and developing awareness of one’s thoughts emotions, and actions.

Similarly, the Four Sublime States that is loving-kindness (metta), compassion (karuna), sympathetic joy (mudita), and equanimity (uppekka). enunciated in buddhism are some of the positive mental qualities even non-Buddhist can cultivate and radiate to all living beings in the present problematic world.

Buddhism teaches us that life is a journey beset with many problems and challenges. It has been likened to a pendulum that turns to the right and left. Four undesirable conditions prevail in this world which everyone, without exception, faces in the course of one’s life. (Narada). Life has phases of happiness and unhappiness.

When one is blessed with gain fame, praise, or happiness he is delighted and satisfied. On the other hand, when the same person faces unfavorable situations such as loss, insult ill fame, blame, and pain he will dejected and unhappy. The inability to face unfavorable situations in life drives some to resort to such extreme measures as suicide murder violence theft etc.

We live in a world in which ordinary people are constantly prone to temptation to moral transgression, as unwholesome states of mind, delusion (moha), greed (raga), and hatred (devesa) are firmly embedded in their minds.

Any mental or physical actions springing from these roots known as akusala in Buddhism would be detrimental to a person’s wellbeing. Realization of this truth will enable us to lead a more meaningful and morally acceptable life.

Moreover, today people who live in a hedonistic materialistic world saturated with distractions and otherworldly things caused by insatiable greed can find solace and inspiration from the core teachings of the Buddha
