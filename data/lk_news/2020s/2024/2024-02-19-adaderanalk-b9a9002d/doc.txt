CEB urges consumers to use electricity sparingly

The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has urged consumers to use electricity sparingly, in light of the recent increase in demand and prevailing dry weather conditions.

Speaking at a special press briefing held on Monday (19 Feb.), CEB spokesman, Deputy General Manager Eng. Noel Priyantha revealed that 46 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity has been consumed for the month of February thus far.

He noted, however, that due to the current arid weather conditions, hydropower generation has been restricted to only 20% capacity.
