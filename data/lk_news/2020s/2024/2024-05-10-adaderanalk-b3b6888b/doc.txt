Supreme Court moves another petition filed by Diana Gamage

The Supreme Court has ordered that the petition filed by former State Minister Diana Gamage challenging a decision taken by the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) to cancel her party membership, be called on May 28.

This petition was taken up before the three-member Supreme Court bench consisting of Justices Gamini Amarasekara, Kumuduni Wickremesinghe and Mahinda Samayawardhena today (10).

At the time, President’s Counsel Faiszer Musthapha who appeared for the petitioner Diana Gamage, requested for a date to inform the court of the decision to be taken regarding this petition.

Accordingly, the judge bench ordered that the relevant petition be called on May 28 and that the decision regarding the maintaining of this petition be announced on the relevant date.

Leader of the  Opposition Sajith Premadasa, General Secretary of the SJB Ranjith Madduma Bandara and several others have been named as respondents in this petition.

The SJB had earlier decided to expel Diana Gamage from the party citing that she had failed to comply with the unanimous decision taken by the party to vote against the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, by voting in favour. The SJB had also highlighted that this was a serious violation of party discipline, and that the Opposition Leader and the SJB’s leader Sajith Premadasa decided to suspend her party membership for the reputation or well-being and prosperity of the party.
