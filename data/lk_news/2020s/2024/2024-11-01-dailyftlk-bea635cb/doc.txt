Cinnamon Life Director of Marketing Radiesha Daluwatte emphasises the partnership’s ambition: “This isn’t just another venue hosting SLDF. It’s a stage where local talent connects with global leaders, sparking collaborations that foster growth and innovation. SLDF allows us to celebrate Sri Lanka’s creative potential and show the world that Colombo isn’t just evolving—it’s thriving.”

Cinnamon Life Director of Commercial Declan Hurley said: “When we talk about Cinnamon Life, we’re talking about more than a hotel or an event space; it’s a lifestyle destination that thrives on collaboration, creativity, and entertainment. Partnering with SLDF is an exciting opportunity because it positions us exactly where we want to be, at the intersection of global design and local innovation. It’s not just about hosting events; it’s about offering a platform where creativity is celebrated and nurtured, attracting both established artists and emerging talent. Cinnamon Life Presents aims to do just that: create a gateway where talent, entertainment, and business align.”

This collaboration is more than a one-time festival; it is part of a larger commitment to building Colombo’s reputation as an essential destination for cultural dialogue, economic expansion, and creative transformation.

The partnership’s mutual vision is to present Sri Lanka’s creative capital in the spotlight, gathering entrepreneurs, designers, and cultural thinkers under one roof. The result is an immersive environment where creativity, culture, and business converge—an invitation to the world to witness Colombo’s evolution through curated spaces and experiences designed to push boundaries and elevate design-led thinking. For Cinnamon Life, hosting the SLDF is not merely a showcase but a stepping stone towards a sustained vision. Hurley asserts, “This collaboration will showcase Colombo as a city where culture and commerce converge seamlessly, putting us on the radar as a destination that offers something truly unique.”

Through this partnership, Cinnamon Life and SLDF are showcasing luxury as a fusion of creativity, innovation, and cultural exchange.

At Cinnamon Life, we blend creativity, authenticity, and innovation to make luxury memorable. Partnering with SLDF and MBFWSL enables us to present a new narrative for luxury in Colombo—one that celebrates artistic expression, craftsmanship, and world-class design.”

This vision of luxury resonates with a global audience seeking more than opulence; it attracts those drawn to a destination where local culture, design, and art are essential to every experience. By reimagining luxury as a convergence of culture and innovation, Cinnamon Life fosters a distinctive Colombo narrative that appeals to international travellers and local audiences alike.

With SLDF, Cinnamon Life amplifies Colombo’s global presence as a hub for arts, culture, and commerce.
