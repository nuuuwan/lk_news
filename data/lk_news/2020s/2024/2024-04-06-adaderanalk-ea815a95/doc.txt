Entry to SLFP headquarters suspended amid investigation into ‘missing files’

Entering the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) headquarters in Darley Road, Colombo 10, has been suspended for all individuals, due to the ongoing investigation into the complaint lodged at Maradana Police alleging that several ‘important’ files have gone missing from the establishment.

Police stated that accordingly, it is prohibited for all parties to enter the SLFP headquarters until the preliminary investigations are completed.

The Acting General Secretary of SLFP Dushmantha Mithrapala has lodged a complaint with the Maradana Police on Friday (05), alleging that several ‘important’ files have gone missing from the party headquarters.

However, the Acting General Secretary alleged that the police also prevented them from entering the auditorium of the party headquarters, which is not related to the incident.
