Sri Lanka adds 182,000 to get tax payer income support, Rs58bn paid

ECONOMYNEXT â€“ Sri Lanka has added 182,000 person to get tax payer support through Aswesuma income supplements, taking the total to 1.854 million beneficiaries, State Minister for Finance Shehan Semasinghe has said.

All due payments would be made by April 18, Minister Semasinghe has said. A total of 58 billion rupees of taxes collected from the people would be spent on 1.854 million beneficiaries.

For the full year 205 billion rupees has been allocated for income re-distribution.

In a second round of calls, 400,000 people have applied to get benefits. Of this 286,000 has been added to the platform and evaluation is due to begin in May, he said.

Under the Aswesuma scheme, payments are not expected to be permanent, except for people like kidney patients, but a helping hand to get over loss of incomes for a period.

Former Samurdhi beneficiaries who are earning high incomes and are owning vehicles and businesses were supposed to have been phased out of tax payer support, and the funds directed to more deserving persons, but the move was resisted by political activists, analysts say.
