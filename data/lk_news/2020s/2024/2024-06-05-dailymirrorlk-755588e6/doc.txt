Gunman attacks U.S. Embassy in  Lebanon

June 05 - A gunman was captured after opening fire at the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon's capital, Beirut, on Wednesday â€” an attack that took place as U.S. ally Israel signaled it could soon launch an offensive in the country against Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned early Wednesday that Israel was "prepared for very intense action in the north," as he visited a border city hit by wildfires sparked by Hezbollah rockets.

The escalation has piled pressure on Netanyahu from right-wing members of his government, who have also threatened to quit if he agrees to the U.S.-backed cease-fire proposal. President Joe Biden criticized Netanyahu in an interview published Tuesday, but also dispatched top aides to the region for new talks with mediators as Washington pushes for a deal that would end eight months of fighting in Gaza and secure the release of hostages held by Hamas.
