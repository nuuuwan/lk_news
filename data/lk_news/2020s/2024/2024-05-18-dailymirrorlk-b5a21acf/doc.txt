Shortage of elephant participation for Kandy Esala Perahera

Colombo, May 18 (Daily Mirror) - A situation has arisen where getting the participation of elephants at both peraheras has become a problem due to the holding of the Ratnapura Maha Saman Devalaya Perahera and the Kandy Esala Perahera on the same day, Sri Dalada Maligawa Diyawadana Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela said.

He told the Daily Mirror that at least 60 elephants will be able to participate in the Kandy Esala Perahera this year. During previous Kandy Esala Perahera seasons, 75 elephants participated, he said.

"There are a total of 96 tamed elephants available in the country, but only 80 elephants can be taken for peraheras this season due to their physical health conditions and other issues. At least 20 elephants will be sent for the Ratnapura Maha Saman Devalaya perahera, and the remaining elephants will be assigned to the Kandy Esala perahera," the Diyawadana Nilame said.

He said in 2000, a total of 225 tamed elephants were in the country, but now the count had decreased to 96.
