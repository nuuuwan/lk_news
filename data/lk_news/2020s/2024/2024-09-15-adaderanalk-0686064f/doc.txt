EC warns presidential candidates against promoting rivals

The Election Commission has emphasized that it is unlawful for any presidential candidate to promote another candidate during the campaign.

In an official statement, the commission clarified that candidates who have filed nominations for the upcoming presidential election are expected to campaign solely for their own victory.

The statement also noted that complaints have been received alleging that some candidates are endorsing or promoting their rivals, in violation of election laws.

The commission warned that any candidate found engaging in such prohibited activities, as well as those being promoted, will face legal consequences in accordance with election regulations.
