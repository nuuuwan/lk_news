Aquaman star Jason Momoa hails Sri Lanka’s mangrove restoration efforts

Hollywood actor Jason Momoa has congratulated Sri Lanka for being declared a UN World Restoration Flagship, in recognition of the island nation’s efforts to rebuild and restore its mangrove ecosystems.

In a video statement, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Advocate for Life Below Water, commended the endeavours of the island nation.

The Aquaman star further said: “As a native Hawaiian, I saw the impacts of climate change first had this year, the devastating lines of fires. We urgently need to revive the health of our lands, the coasts and oceans.

“After the tsunami, the island of Sri Lanka also had to build back. And they did it using the power of nature as a solution versus fighting against it. I want to celebrate Sri Lanka for its recognition as the UN World Restoration Flagship.

“In the country, citizens and partners are working together to naturally generate 10,000 hectares of mangrove forest by 2030. To fortify the coastline. Congratulations Sri Lanka. Mahalo for working together to create positive change. You are the example.”

Earlier this month, marking a landmark achievement, Sri Lanka was named a UN World Restoration Flagship for its vital efforts to restore the mangrove ecosystems.

Through the World Restoration Flagship Award, the UN honours the planet’s most ambitious, successful, and inspiring examples of large-scale ecosystem restoration.

The prestigious recognition signifies Sri Lanka’s effective use of the UN’s Principles for Ecosystem Restoration and highlights globally significant best practices and methodologies that can potentially serve as a framework for future success across the world.
