SLPP suspends party membership of three MPs

The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has suspended the party membership of three Members of Parliament.

Accordingly, the party membership of Anuradhapura District MP S.M. Chandrasena, Ratnapura District MP Pavithra Wanniarachchi and Kalutara District MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena have been suspended.

Their party membership has been suspended for going against the SLPP Politburo’s decision to support the party’s presidential candidate, which was taken at its meeting held on July 29.

The statement further says that the three MPs’ membership in SLPP’s All-Island Working Committee, the Executive Committee and Politburo have also been suspended.
