Death toll after fishermen drink from bottle found in sea climbs to 05

The Director General of the Department of Fisheries & Aquatic Resources, Susantha Kahawatta, stated that one of the two Sri Lankan fishermen taken onboard the Singaporean merchant vessel for emergency treatment has been reported dead, raising the total deaths to five among the 6-member crew.

It was reported this morning (30) that the death toll following the incident where the crew of a fishing vessel had consumed the contents of a bottle they found floating in the sea, assuming it was liquor, had increased to four while two others are in critical condition.

The two fishermen who were critically ill had been taken aboard a Singaporean merchant vessel and were provided with emergency treatment.

The Singaporean vessel is expected to transfer the two fishermen to SLNS Vijayabahu at sea.

However, one of the two fishermen has also passed away leaving just one survivor from the six-man crew of the fishing trawler.

The Director General of the Department of Fisheries & Aquatic Resources, Susantha Kahawatta, stated yesterday that the crew of the fishing boat named “Devon 5,” which had set out to sea from the Tangalle fisheries harbor, have faced this predicament after they had found several bottles containing an unknown liquid floating in the sea and consumed some of it assuming that it was alcohol.

He said medical teams had provided instructions for emergency first aid via communications devices and that there was insufficient time to send another vessel out to sea to retrieve them as they are in the deep-sea area.

He said that attempts were being made to board them into a nearby vessel and bring them ashore.

Kahawatta stated that according to the information received thus far, the fishermen in question had found several bottles floating in the sea and that they have distributed a portion of the bottles to nearby fishing trawlers. He said steps are being taken to notify these other boats.

Initially, it was reported yesterday that two out of the six crew members of a fishing vessel that set out from Tangalle have died, and the remaining four are in critical condition after consuming the contents of a bottle they found floating in the sea, assuming it was liquor.

The incident has reportedly occurred while the boat was around 320 nautical miles (592.64 km) off the coast of Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka Navy said the vessel was being towed back to land with the help of another craft.
