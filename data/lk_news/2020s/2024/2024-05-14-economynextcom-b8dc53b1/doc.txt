Sri Lanka’s EDB and Peoples’ Bank tie up to offer exporters finance, knowledge

ECONOMYNEXT – People’s Bank will offer financial advisory services, funding facilities, and trade finance options to exporters in partnership with the Sri Lanka Export Development Board.

EDB will identify global market opportunities and facilitate the necessary prerequisites to promote exports from Sri Lanka.
