Colombo, Feb 14 (Daily Mirror) - Moving away from the Colombo and Southern Province, the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) has made arrangements to initiate a series of projects under the theme "Wings of Friendship," coinciding with the 73rd anniversary of the Sri Lanka Air Force in the North from March 2.

As part of this initiative, community development programmes will be executed, focusing on the northern province, with a financial value exceeding Rs 125 million.

Air Force Commander Air Marshal Udeni Rajapaksa said that in the northern province of Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Vavuniya, and Mullaitivu areas, 73 schools have been identified for development/renovation. The commencement of these projects has already begun, with an estimated total cost of about Rs 100 million.

Moreover, a donation of 73,000 school books will be made to selected schools under the program "Magen Pothak Uthurata," with an estimated cost of Rs 25 million.

The Commander emphasized that state funds will not be utilized for these projects, and all funding will come from donors.

The Commander said that the Sri Lanka Air Force plans to conduct the “Guwan Hamuda Papedi Sawariya 2024” for the 25th occasion, coinciding with the 73rd Anniversary of the SLAF. This event will take place from March 3 to 7, covering a 650km distance for the men's event, starting from Galle Face and concluding at Jaffna Muttraweli Grounds, while the female race will cover 100km.

The SLAF will also host the Air Tattoo, Education, and Technology exhibition from March 6 to 10 at Muttraweli Grounds in Jaffna. During the Tattoo, several events and shows including humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations will be conducted, utilizing Indian Air Force and SLAF helicopters.

The Commander said that the general public including students, will have access to explore the technology showcased during the event, stating, "I think that this will be a huge opportunity for all the students and also, the general public to come and see and explore their world."

He also highlighted the substantial support received from the people in Jaffna, emphasizing the unity between SLAF and the local community, as well as support from international organizations and the diaspora.

Meanwhile, the income generated from the air tattoo will be directed towards funding the "Wings of Friendship" projects.
