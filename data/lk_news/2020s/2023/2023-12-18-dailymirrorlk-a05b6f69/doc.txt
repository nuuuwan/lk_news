Former Health Secretary arrested

Colombo, Dec 18 (Daily Mirror) - Former Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Sri Chandragupta was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) a short while ago.

According to sources, he was arrested after the CID recorded a statement over the import of substandard Immunoglobulin injections.

With regard to the ongoing investigations related to the substandard Immunoglobulin scandal, several officials including the Director of the Medical Supplies Division are currently in remand custody.

Trade unions representing health professionals have raised concerns that the recent arrests made by the CID in connection with the import of substandard Immunoglobulin injections are only targeting lower-level individuals, while the masterminds behind the scandal remain at large.
