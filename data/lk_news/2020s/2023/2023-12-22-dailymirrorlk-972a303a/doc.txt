Government issues conditions for state employees to claim bonuses

The Government has announced that payment of bonuses to the staff of state institutions should be made for the year 2023 only if the particular institution has earned profits during the financial year 2022 and has paid at least 30% of the profit after tax as dividends to the Consolidated Fund.

State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe took to Twitter stating that bonuses for the staff of Commercial Corporations, Statutory Boards and Government Owned Companies for the year 2023 should be granted if the institutions have earned profits during the financial year 2022 and have paid at least 30% of the profit after tax as dividend to the Consolidated Fund.

He said if these institutions have earned profits during the financial year 2022 but have not paid at least 30% of the profit after tax as dividend to the Consolidated Fund, or have recorded a loss during the financial year 2022, then they are not entitled to a bonus based on the profitability of the institution.
