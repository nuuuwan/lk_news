SJB blames Rajapaksas for impending financial burden on public, calls for Government change

The main opposition has voiced concerns about the imminent transfer of the burdens arising from corruption, fraud, financial misappropriations, and flawed politics of the Rajapaksas onto the general public, effective January 1 next year.

During a press conference at the Opposition Leader’s Office in Colombo on Thursday, SJB MP Mayantha Dissanayake asserted that the recently passed Budget in Parliament would mark the final budget of the current government. Dissanayake emphasized that people could not endure another year under what they described as an oppressive regime.

“The implementation of an 18 percent VAT starting January 1 will lead to price hikes across all commodities, imposing unbearable taxation and triggering unprecedented consequences. This tax will significantly burden those who are still struggling to cover their basic expenses,” said Dissanayake.

Dissanayake accused the President of neglecting the national economy and the crisis-stricken populace, alleging that instead of aiding them, the President is aiding the Rajapaksas to safety. The SJB MP pointed to a Supreme Court verdict that highlighted those responsible for the country’s economic downturn, accusing the President of shielding them due to a desire to cling to power.

“The President’s government is dancing to the tune of the International Monetary Fund, and this crisis cannot be rectified without an election,” Dissanayake affirmed. “It’s time for the people to realize that a democratic election is the only path to change their circumstances. The nation requires a government devoid of corrupt politicians to ensure transparency.”

SJB General Secretary, Ranjith Madduma Bandara of the Moneragala District, also spoke at the press conference.
