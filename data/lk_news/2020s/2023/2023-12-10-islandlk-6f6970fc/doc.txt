President urges minimum Rs 1,700 per day

President Ranil Wickremesinghe has called upon the leaders of plantation companies to unite in efforts to establish a collective agreement regarding the long-debated issue of increasing wages for plantation workers. The President proposed a minimum wage hike to Rs 1,700, aligning with the workers’ demand, or alternatively, to reach a consensus on an appropriate increased wage figure by Dec 31, the President’s Media Division said on Friday.

This recommendation is in addition to President Wickremesinghe’s proposal announced during the budget 2024 to allocate Rs. 4 billion to address the needs of citizens in the estate sector.
