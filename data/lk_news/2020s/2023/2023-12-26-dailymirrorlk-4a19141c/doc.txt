Risk of new COVID variant spreading in Sri Lanka minimal: Health Ministry

Colombo, Dec.26 (Daily Mirror) - The Ministry of Health asserted that the risk of the JN-1 sub-variant spreading in Sri Lanka is currently deemed very low.

However, the Ministry said to assess this risk, the Medical Research Institute has been directed to conduct genetic tests in collaboration with the Southeast Asia Regional Office of the WHO.

As part of proactive measures, the Ministry has intensified COVID-19 testing efforts, especially in major hospitals.

Recent tests have yielded promising results, with a notably low number of COVID-19 cases reported, and recent samples testing negative, according to the Ministry's statement.

Despite these encouraging findings, the Ministry underscores the importance of adhering to preventive measures.

Meanwhile, expert advice emphasizes practices like wearing masks, frequent handwashing, maintaining distance, and observing proper cough and sneeze etiquettes to curb the spread of influenza and respiratory diseases.
