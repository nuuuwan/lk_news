SriLankan Airlines issues apology for travel disruptions

Colombo, Dec.24 (Daily Mirror) - SriLankan Airlines today extended apologies to customers affected by recent travel disruptions involving a series of cancellations and delays.

The airline faced challenges as two Airbus A330 aircraft were grounded for several days during this busy period. One aircraft required an extended check, with a part replacement delayed due to a global supply shortage. The other experienced a burst tire incident in Paris.

Simultaneously, delays in receiving two spare engines and a newly leased A320 aircraft further strained the operational fleet, leading to unavoidable flight cancellations and delays.

SriLankan Airlines acknowledges the inconvenience caused to passengers during the festive season and expresses regret for any disruption to travel plans.

The airline said they are working tirelessly to expedite travel arrangements for affected passengers.

Looking ahead, significant improvements are expected in the coming days. The recently leased A320 aircraft has already been incorporated into the fleet, and two A320s are set to return to service with replaced engines in the next week.

Additionally, a backup A330 from Air Belgium is scheduled to arrive this weekend, with the airline anticipating the return of both grounded aircraft.
