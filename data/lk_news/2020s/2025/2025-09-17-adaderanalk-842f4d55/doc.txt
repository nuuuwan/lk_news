Establishing child-friendly testimony rooms turning point in Sri Lanka’s judicial system: Justice Minister

The establishment of secure testimony rooms for children marks a significant turning point in the country’s judicial system, Minister of Justice and National Integration Harsha Nanayakkara stated.

The Minister expressed these views this afternoon (17), via video technology, during the launch event in Kandy for a program aimed at systematizing services for child victims of violence.

Coinciding with this, a digital testimony room equipped with facilities to allow juveniles to give evidence safely was opened at the Kandy Court Complex.

“The establishment of secure testimony rooms for children should be recognized as a milestone in the Sri Lankan judicial system. Children who come before the law as victims must have the ability to give testimony in a safe environment. The opening of a digitally equipped testimony room within the Kandy High Court – enabling child victims to testify safely – is the first of its kind in the country. We are working to introduce such facilities to courts island-wide. We must extend our gratitude to the European Union, UNICEF, and other organizations that supported this effort. Ensuring a safe country for children is a key objective of the current government. Strong new legislation for child protection will also be introduced in the near future.”

These new facilities allow child victims to give testimony from a separate room within the court premises.

Introducing such services for child victims of violence is part of Sri Lanka’s commitments made at the 2024 Bogotá Summit to end violence against children.
