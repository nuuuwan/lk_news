Sri Lanka’s public debt office to evaluate liability management by January 2026

ECONOMYNEXT – A Public Debt Management Office (PDMO) set up by Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Finance in December last year, to oversee the management of the country’s public debt, will become fully operational by next year, the ministry secretary has said.

“Under its mandate, the PDMO will be tasked with carrying out a proactive debt management strategy,” Harshana Suriyapperuma said in the central bank Investor Call – July question and answer session.
