Sri Lanka’s most anticipated life insurance customer promotion is back – bigger, brighter, and brimming with adventure, with Ceylinco Life unveiling the 19th edition of its iconic ‘Family Savari’ mega promotion, promising unforgettable journeys abroad and at home for hundreds of lucky policyholder families.

In its 19th year, the excitement continues with the announcement of the destinations for 2026.

The highlight of Family Savari 19 will be a fully-paid holiday to Beijing, China, for five winning families, totalling 20 people, who will explore the city’s rich culture and world-famous landmarks. Another 10 families – 40 people in all – will head to Malaysia for an exotic getaway, while a massive 250 families, or 1,000 people, will be treated to a day of thrills, slides and laughter at the Pearl Bay Water Park in Bandaragama.

The promotion runs from up to 31st December 2025, with winners to be selected at a grand draw in January 2026.
