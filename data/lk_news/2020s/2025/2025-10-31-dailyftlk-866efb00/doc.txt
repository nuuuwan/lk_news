Legal aid reform necessary to safeguard democracy and human dignity

India’s Justice Surya Kant delivers inaugural BASL Human Rights Oration

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) recently held its inaugural Human Rights Oration at the Dr. H.W. Jayewardene, QC Auditorium in Colombo, featuring Supreme Court of India Senior Most Judge and National Legal Services Authority Executive Chairman Justice Surya Kant, who also serves as Chief Patron of the Commonwealth Legal Education Association (CLEA), as the keynote speaker.

Speaking on the theme “Strengthening a Legal Aid System to Achieve the Human Rights of the Marginalised and Minorities – The Indian Case Study,” Justice Kant outlined India’s pioneering model of legal aid and its constitutional and ethical foundations.

He detailed NALSA’s three-tiered structure comprising 37 State Legal Services Authorities, 709 District Authorities, and over 2,000 Sub-Divisional Committees supported by more than 50,000 trained paralegal volunteers.

Justice Kant cited landmark Indian cases such as Hussainara Khatoon, which established the right to free legal representation for undertrial prisoners; NALSA v. Union of India, which recognised transgender persons as India’s third gender; and the Delhi Domestic Workers and Widows of Wundavan cases, which advanced victim-centred justice.

He also discussed innovations such as tele-law services, mobile legal aid units, and legal aid clinics in schools, noting that legal aid is not charity but a philosophy of justice essential for democracy, equality, and human dignity.

Bar Association of Sri Lanka President Rajeev Amarasuriya, addressing the gathering, said legal aid is both a constitutional duty and a democratic necessity.

He stressed that justice must be accessible to every citizen, especially marginalised and vulnerable communities, and described the oration as a platform for reflection and renewal of the legal community’s commitment to justice.

Citing Martin Luther King Jr., he reminded that “injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere” and urged the legal fraternity, civil society, and policymakers to strengthen access to justice through collective action.

Commonwealth Legal Education Association President Prof. Dr. S. Sivakumar said underscored the importance of regional collaboration and shared learning, pointing to global examples such as South Africa’s community paralegal movement and the Caribbean’s digital justice initiatives.

Legal Aid Commission of Sri Lanka Chairman V. Puvitharan, PC, highlighted the Commission’s work in expanding access to justice for women, children, the elderly, and marginalised groups. He also emphasised the value of pro bono service, mentorship, and legal education in empowering citizens and upholding dignity.

The event, organised by the BASL Human Rights Committee in partnership with CLEA, marked the beginning of an annual tradition to promote dialogue on justice, inclusivity, and the rule of law in Sri Lanka, reaffirming the Commonwealth’s shared values of education and collaboration.
