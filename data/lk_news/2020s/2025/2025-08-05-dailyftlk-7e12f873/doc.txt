Telco giant Dialog Axiata PLC together with MAS Holdings, an apparel manufacturing and technology conglomerate, have successfully concluded the third consecutive Dialog MAS Enabler Program, reaffirming their shared commitment to workplace inclusivity and the empowerment of persons with disabilities through targeted exposure to real-world corporate, manufacturing, and service environments.

Held from 23 June to 7 July, the two-week program enabled selected undergraduates and young professionals with disabilities to spend time at Dialog and MAS. Participants engaged across corporate offices, customer-facing service centres, and manufacturing facilities, receiving guided briefings on corporate culture and gaining hands-on exposure to the operations of both organisations.

The sessions combined theoretical learning and practical experiences, covering workplace etiquette, the hiring process, interview preparation, career development, and department-specific forums led by industry experts. In addition to technical and operational insights, participants also developed vital soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and leadership—key competencies that support long-term professional growth and integration into dynamic work environments.

As a progression from last year’s initiative, Dialog introduced a pilot pre-employment training program at its call centre to equip persons with disabilities for potential career opportunities. Additionally, the Inclusive Champions Program was launched to foster internal awareness and advocacy for disability inclusion across the organisation.

“This program is a step towards integrating persons with disabilities into real work environments where they gain insight into workplace culture, day-to-day operations, and the expectations of a professional setting. It helps bridge the gap between academic learning and practical experience, giving participants clarity on the skills and opportunities they may want to pursue to shape and build their careers. We’re proud to partner in an initiative that takes inclusion from policy to action,” said MAS Holdings Director – Group Sustainable Business Nemanthie Kooragamage.

“The Dialog MAS Enabler Program reflects our purpose-driven approach to inclusion—offering exposure, mentorship, and practical experiences that prepare persons with disabilities for meaningful careers,” said Dialog Axiata Group Chief Corporate Officer Asanga Priyadarshana. “We are proud to collaborate with MAS Holdings in advancing this important initiative and setting a benchmark for workplace equity and accessibility in Sri Lanka.”

Dialog and MAS remain committed to building inclusive, diverse workplaces where all individuals—regardless of ability—are given equal opportunities to thrive. By combining real-world exposure with meaningful mentorship, both organisations continue to drive systemic change, empower underrepresented talent, and lead by example in fostering an inclusive corporate culture across Sri Lanka.
