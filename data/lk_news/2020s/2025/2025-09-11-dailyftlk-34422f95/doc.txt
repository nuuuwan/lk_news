Sri Lanka to ratify UN High Seas Biodiversity Treaty

Cabinet Spokesperson and Health and Mass Media Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said yesterday the Cabinet approved ratification of the agreement under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction.

He said Cabinet had already granted approval in December 2024 for Sri Lanka to sign the agreement and establish an inter-ministerial committee. Sri Lanka signed the agreement on 20 February 2025.

“If Sri Lanka is among the first 60 countries to ratify, we will benefit from strengthened conservation of ocean resources, sustainable use, and fair distribution of returns,” Dr. Jayatissa said.
