World GDP forecasts raised, but evidence of US slowdown rises: Fitch

ECONOMYNEXT – Fitch Ratings has raised its world growth forecasts for the year since the June Global Economic Outlook (GEO) on better-than-expected incoming data for 2Q25, but expects world GDP to slow significantly this year, it said.

“There is now evidence of an underlying US slowdown in ‘hard’ economic data and positive surprises on eurozone growth have partly reflected US tariff front-running,” the ratings agency said.

Global growth is now forecast to be 2.4 percent in 2025, Fitch said.

This is up 0.2pp since June, but is a ‘sizeable’ slowdown from 2.9 percent last year and below trend.

China’s forecast has been raised to 4.7 percent from 4.2 percent, the eurozone’s to 1.1 percent from 0.8 percent and the US’s to 1.6 percent from 1.5 percent.

“There has been a reduction in uncertainty over US tariff policy after a flurry of announcements.

“Our latest estimate of the average US effective tariff rate (ETR) is 16%, very close to the rate assumed in June.

“Mexico and Canada face lower ETRs, due to better USMCA compliance and Europe’s ETR is also slightly lower, but this is offset by higher-than-expected rates for Asia excluding China.” (Colombo/Sep15/2025)
