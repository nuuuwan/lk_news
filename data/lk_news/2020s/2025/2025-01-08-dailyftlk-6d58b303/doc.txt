SJB to take important decisions today

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) is to take some important political decisions at its management committee meeting to be held in Colombo today (8 Jan).

SJB General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara told the Daily FT that the party will meet today to take some important political decisions including local government elections.

He said that some new faces would be included in some of SJB’s posts and they would discuss on restructuring the SJB as well.

When asked about a merger between the SJB and the United National Party, he said it was too early to comment.
