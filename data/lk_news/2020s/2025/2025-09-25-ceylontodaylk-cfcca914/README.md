# Sachithra Senanayake Indicted Under Sports Corruption Act

Former Sri Lanka cricketer Sachithra Senanayake has been formally indicted under the Prevention of Sports-Related Corruption Act on charges linked to alleged match-fixing, the Attorney General’s Department confirmed.

The case was taken up before the Hambantota High Court, where indictments were officially served. The court ordered Senanayake to provide his fingerprints and released him on two personal bail bonds of Rs. 1 million each.

The charges stem from incidents during the Lanka Premier League (LPL) matches held between November 21 and 22, 2020.

Senanayake is accused of attempting to influence Colombo Kings player Tarindu Ratnayake, allegedly persuading him not to report a corrupt approach to the International Cricket Council’s Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU). He is further alleged to have provided guidance and encouragement to support the concealment of the offer.
