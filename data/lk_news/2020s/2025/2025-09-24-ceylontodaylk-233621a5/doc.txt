ICC suspends USA Cricket’s membership

The International Cricket Council (ICC) has suspended USA Cricket’s membership with immediate effect, citing repeated breaches of its constitutional obligations and failure to meet governance standards.

The decision, announced on September 23, follows a year-long review and engagement with key stakeholders. The ICC Board concluded that USA Cricket had failed to implement a functional governance structure, made no progress toward recognition by the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC), and contributed to reputational damage to the sport both domestically and globally.

Despite the suspension, the ICC confirmed that USA’s national teams will continue to participate in ICC events, including preparations for the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games (LA28). To ensure continuity, the ICC and its designated representatives will temporarily oversee the management and administration of USA’s national squads.

The ICC emphasized that the move is aimed at safeguarding the long-term interests of the sport and protecting athletes. A Normalization Committee, supported by ICC management, will now outline the steps required for USA Cricket’s reinstatement. These include demonstrable reforms in governance, operations, and compliance with ICC membership criteria.

USA Cricket was previously placed “on notice” at the 2024 ICC Annual General Meeting and given 12 months to address its non-compliance. The suspension follows continued failure to meet those conditions, despite commitments made to the ICC Board earlier this year.

The ICC reiterated its commitment to supporting cricket’s growth in the United States and ensuring the sport’s Olympic ambitions remain intact.
