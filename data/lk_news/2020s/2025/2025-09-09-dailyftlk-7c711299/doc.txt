BASL, CSSL to strengthen ties between technology and law

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) yesterday said it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to foster collaboration with the Computer Society of Sri Lanka (CSSL).

Under the MoU, CSSL commits to providing technical expertise to support BASL’s IT initiatives, digital transformation, and capacity-building projects. In return, BASL will extend its legal capacity-building creating a mutually beneficial partnership.

This collaboration reflects a shared vision to integrate the strengths of both organisations, ensuring that BASL and CSSL remain responsive to the evolving needs of their members and the nation. Together, they aim to drive innovation, elevate professional standards, and promote growth within Sri Lanka’s ICT and legal communities.

BASL President Rajeev Amarasuriya and Secretary Chathura A. Galhena signed the MOU with CSSL President Heshan Karunaratne and Secretary Udesh I.W. Seneviratna. Exco members of both BASL and CSSL were present at the signing ceremony, marking this important milestone in strengthening ties between the two sectors.

The MoU aims to bridge the gap between the technology and legal sectors by sharing expertise and resources.
