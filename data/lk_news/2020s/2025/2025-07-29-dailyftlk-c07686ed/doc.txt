Red warrant obtained against Royal Park convict: AG

The Attorney General (AG) informed the Supreme Court on Sunday that authorities have obtained a red warrant for the arrest of Jude Shramantha Jayamaha, who was sentenced to death in connection with the Royal Park murder case.

The State Counsel who appeared for the AG made this revelation when a Fundamental Rights petition challenging former President Sirisena’s decision to grant a Presidential Pardon to Jayamaha was called before the Supreme Court. The petition was taken up before the Supreme Court to evaluate the progress of implementing the Court order. On 6 June 2024, the Supreme Court ruled that former President Maithripala Sirisena’s decision to grant a Presidential Pardon to Royal Park murder convict Don Shramantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha was arbitrary and invalid in law. The Court further directed the AG and all relevant authorities to take the necessary steps to arrange Jayamaha’s extradition, as he is considered a convict on death row.

President’s Counsel Sanjeeva Jayawardena, with Counsel Rukshan Senadheera, appeared for the petitioner. President’s Counsel Saliya Peiris appeared for the Bar Association of Sri Lanka.
