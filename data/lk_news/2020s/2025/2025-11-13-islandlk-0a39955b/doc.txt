ComBank posts impactful 9-month results with strong loan book growth

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon group has reported gross income of Rs. 268.49 Bn. and net interest income of Rs. 103.48 Bn. at the end of the third quarter of 2025, with strong year-on-year growth of 34.60% in the loan book and curtailed interest expenses contributing to an impressive nine-month performance.

Comprising of Sri Lanka’s largest private sector bank, its subsidiaries and an associate, the Group reported in a filing with the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) that interest income grew by 6.96% to Rs. 221.53 Bn. for the nine months ending 30th September 2025, while interest expenses for the period remained static at Rs. 118.05 Bn. as a result of the lower cost of funds and continuing improvement in the CASA ratio.

Consequently, net interest income at Rs. 103.48 Bn. for the nine months reviewed, grew by 16.30% in contrast to the 11.08% growth in gross income. In the third quarter, gross income grew by 16.37% to Rs. 91.46 Bn., while interest income for the three months improved by 10.35% to Rs. 74.88 Bn., with the loan book growing by 10.14% at a monthly average of Rs. 58.51 Bn.

“Our commitment to lending remains undiminished, because we believe that our capacity to support national economic growth targets must be fully leveraged within prudential limits” said Sharhan Muhseen, Chairman of Commercial Bank. “The group’s performance reflects the impacts of this approach, and we expect similar strong growth in the final quarter of the year, in line with the trajectory of economic and business recovery.”

Sanath Manatunge, Managing Director/CEO of Commercial Bank said the Bank’s ability to sustain growth in the loan book backed by a focus on yield management and cost optimization helped the Bank to post these strong results for the nine months reviewed. He said that the Bank maintained a strong focus on the CASA ratio, which stood at 39.92% as at 30th September 2025, compared to 38.07% at end December 2024 and 39.60% a year ago, helping the Bank to keep the cost of funds under control.

Total operating income increased by 21.41% to Rs. 140.49 Bn. for the nine months while the Group’s impairment charges and other losses for the period declined by 28.21% to Rs. 14.37 Bn., primarily due to the previous year’s figure including an additional provisioning for the Sri Lanka International Sovereign Bonds (SLISBs) held by the Bank. For the third quarter of 2025, the Group reported a total operating income of Rs. 47.74 Bn., an improvement of 24.13%.

The Group posted a net operating income of Rs. 126.13 Bn. for the nine months, reflecting an impressive growth of 31.79%, while keeping operating expenses at Rs. 39.41 Bn., an increase of only 8.00%, resulting in operating profit before taxes on financial services growing by a noteworthy 46.46% to Rs. 86.71 Bn.
