Sri Lanka apparel exports dip in August 2025: JAAF

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) noted a marginal decline in monthly exports in August 2025, compared to the same period last year.

“In August 2025, total apparel exports stood at US$ 479.14 million, reflecting a 1.33% decrease compared to August 2024,” JAAF said in a statement.

“The month of August reflects the volatility in global markets, with pressure on exports to the EU and UK,” JAAF said.

Exports to the USA recorded a modest gain of 0.92 percent, while shipments to the EU and UK saw declines of 4.83 percent and 2.6 percent.

“Despite the August dip, the sector maintained positive momentum over the January–August 2025 period.”

Total exports grew by 7.48 percent to 3.39 billion dollars, JAAF said, compared with 3.16 billion dollars during the same period in 2024.

“This growth was underpinned by strong demand from the EU (up 14.66%), supported by gains in the USA (2.58%), the UK (4.54%), and other markets (9.45%).”

JAAF said it will work with policymakers and stakeholders to ensure the country’s apparel industry maintains stability and captures emerging opportunities in an uncertain global environment.

“The industry continues to face challenges, but remains focused on competitiveness, diversification, and sustained engagement with key trading partners.” (Colombo/Sep26/2025)
