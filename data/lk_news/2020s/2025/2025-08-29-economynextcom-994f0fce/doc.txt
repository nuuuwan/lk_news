If you don’t know your market, don’t grow: Sri Lanka agri minister tells farmers

ECONOMYNEXT – Farmers shouldn’t grow produce if they don’t know the market, Sri Lanka’s Minister of Agriculture and Lands has said.

“IF you don’t know the market, don’t grow [Api kiyanne velandapola danne neththam vaga karanna epa],” Kuragamage Don Lalkantha said.

He said he had asked pumpkin farmers recently who they grew it for. “They don’t know who their buyers are.”

“We say, grow produce knowing who you will sell it to, and at what price.

But they must know if they are selling to supermarkets or for export, he said, and meet with buyers beforehand.

“Then no one will be left helpless [kavuruth anatha ven neha]”.

He said the government hopes to solve all farmer problems by 2028. (Colombo/Aug29/2025)
