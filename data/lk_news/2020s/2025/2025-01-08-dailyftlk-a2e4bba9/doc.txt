Rishad says SL should adhere to intl. humanitarian principles regarding Rohingya refugees

Writes to President emphasising need to follow principle of non-refoulement

Says ACMC has serious concern regarding decision to repatriate Rohingya refugees

Urges President to reconsider decision to forcibly return Rohingya refugees to Myanmar

All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) Leader and Parliamentarian Rishad Bathiudeen has urged the Government to adhere to international humanitarian principles and consider the well-being of the Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, who have fled persecution in their homeland.

Writing a letter to President Anura Kumara Dissanayeke, Bathiudeen has stated that the Government must ensure that its actions align with international laws and conventions on refugees, which emphasise the principle of non-refoulement – the prohibition of sending individuals back to places where they face threats to their lives or freedom.

“By upholding this principle, Sri Lanka will not only protect the rights of these vulnerable individuals but also demonstrate its commitment to international humanitarian standards”, he has stated adding that the ACMC has a serious concern regarding the decision to repatriate the Rohingya refugees currently seeking asylum in Sri Lanka.

According to Bathiudeen, the Rohingya people have sought refuge in Sri Lanka due to severe violence, fear and oppression in Myanmar and not economic migrants and it is the right time for Sri Lanka to show that as a nation that values human rights and dignity to offer them protection during their time of vulnerability.

He explained in his letter that by upholding the principle of non-refoulement, Sri Lanka will not only protect the rights of these vulnerable individuals but also demonstrate its commitment to international humanitarian standards.

“I urge the President to reconsider the decision to forcibly return these people to Myanmar, where their safety and human rights are still at risk,” he said requesting to treat them with respect and dignity while they remain in Sri Lanka.

Bathiudeen in this letter has stated that the Rohingya refugees should not be treated as prisoners but as people in need of our compassion and support while collaborating with the UN to identify a suitable third country where these refugees can resettle, with their consent, once it is deemed safe for them.
