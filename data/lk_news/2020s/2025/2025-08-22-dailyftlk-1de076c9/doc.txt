Cabinet clears construction of new Wattuwakal bridge on A035 highway

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved awarding the construction contract for the new Wattuwakal Bridge (Bridge No. 50/1) on the Paranthan–Karatchi–Mullaitivu (A035) highway to M/s RR Construction Ltd., the lowest substantially responsive bidder.

The decision follows recommendations by the Higher Level Standing Procurement Committee, which evaluated the bids received under the national competitive bidding process.

The Wattuwakal Bridge, located across the Nandikadal Lagoon, was last renovated in 2009, but is now deemed structurally insecure. To address safety and connectivity concerns, the Road Development Authority (RDA) has planned to replace it with a new two-lane bridge.

The proposal was presented to the Cabinet by Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation Minister Bimal Rathnayake.
