National Policy on Senior Citizens to be revised

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved updating the country’s National Policy on Senior Citizens, first introduced in 2006.

The revision comes in response to shifting global and domestic demographic trends. According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the proportion of Sri Lankans aged 60 years and above is projected to rise to 24.8% by 2052. As a result, this demographic shift demands stronger measures to safeguard the welfare and rights of senior citizens.

The updated national policy is designed to enable older citizens to live with dignity in supportive social, economic, physical, and spiritual environments. Developed under the theme “Respectful Senior Citizen – Meaningful Retirement”, the framework emphasises both protection and empowerment, aligning with the Government’s broader policy priorities.

Addressing the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing  on Tuesday, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said the new approach seeks to ensure that Sri Lanka’s ageing population remains integrated and active in society, while also strengthening systems that provide care and protection for vulnerable elderly groups.

He said the move underscores the Government’s recognition that addressing the needs of senior citizens is central to long-term social protection and inclusive development in the country.

The proposal to this effect was submitted by Rural Development, Social Protection and Community Empowerment Minister Dr. Upali Pannilage.
