Sahasdhanavi clarifies power plant tariff, stresses vital role in energy security

Sahasdhanavi Ltd has responded to recent discussions on its power plant’s levelised tariff, emphasising its importance in Sri Lanka’s energy stability as per the approved Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan (LTGEP). By issuing a press release, the company highlights following facts for policymakers and the public: to broaden the scope and inclusivity of the discussion.

The 350 MW RLNG/Diesel plant was awarded through an International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in 2021, with Sahasdhanavi submitting the lowest bid. After securing Cabinet and PUCSL approval by December 2023, project delays arose due to national circumstances.

Reliable 24/7 power: 318 MW (diesel) or 350 MW (LNG) on demand, with >90% availability (penalties apply if unmet).

Energy Charge: Based on actual usage (~Rs. 57/kWh for diesel, ~Rs. 33/kWh for LNG).

Fuel-linked tariffs: Final costs in 2028 will adjust to market prices.

Is theoretical, based on RFP assumptions (fixed fuel prices, exchange rates).

The PUCSL approved the tariff and PPA on 1 April 2025, with additional endorsement from the Attorney General’s Department.

A comparable Battery Storage System (BESS) would cost USD 1.75–2.2 billion (~6x more) with Rs. 37/kWh standby charges.

“This plant is a strategic asset for energy security,” the spokesperson stated. “The levelised tariff is purely for bid evaluation – actual costs depend on real-world factors. We urge policymakers and the public to recognise the project’s vital role,” Sahasdhanavi spokesperson said.
