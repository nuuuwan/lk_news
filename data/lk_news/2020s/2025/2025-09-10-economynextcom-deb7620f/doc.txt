Sri Lanka expresses ‘concern’ over Israel strikes on Qatar

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a brief statement expressing “concern” over Israel’s strikes on Qatar, without naming the aggressor.

“Sri Lanka expresses deep concern over the recent strikes reported in Qatar, which might further escalate volatility and undermine regional security,” the ministry said in its 2-sentence statement, a day after the Israeli attack in Qatar’s capital, Doha.

“Sri Lanka emphasizes the need for restraint and to be committed to diplomatic dialogue towards peace and stability in the region while upholding universally accepted international norms and laws.”

The act of war drew swift condemnation from across the region and beyond, with the United Nations chief calling it a “flagrant violation” of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Qatar. (Colombo/Sep10/2025)
