Sri Lanka to resume Narahenpita, Torrington housing projects

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet of ministers has approved a proposal to resume halted housing projects at Colombage Mawatha in Narahenpita and Torrington, minister Nalinda Jayatissa said.

“The estimated cost for the implementation of these projects is 7.48 billion rupees,” Jayatissa told reporters.

The Narahenpita Colombage Mawatha scheme was supposed to have 615 units, while the Torrington Mawatha scheme was to have 115 housing units.

“It is expected that it will take about 2 years to complete the construction work.”

The proposal to allocate the necessary provisions for the implementation of these projects from 2026 to 2028 was approved by the cabinet, Jayatissa said.

The two housing projects which were commenced under the urban revitalization project were stopped halfway when the country faced an economic crisis. (Colombo/Aug5/2025)
