U.S. aviation agency to fine Boeing 3.1 mln USD over safety violations

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has proposed fining Boeing 3.1 million U.S. dollars over safety violations from September 2023 to February 2024.

Hundreds of quality system breaches were identified at Boeing’s 737 factory in Renton, Washington, and Boeing subcontractor Spirit AeroSystems’ 737 factory in Wichita, Kansas, said the FAA on Friday.

The transportation agency said the violations were linked to an accident on an Alaska Airlines jetliner in which it lost a door plug panel on its fuselage in midflight.

In a statement, Boeing said that it is reviewing the agency’s proposed civil penalty and that the company had put in place a safety and quality plan last year aimed at enhancing safety management and quality assurance.
