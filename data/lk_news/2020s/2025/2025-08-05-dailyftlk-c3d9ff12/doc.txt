Supreme Court dismisses petitions challenging Sri Lanka-India MoUs

The Supreme Court yesterday dismissed two Fundamental Rights petitions that sought to invalidate the recent Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) signed between Sri Lanka and India.

A two-judge bench comprising Justice Achala Wengappuli and Justice Priyantha Fernando ruled that there was no prima facie case to proceed with the applications. As a result, the petitions were dismissed without further hearing.

The petitions had challenged the legality of seven MoUs exchanged on 5 April at the Presidential Secretariat. These agreements, signed in the presence of President Anura Kumara Disanayake and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, cover areas including defence cooperation, digital solutions, and a multi-sectoral grant assistance initiative for the Eastern Province.

Presidentâ€™s Counsel Manohara de Silva and Senior Counsel Canishka Witharana appeared for the petitioners. Deputy Solicitor General Nirmalan Wigneswaran represented the Attorney General.
