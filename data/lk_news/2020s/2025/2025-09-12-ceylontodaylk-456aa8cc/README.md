# Deleting MV X-Press Pearl data: Two IT officials granted bail

Two officials from the IT division of the local representative company of the MV X-Press Pearl were released on bail yesterday (11) over allegations of deleting the ship’s data system and emails following its destruction off Sri Lanka’s coast four years ago.

Colombo Additional Magistrate Oshadha Migara Mahaarchchi granted each suspect two personal bail bonds of Rs 2.5 million and imposed a travel ban.

The suspects – Prasanna Jayawardena, Director of IT, and Roshan Senaviratne, Deputy Director of IT at Sea Consortium Lanka – were arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and produced in Court yesterday (11).

Deputy Solicitor General Madhawa Tennakoon, appearing for the Attorney General, informed the Court that a forensic examination conducted by the University of Colombo’s Department of Computer Science had revealed that the two suspects were responsible for deleting the vessel’s data system. He added that the Government plans to conduct a further forensic investigation with the assistance of a foreign university, pending Cabinet approval.

The Defence Counsel appearing for the suspects argued that the CID had already recorded several statements from his clients and noted that other suspects in the case had been released on bail. He therefore requested the Court to grant bail to the two IT officials as well.

After considering submissions, the Additional Magistrate ordered the release of the two suspects on bail.

The case will be taken up again on 24 September at 2:00 p.m.
