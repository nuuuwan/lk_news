AI brings new sparkle to Sri Lankan gem trade

In a significant boost to Sri Lanka’s historic gemstone trade, local traders can now harness the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to instantly certify and assess the quality of their stones, thanks to a groundbreaking new technology launched in the island’s key trading hubs.

The revolutionary system, a result of a partnership between global digital engineering firm Fcode Labs and gemstone scanning innovator Porolis, has been deployed at centres in Beruwala, Colombo, and Rathnapura. This move puts laboratory-grade analysis directly into the hands of gemologists and traders, modernising a centuries-old industry that has long relied on manual, time-consuming methods.

The technology combines the KROMA scanning device, invented by Porolis, with the cloud-based GemLUX AIaaS platform. This allows professionals to digitally scan a gemstone and receive an immediate, AI-driven analysis, complete with a detailed digital report accessible through a secure online dashboard.

This leap forward addresses key industry challenges by introducing new levels of speed, accuracy, and transparency to the gem certification process, reducing reliance on subjective human assessment.

Fcode Labs was responsible for developing the entire software infrastructure, including the user-friendly scanning interface and the scalable cloud platform for managing data. Porolis provided its proprietary AI model and expertise in advanced optical engineering to power the analysis.

Vincent Wong, the CEO of Porolis, praised the collaboration, stating, “The project team’s ability to translate our complex requirements into a user-friendly solution was particularly impressive.”

Echoing this sentiment, Pansuja Senevirathne, Project Lead for the GemLUX platform at Fcode Labs, said, “This collaboration brings together world-class hardware and software to solve a deeply practical problem. It’s a perfect example of how emerging technologies can modernise traditional industries.”

The installation of these AI-powered centres marks a pivotal moment for Sri Lanka’s gemstone sector, empowering local traders with state-of-the-art tools to enhance trust, streamline sales, and solidify the country’s reputation as a leader in the global gem trade.
