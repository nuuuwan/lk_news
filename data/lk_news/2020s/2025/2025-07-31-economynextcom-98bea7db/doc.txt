Sri Lanka stocks close up after initial selling pressure

ECONOMYNEXT – The Colombo Stock Exchange rallied to close up on Thursday, after seeing some selling pressure in the morning, brokers said.

“In the morning the market was down because there was a bit of selling pressure coming in on the back of all the negative publicity surrounding John Keells,” Dimantha Mathew, Chief Research and Strategy Officer at First Capital Holdings PLC said.

“This brought the overall market sentiment down. But buying interest was strong and market ended on a positive note.”

The ASPI was up 0.39 percent, or 76.33 points, at 19,642.48; while the S&P SL20 was up 0.18 percent, or 10.49 points, at 5,762.17.

Market turnover was 5.66 billion rupees. Most of this came from bank stocks (1.5 billion rupees), capital goods stocks (1.3 billion rupees), Food, Beverage & Tobacco Industry (883 million rupees) and diversified financials (578 million rupees).

There was a lot of retail activity despite the negative publicity with investors “not too disturbed”, Mathew said.

John Keells Holdings closed 20 cents weaker at 23.90 rupees.

Top contributors to the ASPI were Hayleys which closed up 7.75 rupees at 187.50, DFCC Bank which closed up 6 rupees at 146.25, Browns Investments which was up 20 cents at 7.90 rupees, National Development Bank which was up 1.50 rupees at 137.00, and Commercial Credit and Finance which was up 8 rupees at 113.75.
