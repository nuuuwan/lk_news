AIA Insurance highlights self-worth and wellbeing

As part of its groundbreaking ‘Rethink Healthy’ campaign, AIA Insurance continues to shift conventional health narratives through a four-part podcast series created in partnership with the PodHUB. Each episode features inspiring Sri Lankans who are challenging outdated wellness ideals and demonstrating that health is about much more than diet and exercise.

Adhisha Dahanayake, a fashion entrepreneur and national powerlifter, is featured in Episode 3. She has redefined what strength and health mean to her and many other women. Listeners are inspired to adopt a more holistic perspective of well-being—one that encompasses mental, emotional, and self-worth-driven health—by her honest and unfiltered story.

Double XL, a plus-size fashion brand she launched in 2010 in response to her personal difficulties obtaining clothing in her size, lies at the heart of her journey. A social movement that promoted the idea that “inclusivity is not optional, it’s essential” grew out of what started as a personal struggle. In a society where plus-size bodies are frequently linked to unhealthy lifestyles, Adhisha’s goal was to dispel the taboo around body size and encourage body confidence. In addition to promoting the mental and emotional well-being of those who had long been excluded from mainstream fashion, her brand became a beacon for them.
