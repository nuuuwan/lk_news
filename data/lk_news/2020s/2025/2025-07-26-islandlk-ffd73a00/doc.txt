Network In Action makes its Lankan debut with launch event in Colombo

The global business networking platform, Network In Action (NIA), officially launched its Sri Lanka chapter at an exclusive event held at Cinnamon Grand, Colombo. The invite-only evening brought together a selected group of entrepreneurs, professionals, and business leaders from across industries. Hosted by NIA’s Sri Lanka Regional Partners, Jayathas Kamalanathan and Pamatheesan Kopalapillai, the launch offered a firsthand experience of how NIA operates and what sets its networking model apart from conventional approaches. The event kicked off at 6 p.m. on 9 July, and featured a keynote presentation from the leadership team, followed by a live demonstration of an NIA-style group session.

“Sri Lanka has no shortage of talented entrepreneurs and professionals. What many are looking for is a consistent way to grow, surrounded by the right people. That’s exactly what we’re building with NIA Colombo.” said Jayathas Kamalanathan. Pamatheesan Kopalapillai noted, “This isn’t about selling or self-promotion. It’s about real connections that lead to real growth.”
