Discuss plans for introduction of smart multi-facility privilege program for Council membership

Sri Lanka Business Council (SLBC) UAE – Dubai and Northern Emirates Chairman Suren Swaminathan, who was on a brief visit to Colombo met with CH17 Loyalty Founder and CEO Jumar Preena recently.

The meeting centred around strategic collaboration to implement a multi-facility membership privilege program exclusively for the Business Council membership.

During the meeting, Preena also outlined CH17’s intention to launch the first-ever dual-country rewards and privilege program tailored for the Sri Lankan expatriate community in the UAE.

The initiative will be a milestone in cross-border loyalty management and is envisioned to serve two key objectives: Support Sri Lankan-owned micro and SME retail businesses in the UAE by granting them access to targeted Sri Lankan customer segments and enabling long-term brand loyalty through structured digital engagement and Provide Sri Lankan expatriates with exclusive privileges and discounts when patronising these businesses, thereby fostering a meaningful connection with homegrown brands.

CH17 will offer full technical support including software integration with participating retailers’ POS systems, ensuring seamless customer engagement and transaction-based loyalty authentication.

As part of the platform benefits, registered Sri Lankan users will also enjoy privileges and discounts with Colombo-based retail partners under the CH17 network. A key highlight will be exclusive access to The Mall at Port City Colombo, including benefits at the prestigious Singapore-owned One Duty Free (ODF) outlet.

This collaborative initiative positions CH17 Loyalty as a pioneer in facilitating borderless loyalty solutions while reinforcing SLBC’s role in empowering Sri Lankan businesses in the UAE through digital transformation.
