Pussalla Agri Ventures makes strategic investment in Sri Lanka’s spice tourism landscape

Pussalla Agri Ventures recently announced the grand opening of the first dedicated Ceylon Cinnamon outlet in Narigama, Hikkaduwa. This new establishment marks a significant step in the company’s mission to elevate the global profile of authentic Ceylon Cinnamon.

More than a traditional retail space, the outlet is designed as an immersive experience center. Visitors can explore the full range of premium, value-added Pussalla cinnamon products, including quills, powders and essential oils. A key feature is the opportunity for guests to enjoy a freshly prepared cinnamon brew, engaging the senses and highlighting the product’s heritage and wellness benefits.

This strategic launch capitalises on growing international consumer demand for natural, safe, and premium products. Ceylon Cinnamon renowned for its purity and superior quality, is perfectly positioned within this trend. The outlet serves as a direct channel to offer travelers and connoisseurs a guaranteed authentic source of this prized spice.

The opening aligned with Pussalla Agri Ventures’ broader commitment to strengthening Sri Lanka’s cinnamon value chain. This forward-thinking initiative emphasises value addition and economic resilience within the agricultural sector, contributing to national efforts to increase foreign exchange revenue.

All products featured at the new outlet are conceptualised and manufactured at the company’s state-of-the-art processing facility in Kosgama, ensuring complete control over quality, from source to final product.
