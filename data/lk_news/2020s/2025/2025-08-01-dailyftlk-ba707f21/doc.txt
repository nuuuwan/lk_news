Story of Wa’el Zuaiter comes alive in Colombo today

A compelling one-person theatrical performance, ‘For a Palestinian,’ is set to grace the stage of the Namel Malini Punchi Theatre in Colombo today (1) at 7:30 p.m.

This timely production offers a moving exploration of the life and legacy of Wa’el Zuaiter, a Palestinian intellectual and activist whose story remains largely obscured in mainstream historical narratives.

Set in Rome during the 1960s, Zuaiter’s life becomes a lens through which the audience is invited to examine themes of identity, exile, heritage, and the enduring human need for connection and justice. His narrative, one of quiet resistance, cultural preservation, and personal longing, is rendered with powerful intimacy by performer Murthaaz Abdul Barry.

Written by Bilal Hasna and Aaron Kilercioglu, and directed by Akmal Hamid, ‘For a Palestinian’ is more than a biographical tribute. It is a deeply human meditation on the Palestinian experience, both past and present, brought to life through striking theatrical minimalism and emotional depth.

At a time when the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to unfold with heartbreaking urgency, the production serves as both a cultural offering and a call to conscience. Audiences are reminded that behind every statistic lies a story, and behind every story, a life.

Admission is by donation, with a minimum contribution of Rs. 1,500 per person, and all proceeds will be directed towards humanitarian relief efforts in Gaza, coordinated by United for Good SL.

For those seeking to engage with Palestine’s ongoing narrative through art and reflection, ‘For a Palestinian’ offers a vital and resonant theatrical experience.
