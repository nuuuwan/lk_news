CEAT Kelani presents traffic management tools to Police and SLCMP

CEAT Kelani Holdings has broadened the scope of its flagship community initiative promoting road safety around schools by engaging with the Police and the Sri Lanka Corps of Military Police (SLCMP) of the Sri Lanka Army, two institutions that play lead roles in this domain.

The company recently presented stocks of traffic management-related signboards and traffic cones to these institutions, as one of its community commitments that makes up the ‘CEAT Cares’ portfolio of community projects.

The signboards and traffic cones presented to the Police and the Military police are to be strategically placed on main roads to facilitate traffic management near schools, government institutions, and other high-traffic areas within the station’s jurisdiction, supporting CEAT’s efforts to help improve road safety and aid law enforcement maintain smooth traffic flows.
