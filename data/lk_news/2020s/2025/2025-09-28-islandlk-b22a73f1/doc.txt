SLIC Life’s nationwide education initiatives earn top CSR honour

Sri Lanka Insurance Life (SLIC Life) has been recognized for ‘Excellence in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)’ at the prestigious Sri Lanka Leadership Awards 2025. The company received the award for “Support and Improvement in Quality of Education” during a ceremony held on September 10th at the Taj Samudra, Colombo, organized by CMO Asia.

This accolade underscores SLIC Life’s deep-rooted commitment to national development through education, aligning with its brand promise, “Like a Father, Like a Mother.” Education is a central pillar of its CSR strategy, which focuses on creating tangible, long-term impact for communities across the country.

A cornerstone of this effort is the “Pasal Piriyatha Surakimu” initiative, launched in 2007 to strengthen underprivileged schools. This nationwide program has now benefited over 3,365 schools through vital infrastructure improvements. These include classroom refurbishments, providing clean drinking water, repairing furniture, and donating books and essentials. In its most recent phase in May 2025, the program revitalized 100 schools simultaneously with the support of the company’s island-wide network.

Complementing this community-focused work is the Suba Pathum Scholarship Program, established in 2014 to support the educational aspirations of policyholders’ children. To date, this initiative has awarded over Rs. 240 million in financial scholarships to more than 2,200 high-achieving students at national examinations. In 2025 alone, 225 students who excelled at the Grade 5, O/L, and A/L examinations were honoured.

Together, these programs demonstrate a holistic approach to educational support: uplifting the learning environment for entire communities while directly empowering individual students.
