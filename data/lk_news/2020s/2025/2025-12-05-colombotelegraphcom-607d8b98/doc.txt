Institutional Failures Exacerbated Impact Of Cyclone Ditwah

Sri Lanka is once again grappling with the devastating consequences of a natural disaster that, despite weeks of scientific forecasts, struck a nation structurally unprepared to withstand it. Cyclone Ditwah, which made landfall in late November 2025, has become the country’s most destructive calamity since the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. With fatalities surpassing 400, thousands still missing and more than one million people affected, this tragedy is not merely a force of nature it is a reflection of long standing systemic vulnerabilities.

For decades, Sri Lanka has struggled to translate scientific warnings, administrative planning and national unity into effective action. This disaster highlights a sobering reality unless deep rooted governance challenges and unresolved political questions are addressed, the nation will remain exposed to repeated cycles of crisis whether environmental, economic or social.

Cyclone Ditwah unleashed more than 500 mm of rainfall in parts of the central highlands within 24 hours. Rivers overflowed, reservoirs breached capacity and entire neighbourhoods were swallowed by landslides. Over 100000 people remain in temporary shelters and all 25 districts have reported significant damage.

• Central Highlands: Kandy, Badulla, Nuwara Eliya and Matale devastated by landslides

• Eastern and Northern Coasts: Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Mannar, Puttalam and parts of Jaffna submerged

• Western Province: Colombo and Gampaha experiencing their worst urban floods in decades

Images of families stranded on rooftops and homes swept away confirm how deeply vulnerable the country has become.

Meteorologists in Sri Lanka and India began issuing early warnings nearly two weeks in advance. International broadcasters, including the BBC, projected rainfall levels of 200 to 300 mm, with some models indicating the possibility of 500 mm.

Despite these alerts, national preparedness fell short. Key gaps included:

Forecasts existed, but they did not translate into strong ground level action. This reflects long standing institutional limitations rather than the failure of any single administration.

The armed forces played a crucial role in rescue operations. The Army cleared roads and moved survivors. The Navy reached marooned communities by boat. The Air Force airlifted stranded families. The Police coordinated shelters and public safety.

However, several communities reported delays before assistance arrived, especially in remote and rural areas. During the earliest hours of the disaster, immediate support came largely from local volunteers, temples, churches, mosques and civil society groups.

President Anura Kumara Dissanayakes call to rebuild a better nation from scratch has been positively received, but the challenge now lies in converting that sentiment into a long term, accountable and transparent resilience strategy.

Sri Lankas vulnerability is not merely geographic it is a structural issue linked to deeply centralised decision making and uneven development.

Unregulated hillside development, deforestation and poor land use planning have destabilised fragile ecosystems.

Disaster management bodies and local councils often lack modern equipment, trained personnel and real time communication tools.

A compulsory multilingual emergency alert system is still not operational.

Tamil speaking regions reported delayed warnings and slower relief coordination, demonstrating the need for inclusive national systems.

Land, forestry, environment and archaeology services remain constrained by outdated processes and slow administration.

Sri Lanka has faced a continuous cycle of crises over the past five decades including civil unrest, civil war, the 2004 tsunami, economic instability and repeated natural disasters. Each crisis has shown that national resilience requires strong institutions, equitable development and inclusive governance. Without these, the nation becomes increasingly fragile regardless of which administration is in office.

A centralised, capital driven administrative model is no longer adequate for a country facing intensifying climate pressures. Decision making must be decentralised, technically grounded and community driven. When all regions feel empowered and communities feel included, the nation becomes stronger as a whole.

Empower regional bodies to manage disaster preparedness, land, environment, agriculture and infrastructure.

A sustainable solution should include effective self governance in the North and East, protection of land and cultural rights, equitable treatment of all ethnic groups and meaningful devolution consistent with democratic principles.

A national coordinating mechanism with regional leadership can better manage development, investment and emergency response.

Clear guidelines are needed to prevent any faith from being used for political advantage.

Decentralised growth will attract investment, create jobs and balance national development.

President Dissanayake has a rare opportunity to initiate much needed reforms. By modernising early warning systems, strengthening institutions, enhancing provincial governance and addressing the Tamil question with clarity, he can rebuild national trust and resilience. If these reforms materialise, Sri Lanka can transform its vulnerabilities into a foundation for a more equitable and prosperous future.

Sri Lankas worst disaster since 2004 is a profound national tragedy but also a call for renewal. True resilience requires respect for science, strong institutions, regional empowerment, inclusive governance and a commitment to long term reform. Natural disasters may be unavoidable, but their impact can be significantly reduced. Sri Lankas future, its unity and its prosperity depend on embracing a governance model that is modern, inclusive and decentralised, while addressing long standing political questions with sincerity and vision.
