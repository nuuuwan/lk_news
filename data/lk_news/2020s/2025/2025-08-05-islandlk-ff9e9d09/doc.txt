Intex Sri Lanka 2025 set to ignite the textile & apparel world – A decade of impact, innovation & industry leadership

The energy is rising, the industry is watching, and the countdown has officially begun. From 6–8 August 2025, Colombo will once again become the epicentre of South Asia’s textile and apparel universe as Intex Sri Lanka returns with its most powerful edition yet. Celebrating a decade of innovation, trust, and transformation, the 17th edition of Intex Sri Lanka is more than an exhibition — it’s a movement that has shaped the sourcing future of the region.

Since its debut in 2015, Intex Sri Lanka has been a game-changer — bridging Sri Lanka’s world-renowned manufacturing strength with global textile producers and technology leaders.

Over the years, the show has become a strategic sourcing calendar event for buyers and industry leaders from across South Asia, ASEAN, MENA, and Europe. From fibres to fashion, processing to packaging, Intex delivers the full textile value chain — and this year, it’s taking it all a notch higher.
