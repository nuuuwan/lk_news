National Para team confident ahead of World Para Meet

Sri Lankaâ€™s Para athletics team, comprising five athletes, is ready to compete at the 12th World Para Athletics Championship, scheduled from September 27 to October 5 in New Delhi, India. The team will travel in three batches: the first leaves today (26), the second on September 28, and the third on October 2.

Palitha Bandara, the Commonwealth Games silver medalist in discus throw, will compete in the F-42/43 Shot Put event. Other senior athletes include Nuwan Indika (T-44 100m, 200m, long jump) and Pradeep Somasiri (T-46 1500m). The team also includes two female athletes: Janani Dhananjana (T-46 100m, long jump) and Buddhika Heshan (T-46 100m, long jump).
