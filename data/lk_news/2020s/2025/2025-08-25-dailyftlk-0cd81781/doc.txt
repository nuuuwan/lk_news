President’s Senior Economic Adviser Duminda Hulangamuwa to keynote Planters’ AGM on Friday

Senior Economic Adviser to the President Duminda Hulangamuwa is set to deliver the keynote address at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Planters’ Association of Ceylon (PA).

To be held on Friday, 29 August, the 171st AGM will bring together the membership of regional plantation companies, industry leaders, and key stakeholders to review the past year’s performance and deliberate on policies and strategies for growth.

Hulangamuwa’s address is expected to highlight Government priorities in policy direction and reforms while emphasising the facilities afforded to the residential population.

The AGM comes at a decisive moment for the plantation industry, which remains one of Sri Lanka’s largest sources of foreign exchange and rural employment. While tea continues to be Sri Lanka’s most prominent export crop, the RPCs are steadily diversifying into high-value categories such as coffee, avocado, berries, cinnamon, cardamom and cocoa. These efforts are intended to reduce dependency on traditional commodities and strengthen Sri Lanka’s position in premium international markets. Parallel investments in replanting, environmental certificaations and renewable energy projects – including solar power installations – demonstrate the sector’s long-term commitment to sustainability.

Established in 1854, the Planters’ Association has continuously represented the collective interests of Sri Lanka’s plantation industry for more than 170 years. Today, it brings together 23 Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) managing a substantial share of the nation’s tea, rubber, palm oil and spice plantations, as well as over 330 processing facilities. The sector provides direct employment to approximately 125,000 individuals and health and welfare services to a residential population of over one million.

Marking its 171st year, the Planters’ Association reaffirms its enduring role in safeguarding the industry’s global reputation, championing innovation and sustainability, and contributing to national economic growth. The AGM is expected to bring together policymakers, industry leaders and stakeholders to chart a path for the plantation sector to thrive in an evolving global marketplace.
