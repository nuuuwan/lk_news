Trump says Canada recognition of Palestine hurts trade deal

ECONOMYNEXT – US President Donald Trump has said it would be harder to make a trade deal with Canada because they were backing Palestinian statehood.

“Wow! Canada has just announced that it is backing statehood for Palestine. That will make it very hard for us to make a Trade Deal with them. Oh’ Canada!!!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social.

Canada will recognize a Palestinian state in September, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters on Wednesday.

“Canada intends to recognise the State of Palestine at the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2025,” Carney told reporters.

Canada follows France, which has said it will recognize a Palestinian state in September.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said they will recognize Palestine by September unless Israel agrees to a ceasefire and stop starving Gaza civilians in a genocide.

The earlier Trump tariffs are set to go into effect on August 1. So far, no extensions have been announced.

Trump has said he will impose a higher 35% tariff on Canadian goods.

About three-quarters of Canada’s goods exports go to the United States, according to the Bank of Canada. (Colombo/Jul31/2025)
