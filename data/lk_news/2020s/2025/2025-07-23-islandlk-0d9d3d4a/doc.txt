Dialog Launches Sri Lanka’s Most Affordable 5G Smartphone

Dialog Axiata PLC, Sri Lanka’s #1 connectivity provider, has unveiled the country’s most affordable 5G smartphone, an important step forward in the nation’s digital transformation. Priced at just LKR 35,999, this pioneering initiative is designed to lower the entry barrier to next-generation connectivity by delivering cutting-edge technology at exceptional value.

In collaboration with global technology giant ZTE, Dialog has developed a feature-rich smartphone that brings the power of 5G within reach for more Sri Lankans than ever before. The device was officially launched on 22nd July at the Dialog Iconic Centre, marking a key milestone in Sri Lanka’s journey towards inclusive digital access. Dialog’s state-of-the-art, 5G-ready network is expanding rapidly, with trial transmissions now reaching over 120 sites across the island. The forthcoming launch of commercial 5G services will further accelerate this momentum, paving the way for widespread adoption and unlocking advanced digital capabilities for individuals, businesses, and communities throughout the country.

The Dialog-branded device is powered by a high-performance Unisoc T8300 Octa-Core 2.2GHz processor, delivering seamless multitasking and responsiveness. It features 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, providing ample space and speed for everyday use. A large 6.75-inch HD+ 120Hz waterdrop display enhances visual clarity and fluid scrolling—ideal for immersive video streaming, mobile gaming, and daily productivity. It also includes a dual rear camera system with a 50MP primary lens and 2MP depth sensor, complemented by an 8MP front-facing camera for high-quality video calls and selfies.

Additional features include a side-mounted fingerprint sensor for added security and convenience, a long-lasting 5000mAh battery, and MyOS 1.5—based on Android—for a smooth, customisable experience optimised for everyday use. Whether it’s a student attending online classes, a small business owner managing operations, or a gamer chasing zero-lag performance, this device enables users to experience Sri Lanka’s most advanced 5G-ready network.

To ensure affordability, this smartphone is available with a range of flexible payment options, including Dialog’s Smartphone Plan, Lesi Pay, and Prashansa schemes. Customers can take the device home for just Rs. 7,990 upfront, with monthly instalments starting from as low as Rs. 1,460. All purchases include a one-year ZTE warranty and access to reliable after-sales support. As an added bonus, buyers will enjoy three months of unlimited TikTok data—free of charge—alongside 30GB of Anytime data (10GB per month) for three months.

The Dialog 5G smartphone reflects the company’s commitment to empowering Sri Lankans with transformative technology, ensuring no one is left behind in the digital age. Visit your nearest Dialog Outlet for purchases, or visit https://devices.dialog.lk/ for more information.
