ECONOMYNEXT – The Colombo Stock Exchange indices rose on Wednesday, bucking a falling trend in the last three sessions, data on its site showed.

Market has been on the downward trend for the past three sessions through Tuesday after peaking repeatedly following the finalization of Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring deal in mid December.

“Renewed buying interest is pushing the market up,” Dimantha Mathew, Chief Research & Strategy Officer at First Capital Holdings PLC, told EconomyNext.

“We saw short profit taking in the last three days, but the upward trend will continue” he said referring to the market recovery.
