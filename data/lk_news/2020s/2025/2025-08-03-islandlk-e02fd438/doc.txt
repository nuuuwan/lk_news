Würth Group doubles down on Sri Lanka investment as local arm posts 64% growth

The Würth Group’s recent high-level visit to Sri Lanka underscores its strong commitment to further investment and expansion in the country, reinforcing Würth Lanka’s position as a key regional player.

Würth Lanka achieved remarkable growth in 2024 despite Sri Lanka’s economic downturn and political uncertainty. June 2025 turnover surged by 64% compared to June 2024, demonstrating resilience and strong market demand.

Under Managing Director & CEO Suranga Kekuluwalage since early 2024, the company has embraced agility, efficiency, and a performance-driven culture. The launch of the new ‘Trade’ division has expanded market reach, complementing core divisions like Automotive, Construction, Metal, and Maintenance.

While the Automotive Division remains the largest revenue contributor, other divisions are gaining traction by meeting industry-specific demands. Würth Lanka provides high-quality solutions from fastening systems to safety equipment catering to builders, metalworkers, and maintenance professionals.

Dr. Reiner Specht (Central Managing Board Member) and Christian Olsen (SVP for South & Southeast Asia) emphasized Würth’s confidence in Sri Lanka’s market. The visit signals continued investment in local talent, German-engineered products, and business expansion.

The company’s 25-year legacy in Sri Lanka highlights its role in supporting industrial and trade professionals with reliable solutions. Würth Lanka is poised for further expansion, reinforcing its position as a trusted partner for Sri Lanka’s industrial and automotive sectors.
