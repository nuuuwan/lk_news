CEAT kicks off the next big move in Off Highway mobility

CEAT Limited has made a substantial advancement in its Off-Highway Tyres (OHT) growth strategy by officially acquiring Michelin Group’s

Midigama plant and Casting Product plant in Kotugoda. This transaction also grants CEAT global ownership of the CAMSO brand, which will be permanently assigned across categories after a three-year licensing period.

CEAT’s acquisition of CAMSO brand marks a major milestone in its journey to becoming a leading global player in the high-margin OHT segment. Over the past decade, CEAT has built a strong agricultural portfolio, and with CAMSO’s expertise in compact construction equipment tracks and tyres, the combined strengths open doors to over 40 global OEMs and premium international OHT distributors. Michelin will exit from activities related to compact line bias tyres and construction tracks.

Santosh Jha, High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka, said: “I would like to extend my best wishes to CEAT Limited for its investment in Sri Lanka. India has been the largest source of FDI in Sri Lanka in recent years and I am delighted to see that trend continue. The deepening of the investment-led partnership between the two countries has been catalyzed by the leadership of both countries. It supports their vision of building a future of shared prosperity for our peoples. With India’s private sector investing in Sri Lanka, I’m confident that the economic and commercial relationship between the two countries will continue to strengthen.”
