Former North-Central Province Governor’s hotel removed from tank reservation

A hotel owned by former North-Central Province Governor Maheepala Herath, located on the Peramiyankulama tank reservation, was demolished on the instructions of the Divisional Secretary as part of an ongoing effort to clear encroachments in the Anuradhapura district.

Nuwaragama Palatha Divisional Secretary Sudarashana Disanayake confirmed the action, noting that a notice had been issued on 18 September to Ajantha Herath, the former Governor’s wife, directing the removal of the unauthorised structure.

The Irrigation Department, supported by the Survey Department, is carrying out the Government’s program to demarcate tank reservations in the district and eliminate illegal constructions. Disanayake added that the survey of the Peramiyankulama tank reservation has now been completed.
