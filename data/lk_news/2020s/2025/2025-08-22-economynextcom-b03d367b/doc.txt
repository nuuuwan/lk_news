Sri Lanka ex-President arrives in court

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka ex-President Ranil Wickremesinghe was brought to the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court, after being arrested following a questioning, court reporters said.

He was asked to get into the suspect’s cage, eliciting a loud gasp from people gathered outside.

The arrest was over misappropriation of funds during a foreign visit while he was president, police sources said.

Wickremesinghe became acting president following the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on July 15, 2022.

Days later parliament elected him as the 8th Executive President of the country, during the worst economic crisis of its post-independence history.

He is credited for steering the island nation towards recovery.

He served until Anura Disanayake was elected president on September 21, 2024. (Colombo/Aug22/2025)
