Sri Lanka seeks international offers to revive saltern as PPP

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will seek international offers to review a saltern in northern Jaffna peninsula that went into dis-use during a civil war, minister Nalinda Jayatissa said.

The saltern in Kurunchativu (Elephant Pass north) stopped operations during the civil war that ended in 2009.

“An attempt to revive the saltern with local investors had failed to draw interest, so we are calling for foreign investors,” Jayatissa told reporters.

The cabinet has approved seeking international interest to revive it as a public private partnership. (Colombo/Aug20/2025)
