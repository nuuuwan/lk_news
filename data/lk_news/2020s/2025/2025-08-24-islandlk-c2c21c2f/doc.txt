Pyramid Wilmar launches 20th Anniversary Chefs Programme

Commemorating two decades of operations in Sri Lanka, leading food manufacturing and marketing company Pyramid Wilmar recently announced the launch of a new ‘ChefsHunt’ scholarship programme. The joint venture between Sri Lanka’s Pyramid Oil Mills and Singapore-based agribusiness giant Wilmar International was incorporated in 2005 and has since become a major force in the local industry.

The ‘ChefsHunt’ initiative aims to award 25 culinary enthusiasts across the island with scholarships to enroll in an NVQ Level 4 certification programme at the M W Institute of Culinary Arts. This effort is part of the company’s broader anniversary celebrations and reflects its commitment to nurturing local talent.

Marking the 20-year milestone, Managing Director Sajjad Mawzoon emphasized that the company’s journey “isn’t just about business; it’s about building a better, brighter future for every Sri Lankan.” He reiterated the company’s focus on quality, excellence, innovation, and sustainability to benefit future generations. Director and Chief Operating Officer Thanveer Siddique highlighted the company’s well-integrated supply chain, from plantation to processing and logistics, which has been pivotal in transforming the local food industry.
