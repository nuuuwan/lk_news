Sri Lanka sees US$29mn foreign buying in rupee bonds

ECONOMYNEXT – Foreign investors bought high quantity of Sri Lanka government securities, the Central Bank data showed, as the week ended on August 7 saw better trade arrangements with the United States, calming tariff-related volatility and uncertainty in financial markets.

Foreign investors bought 8,756 million rupee ($29.19 million) worth of government securities in the week ended on August 7, seeing foreign inflow for a second straight week.

Global investors have been waiting for positive news from U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff threats and some of the key deals have calmed tariff-related volatility and uncertainty in financial markets, analysts said.

Sri Lanka suffered an outflow of 10.1 billion rupees in the two weeks soon after Trump’s tariff declaration in the first week of April and the rupee has fallen slightly since then, while global investors have been shifting to safe-havens like gold.

The island nation has, however, enjoyed a total inflow of 39 billion rupees (around $130 million) into rupee bonds since December 26 last year through August 7, the data showed.

Sri Lanka’s deflationary policies have helped to see inflows amid curtailed imports, analysts have said.

The country witnessed foreign outflows worth 48.2 billion rupees in 2024 with 66 percent or 78.1 billion rupees worth outflow from the government securities in the first nine months of last year. (Colombo/August 14 /2025)
