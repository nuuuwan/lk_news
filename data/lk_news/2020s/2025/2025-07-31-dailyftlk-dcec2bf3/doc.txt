The leadership of the Sarvajana Balaya political alliance held a meeting with Palestinian Ambassador Ihab Khalil on Tuesday (29).

This meeting was held to express the deep and unwavering solidarity of the Sri Lankan people with the innocent civilians of Palestine, who continue to endure immense suffering amid a prolonged and inhumane conflict.

Issuing a statement, the political alliance noted that during the discussion, the Sarvajana Balaya conveyed its grave concern over the ongoing humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and the occupied Palestinian territories—the deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure, the widespread displacement of families, and the systematic deprivation of basic necessities resulting in starvation, which all constitute egregious violations of international law.

“We unequivocally condemn these atrocities and call upon Israel to immediately halt all military aggression, lift the illegal siege, and end the collective punishment of an entire population. The international community, especially a nation like Sri Lanka, cannot remain indifferent while innocent lives continue to be lost on a daily basis,” the statement added.

Sarvajana Balaya Leader MP Dilith Jayaweera shared his views on the matter, stating: “We should leave all differences aside and unite to support Palestine against this genocide, while sending a strong message as a nation.”

Guided by the timeless principles of civilisational values, the Sarvajana Balaya reaffirmed its belief that it is the moral duty of all global leaders and nations to stand on the side of peace and humanity.

“At this critical juncture in world history, we call upon international institutions, human rights organisations, and all nations of conscience to act decisively and without delay,” the statement noted.
