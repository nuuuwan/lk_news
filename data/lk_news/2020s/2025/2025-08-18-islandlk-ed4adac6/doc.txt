Love is in the air…

Yes, indeed, it seems certain that love is in the air for versatile musician Roger Menezes who arrived from Australia last Saturday, 16th August.

This is his sixth visit, for this year, to his land of birth.

“Having fulfilled my engagements in Sydney, and bracing the cold weather, I’m happy to be in sunny Lanka,” he said on arrival.

One gets the impression that Roger is in love with Sri Lanka, but it seems that a different kind of love scene is also also on the cards for Roger!

Music-wise, he has numerous performing dates here, starting off with a birthday party, on Thursday (21st), at the Kingsbury Harbour Court, followed by a Friday date (22nd) at Broadway Restaurant, Dehiwela.

Roger will also be seen in action down South – at the Tangerine and Royal Palms, Kalutara.

Kandy Mahaweli Reach, Heritage, and Cinnamon Myst, will also have Roger in their midst.

While in Colombo, he plans to do some charity work for St Nikolaas Home and the School for the Needy, “and I also need to add that I’m negotiating to perform at a new venue in town, on a regular basis, and that’s the reason why I have decided to come on a longer stay.”

The versatile musician will be going back to Sydney to perform for the Christmas party and Carols that will be held by the Bellbirds Club, on the 6th of December, and will be back in Lanka to entertain for the festive season.
