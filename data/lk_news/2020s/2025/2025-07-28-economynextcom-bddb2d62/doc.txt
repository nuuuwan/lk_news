Sri Lanka president in the Maldives to sign bilateral agreements

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka President Anura Dissanayake will sign several agreements while on a 3-day state visit to neighbouring Maldives, he said.

“Just landed in the Maldives! Ready to engage in meaningful discussions with President @MMuizzu and other leaders to strengthen our collaboration. We will also sign several MoUs that will enhance cooperation between Sri Lanka and the Maldives!” Dissanayake said on social media.

Dissanayake landed on the archipelago on Monday commencing his visit at the invitation of the President Mohamed Muizzu.

The visit “will include bilateral discussions between President Dissanayake and President Muizzu, as well as meetings with other senior Maldivian officials” his media division said.

Dissanayake will also address a business forum organised by the Sri Lankan High Commission in the Maldives and engage with members of the Sri Lankan community residing there.

He is accompanied by Minister of Foreign Affairs Vijitha Herath and several government officials on the visit scheduled from July 28 to 30.

Large numbers of Maldivians used to come to Sri Lanka especially for health tourism. But after rules were tightened they could not come, Herath said over the weekend announcing the restoration of a one-year visa facility to Maldivian citizens.

“From August 01, we will give Maldives citizens one year visas,” Herath said in Colombo.

Dissanayake’s visit follows Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the archipelago, where the regional power pledged 565 million dollars to boost infrastructure and support in ‘strengthening its defence capabilities’. (Colombo/Jul28/2025)
