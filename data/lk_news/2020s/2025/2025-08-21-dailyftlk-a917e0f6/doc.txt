Cabinet approves Rs. 86 m renovation of Modara Fisheries cool rooms

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the completion of renovation works on the Modara freezer and cool room facility, one of the largest in South Asia, by utilising funds already allocated to the Fisheries, Aquatic and Ocean Resources Ministry under the 2025 Budget.

Announcing the decision at the weekly post-Cabinet media briefing on Tuesday, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said the renovation project has been estimated at Rs. 86 million.

The Modara facility, owned by the Ceylon Fisheries Corporation, has long been recognised as a strategic national asset for fish storage and preservation. However, Dr. Jayatissa acknowledged that the cool rooms had fallen into disrepair due to weak maintenance and management lapses.

“Plans have now been drawn to renovate and restore two of the cool rooms, with storage capacities of 200 tons and 2.5 tons respectively,” he said.

The proposal to this effect was presented to the Cabinet by Fisheries, Aquatic and Ocean Resources Minister Ramalingam Chandrasekar.
