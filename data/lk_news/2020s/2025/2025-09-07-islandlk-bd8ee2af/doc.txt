Sun Siyam marks 35 years with culture-led brand transformation

Sun Siyam unveils a milestone transformation as it celebrates 35 years of Maldivian hospitality. More than a visual refresh, the brand (re)volution introduces a bold new brand statement anchored in The Home of the Maldivian Spirit, reinforcing the group’s position as one of the Maldives’ most culturally authentic resort operators. The transformation elevates guest journeys with new Signature Experiences introduced across all six resorts and strengthens direct relationships with customers through Siyam Rewards.

A single identity now unites the group’s five Maldivian resorts and its Sri Lankan retreat under The House of Siyam. To help guests and partners navigate the portfolio, each property is now grouped under three distinct collections: Luxury, Privé, and Lifestyle.

Reflecting on this milestone, Ahmed Siyam Mohamed, Founder, Owner & Managing Director, said: “When we founded Sun Siyam in 1990, and later opened our first resort in 1998, our goal was simple, to share the warmth of our islands and our people with the world. This transformation keeps that soul alive while giving us the space to innovate for the next generation of free-spirited travellers.”

Deepak Booneady, Chief Executive Officer, added: “This rebrand is not just about design, it is about experience. It is about cultural authenticity, purpose-driven hospitality, and creating moments that spark joy. With the Maldives’ widest choice of villas, the region’s most generous premium all-inclusive plan, and now our Signature Experiences, we are setting the stage for the future of island travel.”
