Colombo Dockyard delays capital raising needed for Mazagon take-over

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Colombo Dockyard, which is to be taken over by India’s Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited through an injection of capital said the 12.9 billion rupee exercise would be delayed.

“We further wish to inform you that the revised timelines would be notified to you after we receive the requisite regulatory approvals,” Dockyard said in a stock exchange filing without elaborating on the details where approvals are delayed.

Colombo Dockyard is planning to offer 323 million shares at 40 rupees to existing shareholders, and the current controlling shareholder Onomichi of Japan will renounce their entitlement in favour of India’s Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited.

Mazagon said in a filing in India’s National Stock Exchange that it expects to spend up 52.9 million dollars to take control of Colombo Dockyard including a mandatory offer to buyout existing shareholders. (Colombo/Aug29/2025)
