Trinasolar partners Solaris Energy to deliver 25MWp of utility-scale solar across Sri Lanka

Trinasolar, a global leader in smart PV and energy storage solutions, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Solaris Energy Ltd., a leading solar distributor in Sri Lanka, to collaborate on the supply and deployment of 25 megawatt-peak (MWp) of solar modules across the country. The agreement was formalised at SNEC 2025 in Shanghai, the world’s largest solar industry exhibition.

The strategic partnership reflects Trinasolar’s growing commitment to the South Asian market, while providing invaluable support for Sri Lanka’s national goal of accelerating the shift toward clean and sustainable energy. Under the MoU, Solaris Energy will nominate Trinasolar as one of its subcontractors for utility-scale solar projects in Sri Lanka, subject to definitive agreements.

“This partnership with Solaris Energy marks an important milestone in our long-term commitment to Sri Lanka’s renewable energy journey,” said Trinasolar Asia Pacific Group Director for South, Southeast and Central Asia Elva Wang. “By combining our industry-leading Vertex N modules with Solaris’s strong local presence, we are enabling the delivery of reliable, high-efficiency solar infrastructure that supports the country’s clean energy goals. We look forward to accelerating sustainable growth and empowering Sri Lanka with world-class PV technology.”

At the core of this collaboration is Trinasolar’s Vertex N series, featuring n-type i-TOPCon cell technology. These modules are engineered for high efficiency, superior temperature performance, and low Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE). With their high bifaciality and advanced durability, Vertex N modules are especially suited for Sri Lanka’s tropical climate and national grid requirements.

“We are excited to collaborate with Trinasolar, a global technology leader, to bring advanced solar solutions to utility-scale projects across Sri Lanka,” said Solaris Energy, Solaris Energy Ltd. CEO T. Thiriyambagan. “This MoU represents a powerful step forward in delivering future-ready infrastructure that strengthens Sri Lanka’s energy resilience. By integrating proven global innovation with deep local expertise, we aim to empower Sri Lanka’s transition to a low-carbon future.”

The MoU was signed in Shanghai and witnessed by Trinasolar Asia Pacific President Todd Li alongside Solaris Energy CEO T. Thiriyambagan.

This agreement builds on Trinasolar’s strong global momentum, as the company continues to expand access to its advanced solar technologies across Asia Pacific. By working with trusted local partners like Solaris, Trinasolar aims to play a key role in shaping Sri Lanka’s renewable energy future. Trinasolar’s commitment to innovation and sustainability is reflected in its consistent recognition as a top performer in the solar industry, ensuring reliable and high-efficiency solar solutions for the region.
