Spa Ceylon in forefront of helping to manage Human-Elephant Conflict

Sri Lanka’s elephants are among its most powerful symbols of heritage and natural wealth. They are also one of the island’s most valuable economic assets, contributing directly and indirectly to tourism and rural livelihoods. Yet, the escalating Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC) continues to extract a devastating toll on both people and elephants, underlining the urgent need for sustainable solutions.

In a bid to draw fresh attention to this issue, Spa Ceylon, together with its conservation arm Ceylon Elephant Co. and in collaboration with the Wildlife & Nature Protection Society (WNPS), launched the Majestic Ceylon Elephant Photography Competition and Exhibition. The four-day event, which commenced on September 8 and runs until September 11 at Havelock City Mall, highlights both the beauty of the island’s elephants and the reality of their survival amid conflict.

At the inauguration, Spa Ceylon Co-Founder and Group Director, Shalin Balasuriya, positioned the initiative as a deeper commitment to conservation beyond traditional corporate social responsibility.

He added: “At Spa Ceylon, we believe conservation is not the responsibility of a few, but a shared duty of all. We are deeply committed to the conservation of the Ceylon Elephant, while raising awareness on the human-elephant conflict and finding ways to move forward with initiatives that bring communities together.”

Balasuriya noted that Spa Ceylon’s conservation initiatives stem from its long association with art, culture and sustainability. “This exhibition is another way we want the country to understand the influence and progress of our conservation work. It reflects our role as not just a business, but as a partner in driving long-term social and environmental change, he added.

Jehan CanagaRetna, Past President of WNPS and chair of its Elephant Coexistence Subcommittee, stressed the dual reality of elephants as both an economic powerhouse and a source of conflict.

He added: “More than 700 people have lost their lives to HEC in the past 20 years. At the same time, elephants contribute enormously to our tourism industry, with their value in the national tourism value chain exceeding Rs. 20 million. This dual reality must be recognised—elephants are an irreplaceable part of our biodiversity and economy, but the cost of conflict is devastating, he stressed.

Despite this, HEC remains poorly addressed at the policy level. CanagaRetna reminded the audience that Sri Lanka has had a National Action Plan on HEC for nearly two decades, presented to successive governments but never fully adopted. “There is no single solution—it requires a top-down policy commitment from government, combined with grassroots community engagement, he said.

He also stressed that protecting elephants cannot be separated from protecting the rural farming communities who bear the brunt of HEC.

“The way forward is to ensure that communities gain something positive from coexisting with elephants, CanagaRetna explained. “If farmers see benefits—whether through improved livelihoods, scholarships for children of HEC victims, or tourism-linked initiatives—they are more likely to adopt practices that support coexistence.”

One such initiative, supported by Spa Ceylon and WNPS, is an educational scholarship programme for children who have lost a parent in HEC incidents. This ongoing programme ensures affected children can continue their schooling, reducing the long-term socio-economic fallout of the conflict.

Representing the business sector, Ghazanfar Ali, COO of Havelock City Mall, stressed that conservation-linked initiatives must evolve beyond symbolic CSR exercises.

“This is not just CSR—it is about building sustainable partnerships that reach out to communities at large. Businesses must see conservation as a responsibility tied to their operations and customers, not as a side project, he said.
