Sri Lanka underutilized land to be offered to investors: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Underutilized lands and properties belonging to Sri Lanka’s state institutions will be offered to investors for various projects, Minister Nalinda Jayatissa said.

“Investors, including small and medium scale entrepreneurs, can use them for economically productive projects,” he told reporters.

The cabinet had approved a proposal to offer underutilized lands held by the Land Reforms Commission, Regional Plantation Companies, National Livestock Development Board, Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation and Janatha Estate Development Board and provide them for private investment, he said.

However, Regional Plantation Companies have already been leased out to private investors, and it is not clear how they will be taken back. Two RPCs remain in government control.

Jayatissa said tenders will be called for the ‘underutilized’ lands for projects that include plantation/agricultural activities, plantation-related tourism promotion activities, livestock development, hydropower generation, solar energy generation, factory-related manufacturing activities, freshwater fisheries and other plantation-related economic innovation activities.
