Sri Lanka central bank to review SRR framework

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank is reviewing the current statutory reserve requirements of banks, Governor Nandalal Weeerasinghe said delivering the agency’s annual plans for the year.

The central bank is reviewing the SRR in line with international best practices, he said.

“Required changes will be implemented following stakeholder consultations to optimise the SRR framework for the benefit of effective monetary policy implementation and the overall financial system,” according to the published text of the speech.

Many floating rate central banks no longer have large reserve requirements, and do not use them to tighten or loosen policy.

The Fed in the run up to triggering the latest inflation bubble, dropped the concept of required reserves altogether.

It could then print money without the limits of ‘excess reserves or excess liquidity’, critics say.

When pegged central banks created external instability and high inflation with open market operations in the last century, statutory ratios were raised to double digits, especially in Latin America.

Some central banks also used to impose different reserve ratios on different types of deposits.

The International Monetary Fund is pushing for reserve requirement for dollar deposits, as part of its ‘de-dollarization’ agenda despite.

However, the central bank cannot print dollars and create monetary instability.  (Colombo/Jan08/2024)
