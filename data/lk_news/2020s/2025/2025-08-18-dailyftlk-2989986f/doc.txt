Sri Lanka is set to take centre stage once again as Voyage Sri Lanka 2025—the nation’s flagship international marine summit returns on 16 October at The Kingsbury Hotel, Colombo.

Building on the resounding success of its inaugural edition in 2024, which drew 240 participants from eight countries and featured 24 global speakers, this year’s summit sets even higher ambitions: 300+ attendees, 12+ participating nations, and a sharper focus on turning Sri Lanka’s blue economy potential into tangible outcomes.

Organised by the EDB, the event will bring together Government policymakers, industry leaders, global investors, academia, and innovators, all aligned under one mission: Unveiling the Blue Economy Potential of Sri Lanka.

This year’s keynote address, delivered by a distinguished Sri Lankan expert, will set the tone for a day of insight and action focused directly on the nation’s marine future.

Three high-impact panel discussions will explore the most pressing opportunities for Sri Lanka’s marine economy:

1. Trincomalee as the Strategic Gateway to Sri Lanka’s Blue Economy

2. Energising Sri Lanka’s Blue Economy: Offshore Oil & Gas Exploration and LNG Infrastructure as Economic Game Changers

3. Charting a Course for Growth: Synergising Boat Building and Nautical Tourism for Sri Lanka’s Blue Economy

Complementing these discussions will be boat displays showcasing the craftsmanship and innovation of Sri Lanka’s world-class boatbuilding industry, as well as networking sessions designed to connect stakeholders through business-to-business (B2B) meetings, investor roundtables, and targeted matchmaking opportunities.

Sri Lanka, positioned at the heart of the Indian Ocean, holds a unique advantage in the emerging blue economy. Voyage Sri Lanka 2025 will act as a global platform to:

Forge partnerships across the Indian Ocean region to drive sustainable economic growth.
