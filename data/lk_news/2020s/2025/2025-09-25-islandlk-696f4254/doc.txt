HUTCH, the only telecom brand to triumph at SLIM Premier Digital Awards

HUTCH Sri Lanka reaffirmed its leadership in digital engagement by winning six awards at SLIM Digis 2.5, making it one of the most awarded brands at this year’s digital excellence forum. This achievement is especially meaningful as HUTCH stood out as the only telecom operator to receive an accolade.

Organized by the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM), SLIM Digis is the country’s most renowned platform for recognising innovation and digital excellence. HUTCH’s recognition reflects its ability to combine creativity with measurable results, staying deeply connected to the everyday needs of its customers while setting high benchmarks in the industry. Evidently, HUTCH is staying ahead in the evolving digital landscape, guided by data-driven decision-making and fueled by novel creativity. The honours reaffirm that those approaches are not just relevant but impactful.

In the category of Best Use of Digital in the Telecommunication Sector, HUTCH proudly won for its “There’s Always an Option” campaign, which has come to define its renewed brand journey. HUTCH was also awarded for the pioneering 2X product, which combines home broadband and mobile data into a single plan, and for “Ratatama HUTCH,” an agile campaign during the election period that connected with the audience through culturally relevant storytelling. Under Best Performance Marketing, HUTCH was recognized for its eSIM services, which redefine connectivity without physical SIMs, and for its Roaming campaign, which was praised for improving overseas connectivity via data-driven optimization.
