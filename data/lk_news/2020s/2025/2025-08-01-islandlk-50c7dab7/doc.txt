Dialog MAS Enabler Programme champions workplace inclusion for persons with disabilities

Dialog Axiata PLC, Sri Lanka’s #1 connectivity provider, together with MAS Holdings, an apparel manufacturing and technology conglomerate, have successfully concluded the third consecutive Dialog MAS Enabler Programme, reaffirming their shared commitment to workplace inclusivity and the empowerment of persons with disabilities through targeted exposure to real-world corporate, manufacturing, and service environments.

Held from 23rd June to 7th July 2025, the two-week programme enabled selected undergraduates and young professionals with disabilities to spend time at Dialog and MAS. Participants engaged across corporate offices, customer-facing service centres, and manufacturing facilities, receiving guided briefings on corporate culture and gaining hands-on exposure to the operations of both organisations.

The sessions combined theoretical learning and practical experiences, covering workplace etiquette, the hiring process, interview preparation, career development, and department-specific forums led by industry experts. In addition to technical and operational insights, participants also developed vital soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and leadership—key competencies that support long-term professional growth and integration into dynamic work environments.

As a progression from last year’s initiative, Dialog introduced a pilot pre-employment training programme at its call centre to equip persons with disabilities for potential career opportunities. Additionally, the Inclusive Champions Programme was launched to foster internal awareness and advocacy for disability inclusion across the organisation.

“This programme is a step towards integrating persons with disabilities into real work environments where they gain insight into workplace culture, day-to-day operations, and the expectations of a professional setting. It helps bridge the gap between academic learning and practical experience, giving participants clarity on the skills and opportunities they may want to pursue to shape and build their careers. We’re proud to partner in an initiative that takes inclusion from policy to action.” stated Nemanthie Kooragamage, Director – Group Sustainable Business at MAS Holdings.

“The Dialog MAS Enabler Programme reflects our purpose-driven approach to inclusion—offering exposure, mentorship, and practical experiences that prepare persons with disabilities for meaningful careers.” said Asanga Priyadarshana, Group Chief Corporate Officer at Dialog Axiata PLC.
