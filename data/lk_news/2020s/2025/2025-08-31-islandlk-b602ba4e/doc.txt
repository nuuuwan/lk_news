Sanasa General Insurance goes live on Oracle Cloud

Sanasa General Insurance Company (SGIC) has successfully completed a significant digital transformation by migrating its core insurance application and integration services to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). This strategic initiative was executed with the support of DMS Software Technologies, a premier Oracle partner in Sri Lanka, and was celebrated at an event at SGIC’s Colombo headquarters.

DMS led the migration process, leveraging its expertise in cloud readiness and change management to ensure a smooth transition with minimal operational disruption. This move is a key part of SGIC’s broader digital roadmap to enhance its competitiveness and responsiveness in the insurance sector.

The adoption of OCI provides SGIC with improved scalability, performance, and security, creating a foundation for future innovation.

This transformation establishes a modernization benchmark for other financial institutions in Sri Lanka and underscores the critical role of digital infrastructure in driving sector growth.
