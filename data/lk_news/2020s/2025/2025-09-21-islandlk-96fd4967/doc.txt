Brandix crowned Sri Lanka’s leading corporate blood donor for 13th consecutive year

Brandix, Sri Lanka’s premier apparel exporter, has once again been recognized as the country’s Largest Corporate Blood Donor, a title it has now held for an unprecedented 13 consecutive years. The award was presented by Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya at the World Blood Donor Day celebrations, honouring the group’s 16th Annual Group Blood Drive.

The scale of Brandix’s contribution is transformative. Since the inception of its annual blood drive, Brandix has donated a total of 47,655 pints of blood, directly benefiting over 142,965 patients across the country with the ‘gift of life’. In 2024 alone, the group added 2,371 pints to the National Blood Bank, reinforcing its vital partnership with the National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS).

This achievement underscores a remarkable level of associate participation. With one in every 100 blood donors in Sri Lanka being a member of the Brandix community.
