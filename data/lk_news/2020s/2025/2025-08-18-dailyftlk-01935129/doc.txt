Frostaire celebrates 45 years of excellence in air conditioning solutions

Frostaire recently marked a significant milestone by celebrating 45 years of dedicated services, innovation, and leadership in Sri Lanka’s air conditioning industry.

Founded on 18 August 1980, Frostaire began as a modest service operation and has grown into one of Sri Lanka’s most respected names in air conditioning solutions, with a reputation built on trust, technical expertise, and customer satisfaction. The company has consistently delivered cutting-edge products and reliable after-sales services across residential, commercial, and industrial sectors islandwide.

“Celebrating 45 years is more than a number—it reflects our commitment to excellence, our loyal customers, and the hard-working team behind Frostaire,” said Frostaire Managing Director Mukthar Marikkar. “We have grown with our client and adapted to the changing landscape with energy-efficient, eco-friendly, and smart air conditioning systems.”

Over the past four and a half decades, Frostaire has successfully installed and maintained thousands of air conditioning systems across the country.

The company has built strategic partnerships with leading global HVAC brands, introduced green cooling technologies and R32/R410 refrigerant-based solutions, and trained and developed a strong network of certified service technologies.

As part of the anniversary celebration, Frostaire is launching a ‘45 Years of Comfort’ campaign, which includes a special service discount and an extended warranty offer for loyal customers.

“Looking ahead, we are committed to expanding our service teams to meet the growing needs of our customers and to continue delivering industry-leading support and satisfaction,” the company statement added.
