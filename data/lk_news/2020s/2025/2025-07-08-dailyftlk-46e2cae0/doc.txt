Fashion visionary Prassanna Pathmanathan honoured on global stage

In a moment of well-earned global recognition, Prassanna Pathmanathan, one of Sri Lanka’s foremost names in fashion and pageantry, was awarded the ‘Creative Visionary in Fashion and Pageantry’ title at the Passion Vista Glamour and Style Awards and Global Leadership Forum held recently at Waters Edge Hotel.

Hosted by Passion Vista, a globally renowned luxury, lifestyle, and business magazine published by Unified Brainz Media and Publication House, the annual awards ceremony celebrates pioneers and influencers across fashion capitals. This year’s event, held in Sri Lanka, brought together top-tier global fashion professionals and pageant leaders—and placed a spotlight squarely on one of Sri Lanka’s finest exports.

As Colombo Fashion Council Founder and President, Pathmanathan has redefined the boundaries of fashion in Sri Lanka. What sets him apart is not just his deep-rooted passion for fashion, but a unique foundation in IT, business, and marketing—a blend that has positioned him as a thought leader in a rapidly evolving industry.

With an impressive academic track record, including a Gold Medal from the University of Westminster (UK), a Chartered Marketer status, and an MBA from the University of Wales, Pathmanathan has consistently balanced intellect with creativity. But his résumé doesn’t stop at academia. He is also an international corporate trainer, lecturer, marketing consultant, and researcher, making him a multifaceted figure in both the business and fashion spheres.

His journey in fashion took global momentum when he became the first Asian judge at the Mr. Earth Worldwide Pageant in 2011. Since then, he has served on numerous international pageant panels, trained aspiring models across continents, and curated fashion shows with a creative flair that has made him one of the most sought-after names in the region.

Among his standout accolades is the British Council’s ‘Young Creative Entrepreneur Fashion and Design Award,’ which he clinched in 2022 out of 230 local contenders. This win granted him a coveted fashion study tour in London, catalysing cross-border collaborations and giving him access to some of the industry’s biggest minds.

His contribution doesn’t end on the runway. Pathmanathan lectures on fashion branding, marketing, and sustainability, and is the only Sri Lankan to be invited as a Guest Speaker at India’s prestigious National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) in both Mumbai and Delhi.

This recent award adds yet another feather in his already heavily adorned cap and signals Sri Lanka’s rising influence in global fashion circles. With each accolade, Prassanna Pathmanathan not only elevates his personal brand but also paves the way for Sri Lankan talent to shine internationally.
