Denipitiya Medical Mission is situated in the Southern Province, and nearly 1000 patients are treated each month.

Since the buildings are in a dilapidated status, roadway needs to be constructed, and the dental clinic to be restored to give a service to the school children of the neighbouring schools, Sing-Along 2025 is to raise funds for that purpose.
