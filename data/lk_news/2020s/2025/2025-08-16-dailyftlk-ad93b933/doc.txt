7th Fleet’s USS Santa Barbara in maiden call to Colombo

The US Embassy in Sri Lanka in a statement on Friday said the USS Santa Barbara of the 7th Fleet will make its first call on the Port of Colombo on 16 August.

It said the US 7th Fleet commands the world’s largest forward-deployed fleet with the primary mission of providing operational control and planning for its forces in the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans, while promoting regional stability and maritime security through engagements with allies and partners.

“The first visit of the Independence-variant littoral combat ship to Colombo underscored the strength of the US-Sri Lanka partnership and shared commitment to a secure, prosperous, and free Indo-Pacific. “It also reflects the longstanding ties between our navies and the close cooperation that defines our relationship. Colombo will serve as a brief stop for the ship to take on fuel and supplies before continuing its mission,” the embassy said.

US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung said: “The arrival of the USS Santa Barbara to Sri Lanka is a powerful symbol of the US-Sri Lanka partnership in action. As part of the US 7th Fleet, the Navy’s largest forward-deployed fleet, this visit reflects our shared commitment to maritime security, regional stability, and a free and open Indo-Pacific. We’re proud to stand alongside Sri Lanka as we work together to promote peace and prosperity across the region.”

The USS Santa Barbara is an Independence-variant Littoral Combat Ship designed to operate in near-shore environments and support forward presence, maritime security, sea control, and deterrence missions. Christened on 16 October, 2021, it is currently operating as part of Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) 7. The Santa Barbara conducts regular Indo-Pacific patrols to deter aggression, strengthen alliances and partnerships, and advance future war-fighting capabilities.
