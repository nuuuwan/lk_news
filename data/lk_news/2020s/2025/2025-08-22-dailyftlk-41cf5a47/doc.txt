CIPM Sri Lanka, the nation’s leader in Human Resource Management, has achieved a landmark accomplishment by earning the ISO 21001:2018 Educational Organisation Management System (EOMS) certification from the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) – an honour that cements its position at the forefront of educational excellence.

The certification was ceremoniously presented to CIPM Sri Lanka President Priyantha Ranasinghe by Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) Director General Dr. Siddhika G. Senaratne. The presentation took place at the CIPM Diploma Awarding Ceremony held at BMICH, in the presence of an esteemed gathering of distinguished guests, Council Members, faculty, students, and staff.

“This recognition is a testament to our relentless pursuit of quality and innovation in HR education,” said Ranasinghe, who spearheaded the ISO 21001:2018 compliance and certification initiative. “It affirms that CIPM not only meets but exceeds internationally accepted standards in every facet of our educational delivery.”

The ISO 21001:2018 standard, established by the International Organisation for Standardisation, is the world’s first management system designed specifically for educational institutions. It emphasises learner satisfaction, ethical leadership, accessibility, equity, evidence-based decision-making, and continuous improvement. Institutions adopting this framework demonstrate an ability to align academic programs with the needs of students, employers, and society while ensuring accountability and operational excellence.

CIPM’s certification follows a rigorous audit by SLSI, covering both academic and administrative systems at its Head Office and all regional centres. It confirms that CIPM operates with consistency, transparency, and a learner-focused approach across its entire network.

As the higher education sector faces growing demands for credibility and measurable quality, this achievement sets CIPM apart as an institution that not only meets global benchmarks but also raises them. By embedding internationally recognised best practices into its operations, CIPM strengthens its role in shaping the next generation of HR professionals and advancing the future of work in Sri Lanka and beyond.
