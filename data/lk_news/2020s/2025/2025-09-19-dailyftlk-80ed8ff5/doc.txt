Suspects arrested over killing of activist Dan Priyasad

Police have arrested the alleged gunman linked to the fatal shooting of activist Dan Priyasad, along with two others.

The arrests were made at a rented house in Ranwala, where officers also recovered 12,400 sticks of cigarettes, five elephant pearls, and quantities of narcotics.

Priyasad, who led the “Nawa Sinhale National Movement,” was shot dead at the Laksanda Sevana Housing Complex in Wellampitiya on 22 April.

The suspects, aged between 39 and 55, are from Kegalle and Welioya. Investigators said one of them, believed to be a former soldier who had not been legally discharged, is suspected of carrying out the killing and of involvement in a separate shooting attempt in Mahabage last year.
