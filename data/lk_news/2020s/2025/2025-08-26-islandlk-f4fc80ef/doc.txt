Bert … in the spotlight

Bert Ekenaike is making his presence felt in Melbourne, Australia, in a very big way, but not as an entertainer.

He is big in the scene over there as a promoter in the entertainment industry, and his activities have benefitted several Sri Lankan performers.

As President of The Voluntary Outreach Club, last month (July), on the 19th, Bert provided an excellent ‘Winter Ball’, at The Grand On Princess, Mulgrave, Melbourne.

According to informed sources, tickets were priced at $100 that allowed people, especially the pensioners and unemployed, to enjoy the music of Sri Lanka’s premier band Redeemers, with Perfect Harmony as a second band.

Bert is now working on ‘A Flaming Night’, presented by the PPA of his old school, St. John’s College, Nugegoda, to be held on 13th September, at Number Ninety Receptions, with the band Flame, from Sri Lanka, providing the music.

It’s after six years, says Bert, that Flame will be seen in action, at an event in Melbourne

Next will be the much looked forwarded to Country Night dinner dance to be held at the Grand on Princess, Mulgrave, on 26th October.

And he plans to wind up 2025 with his customary New Year’s Eve dance at the Grand On Princess, Mulgrave, with Replay 6, and Ebony, with special guests from Sri Lanka Clifford Richards and Radika Rajavelu.
