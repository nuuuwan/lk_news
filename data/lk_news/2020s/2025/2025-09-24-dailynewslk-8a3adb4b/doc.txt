SLT Mobitel Group made profit making venture in first half of 2025 – Acting Minister

The National People’s Power (NPP) Government has made Sri Lanka Telecom and Mobitel from loss making companies into profit making state telecommunication companies within the first six months of 2025, Acting Digital Economy Minister Eranga Weeraratne told Parliament yesterday (23).

The Acting Minister said that SLT became a loss making company by 2023 due to weaknesses in the management which caused it to lose its customer base and become second to another competitor telecommunication company which was incorporated only 32 years ago as telecommunication is a highly competitive industry in Sri Lanka.

Responding to a question raised by ruling party MP Sunil Rathnasiri, the Acting Minister said that the new NPP government has taken steps to make SLT into a profit making state telecommunication company by making changes and appointing a new management for both SLT and Mobitel with an experienced Chairman with over 40 years’ experience in the telecommunication industry.

The Acting Digital Economy Minister gave examples of how the new NPP government has turned SLT Mobitel into a profit making group.

“In the first six months of 2024, Mobitel made a loss of Rs.1.1 billion and in contrast, within the first six months of 2025, Mobitel has made Rs.1.1 billion profit.

Also, the SLT Mobitel as a group made a loss of Rs.323 million in the first six months of 2024 which has turned into a massive profit of Rs.4,276 million.

The revenue of SLT Mobitel Group has been increased to Rs.1.6 billion as a result of the changes made by the new government in the management within the first six months of 2025 and its operating cost has been reduced by Rs. 1.1 billion.”

“The debt of SLT Mobitel Group has been reduced by Rs.13 billion by also reducing the capital expenditure and through the profit earned and through these measures taken, the government has made SLT/Mobitel into a profit making state telecommunication group”, the Acting Digital Economy Minister said.
