Vehicle roadworthiness vital to reduce accidents: Sajeev Rajaputhra

Colombo, September 26 (Daily Mirror) - In the wake of the recent bus tragedy in Ella and a spate of road accidents across the country, SAS3 Trading Company has urged the government to implement a comprehensive vehicle roadworthiness project to ensure safety standards in Sri Lanka’s transport sector.

Addressing the media, SAS3 Trading CEO Sajeev in Japan, Rajaputhra said that road safety is determined not only by driver behavior but also by the mechanical condition of vehicles. He said a national roadworthiness program involving regular inspections, strict enforcement of maintenance standards, and the removal of unfit vehicles from the roads was essential to reducing preventable tragedies.

Rajaputhra revealed that he had been discussing the proposal with successive governments since 2017 but claimed political reasons had stalled its implementation. “None of the ministers rejected the project. All agreed it is very much needed for the country,” he said.

Citing data, he said that nearly 26,000 people had died in accidents linked to vehicle technical failures over the past seven years an average of nine deaths a day. He highlighted that mandatory roadworthiness testing was vital for Sri Lanka, where vehicles are sold at some of the highest prices in the world.

"Sri Lanka has become a country where vehicles are among the most expensive assets a citizen can own, yet there is no structured system to maintain, protect, or certify the mechanical safety of that asset," Rajaputhra said.

He also warned that the lack of a national system to monitor vehicle condition places a heavy burden on the public health sector, which must absorb the cost of treating accident-related injuries.

According to SAS3 Trading research, roadworthiness testing is not only about saving lives but also conserving national resources. Rajaputhra pointed out that proper tire maintenance alone could reduce annual fuel consumption by 3%, saving around USD 150 million in fuel imports. A fully maintained vehicle fleet, he added, could push the savings up to 7% through fewer breakdowns, reduced emergency repairs, and extended vehicle lifespan.

Rajaputhra also criticized the existing vehicle emission testing program, saying it only measures environmental output and does not ensure road safety.

He pledged to implement the roadworthiness project within three months of government approval, using Japanese technology and machinery under a USD 100 million foreign direct investment plan. Testing centers, he proposed, could be set up on underutilized Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) land under a profit-sharing model to benefit both the state and the public.

“This project is no longer a matter of technical progress it is a matter of national conscience,” Rajaputhra said. “We have the system, the technology, and the foreign investment. All we need is the will to act. If not, based on current fatality rates, another 16,425 lives could be lost during this five-year term.”
