IIHS launches new 1+2 pathway with Australia’s Deakin University

The International Institute of Health Sciences (IIHS) has launched a new 1+2 academic pathway in partnership with Deakin University, Australia. This initiative provides Sri Lankan students with a streamlined route to an international degree.

Under this pathway, students complete a one-year Diploma of Health Science at IIHS in Sri Lanka before transferring to Deakin University for the final two years of their bachelor’s degree. This model offers a cost-effective start with local academic support and a seamless transition to global education.

The program grants entry into several internationally recognized Deakin degrees: : Bachelor of Exercise and Sport Science, Bachelor of Nutrition Science and Bachelor of Psychological Science A key benefit for students is eligibility for Post-Study Work Rights in Australia, enabling them to gain valuable international work experience.

This partnership reinforces IIHS’s role as a gateway to international healthcare education, equipping Sri Lankan students with the qualifications to thrive in global healthcare, science, and wellness industries. For more information, contact info@iihs.edu.lk |
