Govt. assures  continuity of Pekoe Trail despite Founder’s exit

Tourism Minister Vijitha Herath yesterday reaffirmed that the Government remains fully committed to the continuation of the Pekoe Trail project, despite the exit of its Founder Miguel Cunat.

Responding to questions raised at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing, Herath stressed that the project is not dependent on any individual. “The Pekoe Trail will continue irrespective of personal resignations. The Government is committed to ensuring its success,” he said.

Cunat, a sustainable tourism pioneer and long-time resident of Sri Lanka, dedicated more than a decade to exploring and mapping Sri Lanka’s central highlands in order to create the country’s first long-distance hiking route. His work was supported by a three-year program funded by the EU and United States Agency for International Development (USAID), aimed at promoting sustainable and community-based tourism.

Spanning over 300 kilometres, the trail meanders through Sri Lanka’s tea country, offering hikers access to remote villages, cultural landmarks, and diverse landscapes in the hill country.

The Pekoe Trail has already gained significant international recognition. In November 2023, it received the British Guild of Travel Writers (BGTW) International Tourism Award for “Best Wider World Tourism Project”—the first time Sri Lanka has ever won this accolade. The following year, it was featured on National Geographic’s “Best of the World” list for 2024, further boosting its profile as a flagship tourism experience.

“The Pekoe Trail represents a new dimension in our tourism portfolio, connecting local communities with global travellers. Its continuation is assured,” Herath added.
