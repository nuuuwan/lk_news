New era for island of gems as countdown begins to ‘FACETS Sri Lanka 2026’

Three months and counting until ‘FACETS Sri Lanka 2026’ opens its doors

Only three months remain until the grand opening of FACETS Sri Lanka 2026 – the 33rd edition of Asia’s premier gem and jewellery exhibition, organised by the Sri Lanka Gem and Jewellery Association (SLJGA) in collaboration with the National Jewellery Authority.

The event will take place from 3 to 5 January 2026 at Cinnamon Life City of Dreams. This landmark edition of the exhibition is set to introduce a futuristic two-floor showcase that celebrates the country’s unparalleled gem legacy and vibrant jewellery sector and reaffirms Sri Lanka’s reputation as the true ‘Island of Gems.’

A major highlight leading up to the exhibition is the announcement of the Sapphire Sponsorship Circle, which is a distinguished group of 11 of Sri Lanka’s foremost gem exporters and jewellers. The circle includes Colombo Jewellery Stores, Domico Gems, Ellawala Exports Ltd., Gem Paradise, Mushan International, Regal Gems, RnR Fine Gems, Ruwanpura Gems Ltd., Subash Gems, Trust Gems, and Zam Gems. Their collective demonstrates unity amongst the industry and its commitment to elevating FACETS as the country’s leading international platform for gems and jewellery.

SLGJA President Akram Cassim said: “The Sapphire Sponsorship Circle reflects the unity and strength of our industry, with some of Sri Lanka’s foremost gem exporters and jewellers coming together to elevate FACETS 2026. Their support is a powerful endorsement of our shared vision to showcase the brilliance of Sri Lankan gemstones and craftsmanship on a global stage. FACETS has always been more than just an exhibition; it is a celebration of our heritage, a driver of innovation, and a platform to connect Sri Lanka with the world.”

FACETS 2026 Chairman Armil Sammoon said: “FACETS has proudly carried the story of Sri Lanka’s gems to the world for over three decades. Since its inception in 1991, the exhibition has grown into an internationally respected platform that highlights the richness of our sapphire legacy and the incredible variety of over 50 gemstones found in our island. Each edition has not only promoted our exports but also strengthened Sri Lanka’s reputation as the true ‘Island of Gems.’ FACETS 2026 will build on this history with a bold, futuristic vision that connects our past to the opportunities of tomorrow.”

FACETS 2026 also announced that Universal Travel Bureau (UTB) has signed up as its Official Travel Partner. As part of this, UTB will curate customised pre-show and post-show experiences for delegates, which will allow to experience and connect with Sri Lanka at a deeper level. These offerings will include exclusive gem mine tours, which will provide visitors with a rare insight into mining traditions that have spanned centuries, and the sustainable practices that continue to define the gem industry. Through this collaboration, FACETS 2026 goes beyond being just a trade show, transforming into a cultural gateway that blends heritage, hospitality, and discovery.

The SLGJA said the relocation of FACETS to Cinnamon Life City of Dreams also marks a bold new chapter for the exhibition. This will be the first time that the exhibition will span two dedicated floors, with an immersive layout that combines tradition and innovation. Visitors will have the opportunity to explore a plethora of interactive displays that detail the gem journey from mine to market. Story Corners, where exhibitors share their brand stories, and VR showcases, offering insights into Sri Lanka’s gemstone origins, will also be featured.

FACET Sri Lanka 2026 will also spotlight sustainability, ethical sourcing, and cutting-edge design to ensure that the exhibition not only celebrates Sri Lanka’s 2,500-year gem heritage, but also aligns with future global trade and consumer expectations. Over its 30-year history, FACETS has evolved into one of the most anticipated and respected exhibitions in the international gem and jewellery calendar. The country itself is synonymous with sapphires ranging from the celebrated cornflower blue to the rare padparadscha and modern teal. Sri Lanka’s gems have long adorned the world’s most prestigious collections.

This edition of FACETS seeks to honour and celebrate this legacy, while also reimagining the future, drawing global buyers, traders, and enthusiasts to Colombo for a truly memorable showcase. Backed by the Sapphire Sponsorship Circle and further strengthened by its partnership with UTC, FACETS Sri Lanka 2026 is set to be its most dynamic edition to date, the SLGJA added.
