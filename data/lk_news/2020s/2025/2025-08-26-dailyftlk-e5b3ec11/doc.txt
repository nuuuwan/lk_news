President’s Fund to expand assistance for differently-abled persons

The President’s Fund will expand assistance programs for differently-abled persons, the Presidential Secretariat said last Friday.

A discussion was held last week at the Presidential Secretariat between Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake and National Secretariat for Persons with Disabilities officials to establish a more structured mechanism for providing assistance to the disabled community.

The meeting focused on expanding and systematising the services provided through the President’s Fund for persons with disabilities, as well as the execution of programs in partnership with the National Secretariat for Persons with Disabilities. Key areas of attention included increasing support allowances, providing essential equipment to empower differently-abled persons, supporting the continuous education of their children, and offering special educational assistance to differently-abled children.

The discussion was also attended by Senior Additional Secretary to the President and Secretary to the President’s Fund Roshan Gamage, National Secretariat for Persons with Disabilities Director Jayamali C. Wickramarachchi, and President’s Fund officials.
