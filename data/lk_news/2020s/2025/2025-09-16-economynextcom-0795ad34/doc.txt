Sri Lanka Cabinet approves action to enable expatriates to vote in elections

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka Cabinet has granted its approval for relevant ministries and authorities to enact laws enabling the island nation’s expatriates to vote in elections from offshore, Cabinet Spokesman and Media Minister Nalinda Jayatissa said.

At the moment, the election laws only allow the citizens living within Sri Lanka and registered their names in the electoral to vote in any election.

“According to the current elections law there is no provision to secure any method to cast votes for the citizens offshores or no law has been formulated in this regard,” Minister Jayatissa told reporters at the weekly post-Cabinet media briefing.

“However, many Asian countries such as India, Bangladesh, Philippines have formulated legal strategies to enable their citizens offshore to cast votes and it has been recognized as a timely requirement to amend such types of laws for Sri Lanka as well.”

“Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers granted their concurrence to take actions by the Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Governments to appoint a committee comprised of officials in the Elections Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employments and Tourism, the Ministry of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Governments as well as in the other Ministries and institutions to study particulars relevant to amend laws and formulation of new laws to safeguard voting rights of citizens offshores.” (Colombo/September 16/2025)
