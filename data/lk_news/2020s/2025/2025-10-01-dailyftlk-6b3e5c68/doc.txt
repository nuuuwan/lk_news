Ambewela unveils exclusive premier consumer promotion

From Sri Lanka’s most premium fresh milk to luxury holiday experiences

Ambewela, has taken its commitment to consumers beyond the breakfast table by introducing an exclusive consumer promotion that blends daily nourishment with extraordinary experiences.

Ambewela, which is regarded as Sri Lanka’s No. 1 fresh milk brand, has long been a benchmark for dairy excellence in Sri Lanka, trusted by generations for its uncompromising commitment to quality, purity, and nutrition.

Established as the most premium fresh milk brand in the country, Ambewela is produced from its very own farms in the lush hills of Nuwara Eliya, where the finest pastures and advanced farming practices ensure milk of unmatched freshness and taste. Every drop of Ambewela milk embodies the brand’s promise of premium quality, safety, and nourishment, making it a staple in Sri Lankan households.

Staying true to this heritage of excellence, Ambewela is now rewarding its loyal consumers with an experience as premium as the brand itself. The brand has launched an exciting new consumer promotion that gives fresh milk users across the country the chance to win an unforgettable luxury vacation. With every purchase of a 1L Ambewela Fresh Milk or Non-Fat Milk pack, consumers can now stand a chance to win 10 exclusive premium holiday packages. The promotion runs over 10 weeks, rewarding 10 winners, with one lucky winner selected every week.

The mechanism is simple: Consumers need to scan the QR code printed on the 1L pack, fill in their details along with proof of purchase, and follow the Ambewela Facebook page to enter the draw. Each pack purchased is another opportunity to win. Winners will be treated to two-day premium stays at iconic Heritance resorts, Heritance Kandalama, Heritance Tea Factory, or Heritance Ahungalla on a full-board basis. The stays include suite accommodations with butler service, specially curated candlelit dinners, private dining, and complimentary bottles of wine, ensuring a truly indulgent escape. To make the experience even more memorable, winners will also enjoy curated excursions unique to each location.

At Heritance Kandalama, the winners will get an unforgettable wildlife safari adventure through Minneriya, where elephants roam freely across stunning landscapes. Winners of Heritance Tea Factory will be treated to a guided tour of Ambewela, Sri Lanka’s most advanced dairy farm, with an exclusive cheese tasting, followed by a visit to the historic tea factory. Guests of Heritance Ahungalla will enjoy a scenic and enchanting boat ride through the mangroves of Madu Ganga.

Lanka Milk Foods (CWE) PLC CEO Sasanka Perera said: “Ambewela has always stood for uncompromising quality and authenticity, which is why we continue to be the most trusted fresh milk brand in Sri Lanka. From the pristine pastures of Nuwara Eliya to the rigorous quality standards we follow, every drop of Ambewela milk is designed to deliver unmatched purity, freshness, and nourishment to our consumers. It is this promise of excellence that we now extend into rewarding them with experiences that are just as premium and memorable.”

Lanka Milk Foods (CWE) PLC Group Head of Marketing Ruwani Dias said: “This promotion is our way of thanking our loyal consumers who choose Ambewela every day. Just as our milk is crafted to be premium, safe, and nourishing, the holidays we are offering reflect the same values of indulgence, care, and exclusivity. We believe this initiative is not only about winning prizes but also about creating moments of joy and connection that strengthen our bond with our consumers.”

The campaign underscores Ambewela’s philosophy of delivering more than just dairy. By rewarding its loyal consumers with experiences that mirror the brand’s premium values, Ambewela strengthens its connection with households while redefining what a consumer promotion can mean in the local market. Available exclusively across modern trade supermarket channels, including Keells, Cargills Food City, Glomark, Arpico, and SPAR, the initiative highlights how Ambewela continues to innovate in creating meaningful value for its consumers.

With this latest promotion, Ambewela said it reaffirms its position not only as Sri Lanka’s benchmark for dairy excellence but also as a brand committed to enriching the lives of its consumers through memorable, premium experiences that go far beyond the product itself.
