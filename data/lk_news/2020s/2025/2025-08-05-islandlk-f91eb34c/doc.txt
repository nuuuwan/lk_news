‘City of Dreams’ is a long-term bet on Sri Lanka’s potential: Krishan Balendra

John Keells Holdings (JKH) officially launched City of Dreams Sri Lanka, a landmark $2 billion+ integrated resort, on August 2, 2025, marking the largest private-sector investment in the country’s history. The project, developed in partnership with Melco Resorts and Entertainment – a global hospitality leader and operator of casino gaming facilities aims to redefine Sri Lanka’s tourism and economic landscape while instilling confidence in the nation’s future.

JKH Chairperson Krishan Balendra described the project as more than just a physical development – “it is a declaration of belief in Sri Lanka’s resilience and potential,” he said.

“Through every challenge from the global pandemic to economic headwinds – we have chosen to invest, not retreat; to innovate, not imitate; to lead, not follow. And that’s what we are doing today. COD is designed not just for this generation but for the next,” Balendra stated.

Two luxury hotels – Cinnamon Life (687 rooms) and the ultra-exclusive Nuwa (113 rooms).

Balendra outlined key benefits for Sri Lanka’s economy as follows:

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI): The project signals Sri Lanka’s stability to global investors.

Tourism Transformation: Positions Colombo as a world-class destination, attracting high-spending travellers from India, China, the Middle East, and beyond.

GDP Contribution: Expected to drive long-term economic growth and infrastructure development.

Conceived in 2010–2011 post-war, the project targets India’s booming outbound tourism market while capitalizing on Sri Lanka’s natural attractions including beaches, wildlife, and cultural heritage.

Melco CEO Lawrence Ho highlighted Sri Lanka’s potential to become “to India what Macau is to China,” given its proximity and diverse appeal.

During the panel discussion, it was noted that after nearly a decade of lobbying and contention, Sri Lanka formalised gaming regulations in 2023, enabling licensed international operators like Melco to invest in the sector.

Responding to a pre-submitted query by The Island Financial Review about COD’s projected earnings, Balendra said there was no ‘guidance’ on earnings but noted that multiple revenue streams – hotels, gaming, banqueting, retail, and real estate – would deliver returns ‘in the medium term’, aligning with JKH’s focus on sustainable capital growth.

“We know that the project is not going to bring returns overnight,” he clarified.

Closing his speech, Balendra thanked stakeholders and reaffirmed JKH’s commitment to shaping Sri Lanka’s future: “Sri Lanka’s best days are ahead, and JKH will continue to contribute to shaping it.” His words heightened the excitement in the room.
