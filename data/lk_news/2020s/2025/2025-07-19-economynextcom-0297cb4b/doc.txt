Sri Lanka tea traders ask govt to act against low-quality producers

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Tea Traders’ Association has urged the government to strictly enforce the law against factories that compromise quality during tea production, the President’s Media Division said.

In recent years, Sri Lanka’s tea industry—long celebrated for its premium Ceylon tea—has been grappling with rising production costs, fluctuating global demand, and a volatile economic climate.

Faced with mounting pressure to remain competitive in international markets, some tea producers have begun compromising on quality to cut costs, using lower-grade leaves, reducing plucking intervals, and relying on less-skilled labour, undermining the very brand identity that Ceylon tea has cultivated for over a century.

Exporters have raised alarm over declining quality, warning that such practices could erode consumer trust in key markets like the EU, Japan, and the Middle East.

The Tea Traders Association’s request came at a discussion with President’s Secretary and higher official on Thursday (17).

“The discussion reviewed the issues that have emerged within Sri Lanka’s tea industry. Special attention was paid to improving the quality of tea leaves and the productivity of tea cultivation and exploring new international market opportunities,” the PMD said in a statement.

“Discussions also covered the future programme to be implemented by the Ministry of Plantation and Community Infrastructure regarding tea cultivation, including the establishment of a formal data system and the need for its proper follow-up.” (Colombo/July 18/2025)
