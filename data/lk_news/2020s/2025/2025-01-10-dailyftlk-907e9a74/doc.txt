No recent HMPV cases in SL: Health Minister

Health Minister Nalinda Jayatissa said Sri Lanka’s health authorities are on the alert on the spread of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) and no patients have been confirmed in the country so far.

He said there was one suspected patient but tests were negative. Speaking in parliament yesterday, (9 Jan.), he said 20 locations had been named to conduct tests while the Epidemiology Unit was providing regular updates and taking necessary precautionary steps.

Minister Dr. Jayatissa said the media reports went viral saying a HMPV patient had been detected in Sri Lanka had misquoted immunologist Prof. Neelika Malavige’s statement. Rejecting news reports as false, he said they were published in a manner to create fear among people but Prof.

Malavige had correctly stated that Sri Lanka had identified a HMPV patient before the current outbreak and not during the present outbreak, which was a seasonal winter occurrence in China.

The Health Minister requested the media to report in a responsible manner when reporting sensitive issues affecting the lives of people.
