US firm signs $15mn investment in Sri Lanka for accreditation facilities

ECONOMYNEXT – STEMedical of the United States signed a 15 million dollar investment deal with Sri Lanka’s Institute of Biotechnology (SLIBTEC) to establish a laboratory with internationally recognized accreditation, President’s Media Division said.

A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed on Tuesday (15) for the project which will be conducted under the guidance of the National Initiative for Research and Development Commercialisation (NIRDC).

Hans Keirstead, founder of the American company STEMedical signed on behalf of the U.S. firm while SLIBTEC Chairman Samitha Hettige and Chief Operating Officer Amali Ranasinghe signed on behalf of the local firm.

Professor Gomika Udugamasooriya, Senior Presidential Advisor on Science and Technology, said such accreditation facilities would help the government’s objective of doubling the country’s export revenue by the year 2030.

The laboratory is expected to function as a main lab, working in conjunction with existing laboratories across the island, to ensure the quality of goods and services in various fields.

Keirstead of STEMedical said the project would bring many benefits to the country both clinically and economically.

He also said the new investment would attract the attention of economic experts and generate revenue by bringing items, such as medicines, from other countries to Sri Lanka for accreditation. (Colombo/July 15/2025)
