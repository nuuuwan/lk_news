Newly-appointed Representative and Country Director of the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) in Sri Lanka Philip Ward has formally presented his letter of credentials to Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism Minister Vijitha Herath at the Ministry premises.

In his discussions with Minister Herath, Ward reaffirmed the WFP’s commitment to supporting Sri Lanka’s efforts to strengthen food systems, improve nutrition, and build resilience among vulnerable communities.

“I am honoured to take up this role at a time when Sri Lanka is navigating both progress and persistent challenges in food security and nutrition,” said Ward. “The WFP remains steadfast in its support to national efforts, working hand in hand with partners to ensure access to nutritious food, especially for those most at risk.”

Ward and Minister Herath discussed the WFP’s Country Strategic Plan, and Sri Lanka’s progress in reducing malnutrition and strengthening community resilience in the face of climate and economic shocks. Ward emphasised the WFP’s role as a trusted partner in ensuring that no one is left behind on the path to recovery and long-term stability.

Ward brings over three decades of experience in humanitarian and development work with the WFP, including senior leadership roles in field operations, strategic partnerships, and organisational leadership, making Ward well-positioned to guide the WFP’s efforts in Sri Lanka with a renewed focus and vision.
