At least 11 people have been injured in a stabbing at a Walmart supermarket in Michigan, authorities say.

One suspect was in custody following the incident in Traverse City, authorities confirmed. Local media reports said three people were undergoing surgery.

A nearby hospital said it was treating 11 victims. “As a result, our Emergency Department is currently experiencing a higher-than-usual volume of patients,” Munson Medical Centre said on social media.

Footage posted online shows multiple police and ambulance units in the carpark of the Walmart.

Grand Traverse County Sheriff’s Office confirmed it was investigating “a multiple stabbing incident at the Wal-Mart in Traverse City”.

FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said federal personnel were responding to provide any necessary support to local authorities.

Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said she was “in touch with law enforcement about the horrible news”.

“Our thoughts are with the victims and the community reeling from this brutal act of violence,” she added.
