Sri Lanka’s tobacco trap: The $500 million fiscal sinkhole

While many nations struggle with high smoking rates, Sweden has carved a unique and successful path, poised to become Europe’s first “smoke-free” country with just 5.3% of adults smoking. The question at the heart of the recent “Quit Like Sweden” roundtable in Colombo was not whether this success can be replicated, but how South Asia can adapt this model to avert a looming public health crisis.

The Swedish achievement is no accident. It is the result of a pragmatic policy that combines traditional anti-smoking measures while ensuring that safer alternatives to cigarettes are accessible and affordable. This approach, known as Tobacco Harm Reduction (THR), was the central theme at the roundtable.

For Sri Lanka, the stakes are critically high. Professor Rohan Sequeira, a Senior Consultant Cardio-Endocrine Physician, presented a stark reality. “We in South Asia are in the epicenter of tobacco-related oral cancer and heart diseases worldwide,” he stated.

Professor Sequeira then delivered an economic argument that demands policymakers’ attention. In 2023, the government collected approximately USD 500 million in tobacco taxes. In that same year, it spent an estimated USD 490 million treating tobacco-related diseases. “What you get in taxes, you spend back in healthcare. It doesn’t make sense,” he said, noting that this one-to-one ratio highlights a fiscal sinkhole that drains resources from other essential social priorities.

The solution, experts argued, lies in embracing harm reduction. Evidence shows that switching to safer nicotine products can reduce harm by up to 95% compared to combustible cigarettes. A recent “Lives Saved” report for Sri Lanka projects that integrating THR policies could save 85,000 lives by 2060 and potentially save the healthcare system billions of dollars over the coming decades.

However, a significant regulatory barrier exists. Unlike Sweden, where products like snus and nicotine pouches are widely available, Sri Lanka prohibits heated tobacco products and maintains a confusing regulatory landscape for safer alternatives. This leaves heavy smokers with no legal, less harmful options – a policy that Professor Fredrik Nystrom of Linköping University warned can be counterproductive. “Smokers aren’t criminals, and therefore, stigmatising them excessively can actually push the behavior underground,” he noted.

The roundtable concluded that for Sri Lanka, a practical path forward must include risk-proportionate regulation, where safer alternatives are made more accessible than deadly cigarettes, coupled with professional cessation support and public communication to guide consumers, particularly those from lower economic strata who are most affected.

“The Swedish example proves that a smoke-free future is achievable. For Sri Lanka, adopting a similar, pragmatic approach is not just a public health opportunity, but an economic imperative. It’s up to the authorities of the government to engage with these experts as they have submitted a report to the government in July 2024 on THR”, a tobacco control researcher in the audience shared with The Island.
