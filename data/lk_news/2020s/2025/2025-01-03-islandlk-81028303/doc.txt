Hidden Marvels of Moths

In the world of insects, moths often remain in the shadows—both literally and figuratively. While butterflies are celebrated for their beauty and vibrancy, moths are frequently dismissed as dull or even bothersome.

Yet, as Nuwan Chaturanga, a Lepidoptera expert who is also specialising in Sri Lanka’s ecosystems, reveals, moths are far from ordinary. These nocturnal insects possess fascinating adaptations, play pivotal ecological roles, and carry cultural significance that deserves a closer look.

Moths have evolved into masters of survival, developing traits that enable them to navigate, evade predators, and thrive in diverse environments.

Chaturanga highlights some of the most remarkable adaptations: “Moths have developed nocturnal vision and ultrasonic hearing, allowing them to evade predators like bats effectively.” These features place moths among the most specialised creatures in the animal kingdom.

Their wing patterns offer another layer of protection, serving as camouflage or mimicry. Some moths resemble tree bark, leaves, or even other dangerous creatures to deter predators. “This evolutionary ingenuity is breathtaking,” Chaturanga says, adding that certain species, such as the owlet moth, use eyespots on their wings to mimic larger predators, startling attackers long enough to make an escape.

In addition, their erratic flight patterns make them difficult for predators to capture mid-air. These adaptations, combined with chemical defences like toxins and foul-tasting substances derived from their larval diet, make moths a marvel of evolution.

Moths are not just survivors; they are indispensable contributors to ecosystems worldwide, particularly in Sri Lanka. Chaturanga sheds light on their critical role as nocturnal pollinators.

“Moths are essential for pollinating native plants that bloom at night, such as certain orchids and fruit trees,” he explains. Unlike bees and butterflies, which dominate daytime pollination, moths ensure the reproduction of plants that rely on night-time visitors.

Beyond pollination, moths also form an integral part of the food web. Birds, bats, and small mammals rely on moths as a primary food source. Their larvae, or caterpillars, feed on plants and serve as prey for other species, maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.

However, their ecological importance is often overlooked due to misconceptions about their role. “Many people think moths are only pests, but this is far from the truth,” Chaturanga asserts. While a few species, like the rice leaf folder moth, are harmful to crops, the majority contribute positively to agriculture and natural habitats.

Moths’ reputation has been marred by myths and misunderstandings, particularly in Sri Lanka. “Large black moths are often seen as harbingers of bad luck or death,” Chaturanga says. These superstitions, rooted in folklore rather than science, have contributed to their negative image.

Another widespread belief is that moths are dull and unattractive. Yet, Sri Lanka is home to many stunningly colourful moth species, some rivaling butterflies in beauty. Chaturanga highlights the Atlas Moth as an example—a species with wings spanning up to 12 inches, adorned with intricate patterns.

Additionally, while moths are often blamed for crop damage, Chaturanga clarifies that only a handful of species pose significant threats. “The fear of moths being destructive is largely exaggerated,” he notes, emphasising the need for education to dispel these misconceptions.

Studying moths presents unique challenges, as Chaturanga explains. “The sheer diversity of moth species makes it difficult to study them comprehensively.” With over 160,000 known species worldwide, and many more yet to be discovered, the task is daunting.

Adding to the complexity is their nocturnal behavior. “Most moths are active at night, which complicates field studies,” Chaturanga says. Researchers often rely on light traps and other nocturnal observation techniques, which are labor-intensive and logistically challenging.

Another hurdle is their small size and morphological similarity. Advanced tools like microscopes and DNA analysis are often required to identify species accurately. In Sri Lanka, the lack of local expertise and funding further hampers research efforts. “We need more trained entomologists and financial support to uncover the full scope of moth biodiversity,” Chaturanga emphasizes.

Moths are not just biological marvels but also cultural icons. Across the world, they are steeped in folklore and symbolism, often representing themes of transformation, mystery, and fragility.

In Sri Lanka, moths are commonly associated with superstition. “Large black moths are linked to death or bad luck, but these beliefs are purely cultural,” Chaturanga says. In contrast, Western folklore often portrays moths as harbingers of misfortune, with the death’s-head hawk moth being a notable example.

In Japan, moths are sometimes seen as symbols of fragility or decay but also hold spiritual significance, representing connections to the afterlife. Similarly, in Aztec mythology, moths were linked to fire and transformation, often featuring in rituals. These cultural interpretations highlight the profound impact moths have had on human imagination.

Moths face significant threats in the modern world, from habitat destruction to climate change. “Deforestation is destroying their natural habitats, while climate change disrupts their breeding cycles and food availability,” Chaturanga explains. These factors have led to declining populations in many regions, including Sri Lanka.

Compounding the issue is the lack of data on rare and endangered species. “We suspect that many moth species in Sri Lanka are either rare or threatened, but there’s insufficient research to confirm this,” Chaturanga laments. It’s possible that some species may have gone extinct before being scientifically described.

Moths are not without their quirks. Chaturanga points to the death’s-head hawk moth, known for its ability to emit a squeaking sound when threatened. Another intriguing behavior is lachryphagy, where certain moth species drink tears from animals, a phenomenon observed in tropical regions.

These behaviors, while unusual, underscore the diversity and adaptability of moths. From mimicry to chemical defenses, their survival strategies are as varied as they are fascinating.

Moths’ relationship with agriculture is a double-edged sword. On the positive side, they pollinate crops such as bananas and guava, contributing to food production. However, their larvae can also be destructive, with pests like the armyworm moth posing challenges for farmers.

Balancing their ecological benefits against their impact as pests requires a nuanced approach. “By understanding their life cycles and behaviors, we can manage pest species while preserving beneficial ones,” Chaturanga suggests.

The future of moth populations depends on collective conservation efforts. Chaturanga emphasizes simple yet impactful actions individuals can take:

These steps, combined with increased research and funding, can help protect moths and the ecosystems they support.

Moths are more than just nocturnal insects fluttering in the dark. They are vital pollinators, ecological balancers, and symbols of transformation. Nuwan concludes: “Moths teach us resilience and the interconnectedness of life. It’s time we give them the recognition they deserve.”

By appreciating their beauty, understanding their roles, and addressing the challenges they face, we can ensure that these remarkable creatures continue to thrive, illuminating the night for generations to come.
