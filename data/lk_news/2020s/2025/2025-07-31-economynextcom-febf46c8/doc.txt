Trump imposes 15 tariff on Korea, suspends de minimis citing drugs

ECONOMYNEXT – Korean goods will be subject to a tariff of 15 percent, President Donald Trump said in a social media post, while also suspending de minimis duty exemptions for goods.

Korea will give 350 billion dollars “for Investments owned and controlled by the United States, and selected by myself, as President,” he said.

“Additionally, South Korea will purchase $100 Billion Dollars of LNG, or other Energy products and, further, South Korea has agreed to invest a large sum of money for their Investment purposes,” Trump said.

“This sum will be announced within the next two weeks when the President of South Korea, Lee Jae Myung, comes to the White House for a Bilateral Meeting.

“It is also agreed that South Korea will be completely OPEN TO TRADE with the United States, and that they will accept American product including Cars and Trucks, Agriculture, etc. We have agreed to a Tariff for South Korea of 15%. America will not be charged a Tariff.”

President Trump also ended de minimis exemptions – duty free entry for parcels below 800 US dollars – through an executive order.

He claimed drugs were being sent through the system and there was tariff evasion specifically citing Canada and Mexico. Reports said large volumes of trade with Canada were carried out through de minimis exemptions that he wanted to suspend.

Goods coming through the international postal system would still be allowed in, subject to Trump tariffs on the country of origin and a fee until the US Customs comes up with a system to track them.

President Trump has sent shocks across the US and global economy – a problem economists call regime uncertainty – ending the policy stability that had attracted large volumes of foreign capital to the country.

The foreign capital in turn triggered the trade deficit which he is trying to stop through tariffs in a mistaken idea about how economies work. (Colombo/July31/2025)
