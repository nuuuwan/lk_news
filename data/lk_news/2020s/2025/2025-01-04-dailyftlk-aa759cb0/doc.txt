UNP appoints Thalatha Athukorala as new General Secretary

Former MP Thalatha Athukorala has been appointed as the General Secretary of the United National Party (UNP).

UNP Chairman Wajira Abeywardana said that the appointment was made by Party Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Prior to the 2024 Presidential Election, Athukorala stepped down from the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) citing differences of opinion within the party. She extended her support to former President Ranil Wickremesinghe in the 2024 Presidential Election, during a rally in Welimada.
