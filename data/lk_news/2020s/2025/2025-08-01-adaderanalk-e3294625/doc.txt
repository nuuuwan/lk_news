“The reduction of the tariff rate imposed by the United States on Sri Lankan goods to 20% is a victory and will enable us to further maintain the regional competitiveness of our exports,” he stated.

He also thanked the United States for recognizing the challenges faced by Sri Lanka as a smaller economy and for extending this trade relief.

Dr. de Silva further emphasized the need to continue working toward integrating Sri Lanka more effectively into the global economy, noting that more such “victories” are possible through proactive efforts to ease trade barriers.

“I emphasize that by understanding such situations and working to ease the trade barriers in Sri Lanka and integrate Sri Lanka with the world, many more victories will be achieved.”

Concluding his remarks, he urged all stakeholders to adopt a forward-looking approach:

“Let’s now seriously work on breaking down the walls around us and building bridges to the world!”
