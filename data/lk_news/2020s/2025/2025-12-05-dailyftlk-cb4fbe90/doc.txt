JICA donates essential relief supplies

A significant consignment of emergency relief items donated by the Government of Japan has been officially handed over to the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) through Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to strengthen Sri Lanka’s ongoing response to the devastation caused by Cyclone Ditwah.

The consignment, which arrived in Sri Lanka on Wednesday was formally handed yesterday by Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka Akio Isomata and the Chief Representative of JICA Sri Lanka Kenji Kuronuma who presented the supplies to Deputy Minister of Defence Major General Aruna Jayasekara (Retd) and Disaster Management Centre Director General Maj. Gen. Sampath Kotuwegoda (Retd).

The consignment includes a range of essential humanitarian items aimed at supporting displaced families and restoring basic living conditions in hard-hit areas. The items include 200 Tents, 1,200 Blankets, 1,200 Sleeping Pads, 20 Plastic Sheets (Tarpaulin), 200 Portable Jerry Cans and 10 Water Purifiers.

These supplies will be distributed primarily across the Badulla and Kandy districts, which were among the most severely affected by the cyclone Ditwah, resulting in widespread displacement, damaged homes and disrupted livelihoods.
