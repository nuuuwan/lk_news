Slim Pharmaceuticals appoints Riza Cassim as CEO

Slim Pharmaceuticals Ltd., has announced the appointment of Riza Cassim as its new Chief Executive Officer.

With over three decades of experience across multinational pharmaceutical giants, Cassim brings a wealth of expertise, a proven track record of leadership, and a clear vision for the future of Slim Pharmaceuticals.

Founded in 2011, Slim Pharmaceuticals has steadily emerged as a trusted name in the pharmaceutical sector, offering a diverse portfolio that spans generic medicines, biologics, biosimilars, nutraceuticals, surgical instruments, diagnostics, and cosmeceuticals. The company has built long-standing partnerships with over 35 globally renowned manufacturers, including Roche, Baxter, and Otsuka, while serving more than 2,500 hospitals and pharmacies across Sri Lanka through a robust islandwide distribution network. Its guiding mission has been clear from inception: to combine international quality with accessibility and affordability, thereby transforming wellness for every Sri Lankan.

Cassim, a veteran marketer and industry leader, steps into his new role with a decorated career spanning over 30 years in the pharmaceutical sector. His journey began at Sanofi (formerly Hoechst) and later at Pfizer as Brand Manager, before taking on senior leadership roles, including Head of Operations at Mylan USA and Micro Labs India. He subsequently led AstraZeneca as Country Head, earning recognition for outstanding performance, including two Hemas CEO Awards, two Country of the Year Frontier Market Awards (India and Vietnam), and the Best Branding in Frontier Market Award in Vietnam.

His leadership enabled brands under his purview to dominate therapeutic categories, with two superbrands reaching the top of IMS rankings in Q1 2020. His strategic acumen and deep knowledge across therapeutic segments — including cardiology, gastroenterology, and endocrinology — continue to shape his vision for Slim Pharmaceuticals.

“I am honoured to take on the role of CEO at such a pivotal time for Slim Pharmaceuticals,” said Cassim. “Having worked with multinational companies for nearly three decades, I am eager to channel this experience into building a stronger, more competitive, and more accessible pharmaceutical company in Sri Lanka. Our ambition is clear: to position Slim Pharmaceuticals among the top 10 importers of pharmaceuticals by 2028 and among the top 5 by 2030. This is not just a business goal but about delivering trust, accessibility, and high-quality care to every patient nationwide.”

Cassim’s guiding tagline as CEO is “Creating Exceptional Outcomes,” a philosophy that reflects his commitment to excellence, innovation, and impact in every aspect. Under his leadership, Slim Pharmaceuticals has laid out a three-year plan and a six-year long-range projection. The strategy includes introducing new brands, targeted entry into niche markets, expansion through line extensions, and potential acquisitions. The company will also deepen its focus on biosimilars, innovative medicines, and high-growth therapeutic segments such as cardiology, anti-diabetics, and neuropsychiatry, which are expected to drive double-digit growth in the coming years.

“The role of a CEO is not just to oversee operations, but to create sustainable strategies that benefit patients and partners alike,” Cassim added. “Our goal is to ensure that every business unit within Slim contributes meaningfully to our growth while upholding the highest standards of ethics, compliance, and innovation.”

Slim Pharmaceuticals has consistently supplied to Sri Lanka’s Government healthcare sector for over 13 years, ensuring reliability and trust. Cassim emphasises that affordability will remain at the core of Slim’s strategy, supported by sourcing from FDA — and EU GMP-certified manufacturing plants in emerging markets such as Turkey. This approach ensures that patients benefit from European-quality medicines at costs comparable to Indian alternatives.

“Our guiding principle is accessibility without compromise,” Cassim explained. “We are committed to bringing affordable, high-quality medicines to Sri Lanka, ensuring every patient — regardless of income — has access to essential care.”
