American College of Higher Education celebrates Transfer and Graduation Ceremony 2025

Education (ACHE) proudly held its Transfer and Graduation Ceremony 2025 on July 29, 2025, at the Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel, Colombo, marking another milestone in its 30-year legacy of academic excellence.

ACHE, a pioneering higher education institution in Sri Lanka, serves as an off-campus instructional site of Keiser University, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA, offering programs approved by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC). Through its 2+2 University Transfer Program, ACHE enables students to complete the first two years of an American degree in Sri Lanka before transferring to over 4,000 universities in the U.S., Canada, and other countries.

The ceremony’s Chief Guest, Professor Terrence Madhujith, Vice Chancellor of the University of Peradeniya, commended ACHE for its role in providing globally recognized education to Sri Lankan students.

“While many students pass their Advanced Levels, only a limited number secure placements in state universities. Institutions like ACHE play a crucial role in helping students achieve their dreams through accredited, internationally recognized education,” he said.

Reflecting on the challenges faced by graduates including the pandemic and economic crisis, he praised their resilience and dedication.

“You have undergone rigorous academic training, gained new skills, and embraced innovative concepts. As you step into the next chapter of your lives, celebrate your achievements and remain focused on your future goals. Most importantly, enjoy the journey ahead, and be grateful to your loved ones who have supported you to achieve your goals and aspirations in your life and in your career,” he said.

Dr. Sherryn Yaseen, CEO of ACHE, expressed immense pride in the graduates and acknowledged the presence of Dr. Yan Luo-Beitler, Associate Vice Chancellor of International Affairs at Keiser University, Florida, USA, who traveled all the way from there to confer degrees.

“Dr. Yan has been instrumental in strengthening the collaboration between ACHE and Keiser University, opening doors for our students to pursue world-class education,” Dr. Yaseen remarked.

As the only U.S.-approved higher education provider in Sri Lanka (accredited by SACSCOC), ACHE has facilitated over 5,000 students in transferring to prestigious universities across the U.S. and Europe in the past three decades. These alumni now excel in diverse fields worldwide, a testament to ACHE’s commitment to academic excellence.

With its main campus in Dehiwala and branches in Kandy, Galle, Negombo, and Kurunegala, ACHE continues to empower Sri Lankan students with accessible, high-quality education pathways to global success.
