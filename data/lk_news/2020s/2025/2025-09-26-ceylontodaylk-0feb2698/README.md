# Unpaid compensation in X-Press Pearl case: SC Orders AG to Report on Possible Legal Action

The Supreme Court, yesterday (25), directed the Attorney General to report on the possible legal action that can be taken against the foreign company linked to the MV X-Press Pearl vessel for failing to pay Court-ordered compensation for the environmental and economic damage caused by the ship’s fire and sinking. The report must be submitted on 26 January 2026.

The order was issued when a Fundamental Rights Petition related to the incident was taken up before a Three-Judge Bench comprising Justices Shiran Gunaratne, Achala Wengappuli, and Priyantha Fernando.

The petition was filed following a motion by Sea Consortium Lanka, the local representative of the X-Press Pearl, seeking clarification on compensation payments.

During the hearing, the counsel representing X-Press Feeders, the foreign company named as a respondent, withdrew his appearance, and no fresh representation was made on behalf of the company.

Appearing for the petitioners, Attorney-at-Law Ravindranath Dabare told Court that the Supreme Court had previously ordered the foreign company to pay USD 1 billion in compensation within one year for the environmental disaster, including USD 250 million on or before 23 September. However, he noted that no payments had been made to date, amounting to Contempt of Court, and called for appropriate legal action against the company and its directors.

Attorney-at-Law Himali Kularatne, representing the fishing community, also argued that the company’s failure to comply with the compensation order constituted Contempt of Court.

President’s Counsel K. Kanag-Isvaran, representing Sea Consortium Lanka, informed Court that his client had already paid Rs 300 million as part of the compensation but was financially unable to make any further payments. He emphasised that the company had acted in compliance with the Court’s order to the extent possible and had not committed contempt.

Deputy Solicitor General Madhava Tennakoon, appearing for the Attorney General’s Department, said arrangements were being made to establish a Compensation Commission and an Environmental Damage Assessment Commission as previously ordered by the Court. He also reiterated that the company’s failure to pay the ordered sum amounted to Contempt of Court.

Justice Achala Wengappuli, addressing the open Court, remarked that the Supreme Court had done everything within its legal power to ensure compensation was recovered but that the next steps, including enforcement, were the responsibility of the executive. He noted that imprisoning the directors of the respondent company alone would not resolve the issue.

The Court then ordered that the case be called again on 26 January to review the progress of the compensation recovery process.

Four Fundamental Rights petitions had been filed in connection with the disaster by Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, the Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ), and two other parties, seeking compensation for the damage caused to the environment and to fishing communities.
