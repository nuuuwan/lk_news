Fundraiser for veterans

Gajaba Unity Fest 2025 is one musical event you should not miss as it’s for a very worthy cause.

It is happening on 13th September, 2025, at the AC Marquee, Cinnamon Lakeside, and is a fundraiser for the veterans of the Gajaba Regiment.

Yes, it’s going to be an evening of music, unity, and gratitude to honour the brave men and women who have served our nation.

Billed to appear at Gajaba Unity Fest 2025 are Sohan, Mariazelle, Lahiru and Kavindi, with the band Redeemers providing the music, and Dominic Kellar handling the evening’s proceedings.

The action is from 7.00 pm onwards, they say, and with Sohan in the scene, and Mariazelle, as well, it will most certainly be an unforgettable night of music … and entertainment.

You could contact either Sanjith (0714417378) or Rumesh (0777188485) for table reservations.
