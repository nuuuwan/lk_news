# Sri Lanka central bank chief warns of cryptocurrency’s role in money laundering

ECONOMYNEXT – There is no law on using cryptocurrency as an asset class in Sri Lanka, the central bank governor said, but it raises concerns about money laundering.

“Since cryptocurrency is a relatively new thing, no law has been introduced on cryptocurrency, or virtual currency,” Nandalal Weerasinghe told reporters.

“It cannot be used as legal tender in the country as per our foreign exchange act, but it can be used as an asset class, an investment.

“The problem is, we don’t know if it’s used for money laundering.”

Trade Minister Wasantha Samarasinghe, in his asset declaration, has said he holds 3,000 cryptocurrency, sparking debate on whether or not it is illegal. (Colombo/Sep24/2025)
