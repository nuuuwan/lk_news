Gnanasara Thera sentenced to nine months for defamatory remarks on Islam

The Colombo Magistrate’s Court has sentenced Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera to nine months of simple imprisonment for making a defamatory statement about Islam.

The verdict, delivered by Colombo Additional Magistrate Pasan Amarasena, also included a fine of Rs. 1,500. In the event of non-payment, the court ordered an additional one month of imprisonment.

The case, filed under Section 291 of the Penal Code, was based on remarks made by Gnanasara Thero during a press conference held in the Kirulapone area on 16 July 2016. The Thera said, “Islam is a cancer… it must be eradicated,” a statement deemed to incite ethnic disharmony and promote hatred against the Muslim community.

In delivering the judgment, Magistrate Amarasena noted that the prosecution had proven the case beyond reasonable doubt. The court emphasised the importance of maintaining ethnic harmony and condemned the inflammatory nature of the Thera’s speech.

Defence Counsel Gamini Alwis, along with Counsels Sanjaya Ariyadasa, Iresh Seneviratne, Sanjaya Marambe, and Pubudu Wellahewa, represented Gnanasara Thera. They announced their intention to appeal the verdict, expressing dissatisfaction with the court’s decision.
