Ceilao Insurance joins forces with Nawaloka Hospitals to enhance medical accessibility

Ceilao Insurance has announced a groundbreaking exclusive partnership with Nawaloka Hospitals, one of Sri Lanka’s leading private healthcare institutions. This strategic alliance marks a significant milestone in the Sri Lankan insurance and healthcare industries, enabling all current and future Ceilao Insurance Brokers clients—both individual and corporate—to access exclusive discounts on a wide range of medical check-ups and healthcare services at Nawaloka Hospitals.

This initiative is not just a value-added service—it is a bold step toward making premium healthcare more affordable and accessible for every Ceilao client. No other insurance broker in Sri Lanka has achieved such a precedent, reaffirming Ceilao’s position as a pioneering force in the industry.

This initiative is spearheaded by Dr. Manjula Kulatunga, Founder and Director of Ceilao Insurance Brokers. With a professional journey dating back to 1994, Dr. Kulatunga’s expertise spans migration law, telecommunications, investment advisory, and cross-border business development. His leadership across a diversified portfolio of companies—including Australian Migration Consultants, Ceilao Logistics Group, Australian Talent Network, Eco Absorbent, Ceilao Tea and Ceilao Ezy—has transformed industries and empowered communities across Sri Lanka, Australia, UAE, Qatar, and beyond.

“Ceilao Insurance Brokers offers a holistic insurance experience, designed to simplify and safeguard your organization’s future and customized coverage aligned to mitigate specific risks”, said a company spokesman.
