NDB secures Gold at SLIM DIGIS 2.5 Awards

National Development Bank PLC (NDB) secured the Gold Award at the prestigious SLIM DIGIS 2.5 Awards for its innovative “NDB Avurudu Dupatha” campaign. This groundbreaking initiative successfully merged gaming, digital storytelling, and banking to promote the NDB NEOS app among younger Sri Lankan audiences.

Executed in collaboration with Gamer.LK during the festive Avurudu season, the campaign departed from traditional marketing. It immersed users in an engaging digital adventure where popular gaming influencers battled an “Economic Demon” to save a virtual island. The narrative cleverly integrated the NEOS app’s functionalities such as QR payments, fund transfers, and online account opening into the gameplay. This allowed Gen Z and Millennial viewers to experience the app’s convenience in an interactive and relatable context.

Darshana Jayasinghe, Head of Marketing at NDB, described the campaign as a fusion of digital banking and community storytelling, emphasizing its success in authentically connecting with youth.
