Health Minister urges SL specialist docs abroad to return home

Health Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa has called on specialist doctors of Sri Lankan origin working overseas to return and serve the country, highlighting the critical shortage of medical specialists in the nation.

The Minister made these remarks while addressing a meeting of doctors organised by the Sri Lankan High Commission during his recent visit to the United Kingdom.

He asserted that producing a specialist doctor takes considerable time and personal sacrifice, especially in the current economic and social environment, making the return of Sri Lankan-trained specialists essential for the country’s healthcare system.

Assuring returning doctors, the Minister stated that they would be reinstated in their respective ranks with all service facilities and provided with the necessary support to resume their professional duties in Sri Lanka.

The conference, organised by the High Commission at the invitation of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD), was attended by numerous specialists, doctors and other professionals of Sri Lankan origin.

The Sri Lankan delegation to the UK included Speaker Dr. Jagath Wickramaratne, Justice Minister Harshana Nanayakkara, Women and Children’s Affairs Minister Saroja Savitri Paulraj and Assistant Secretary General of Parliament Hansa Abeyratne. The gathering focused on strengthening ties with the Sri Lankan diaspora and encouraging contributions to the nation’s healthcare development.
