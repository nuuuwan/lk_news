Sri Lanka to offer concessional loans to draw youth to agriculture, industry

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet of ministers have approved a concessional loan scheme at 4 percent interest to encourage younger people into the agricultural and industrial sectors, minister Nalinda Jayatissa said.

“It has been proposed to provide a maximum loan facility of 5 million rupees to a beneficiary,” Jayatissa told reporters.

A 4 percent interest is to be charged per annum and the scheme will be implemented over 5 years.

“The lack of concessional financial facilities has been identified as an obstacle to creating entrepreneurs in the agricultural sector.”

This reduces the attractiveness of agriculture for young entrepreneurs, increases the amount of uncultivated land and reduces food production, he said.

The 2025 budget has made a provision of 500 million rupees for the concessional loan scheme for the development, he said.

The government’s objective is to create 50,000 agricultural entrepreneurs within 5 years, Jayatissa said.
