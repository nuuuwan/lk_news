British Council’s South Asia Deep Dialogues event in Colombo

The British Council’s South Asia Deep Dialogues event took place from 10-11 December in Colombo. With the theme of: “‘Widening access to quality tertiary education through transnational education’, Deep Dialogues brought leading experts, policymakers, and education sector professionals from the UK and South Asia to discuss the potential of transnational education (TNE), particularly as a significant driver of educational transformation, the knowledge economy and sustainable development goals.

Trust and respect are fundamental to establishing mutually beneficial partnerships that will significantly improve the quality of teaching, curricula, policies, and, ultimately, the student experience.

Quality assurance needs to be at the heart of TNE development and delivery so that students receive high quality education. At the same time, higher education and quality assurance systems must be resilient enough to navigate the evolving landscape of course delivery, content, and student diversity, while fostering trust and confidence among all stakeholders.

As TNE expands and transforms, education leaders face increasingly complex challenges in balancing local contexts with internationalisation goals. We need resilient, culturally intelligent leaders to navigate diverse stakeholder expectations.

Notable discussions at the Deep Dialogues revolved around creating an understanding of how TNE can make positive contribution to social development goals, lead to employability, exploring various TNE models, discussing quality assurance and approaches to implementation of TNE policy frameworks.
