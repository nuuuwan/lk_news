Japan begins military grant-aid to Sri Lanka with drones for navy

ECONOMYNEXT – Japan has begun military grant aid to Sri Lanka, taking a step beyond its usual support to the Indian Ocean island, through Official Development Assistance (ODA), the Japanese embassy said.

The exchange of notes for the Official Security Assistance (OSA) took place between Akio ISOMATA, Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka, and Vijitha Herath, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka in Tokyo in the presence of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Anura Dissanayake.

In the first project Japan is giving 500 million yen (about a billion rupees) for two types of  Japanese-made drones for the Sri Lanka Navy to be used for for monitoring, surveillance and disaster relief.

“Japan’s first OSA for Sri Lanka signifies that bilateral cooperation in security has entered a new phase,” the embassy said in a statement.

“Launched in 2023, OSA is a new grant aid cooperation framework of Japan to strengthen the security and deterrence capabilities of like-minded countries.

“OSA enables armed forces to be a recipient, differently from “Official Development Assistance (ODA)”, which is for the economic and social development of developing countries.”

Japan will also provide grants up uplift Sri Lanka’s dairy sector with technology. The 464 million yen grant (about 945 million rupees) involves  real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) equipment, and a sperm motility analyzer system.

Technical support will be provided to livestock facilities in the Central, Northern, Eastern, North Central and North West Provinces. (Colombo/Sept30/2025)
