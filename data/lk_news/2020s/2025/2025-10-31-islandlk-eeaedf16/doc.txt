Dialog and Indira Cancer Trust launch ‘A Pledge from the Heart’ via yeheli.lk

Nationwide digital campaign promotes early breast cancer detection with free SMS reminders

Dialog Axiata PLC, Sri Lanka’s #1 connectivity provider, in collaboration with the Indira Cancer Trust, has launched ‘A Pledge from the Heart’, a nationwide digital awareness campaign through its women’s empowerment platform, yeheli.lk, reaffirming its commitment to improving health outcomes through inclusive technology and early detection.

As part of the campaign, yeheli.lk now offers a free monthly SMS reminder service encouraging regular breast self-exams. The service is available to all Sri Lankans, across any mobile network, helping make early detection a consistent part of women’s health routines nationwide.

Breast cancer remains the most common cancer among Sri Lankan women, with 15 new diagnoses and 3 lives lost every day. Studies show that 1 in 8 women will experience breast cancer in her lifetime — yet many cases are detected too late, reducing the chances of successful treatment. Regular self-exams continue to be one of the simplest and most effective ways to save lives.

yeheli.lk, Sri Lanka’s first anonymous, trilingual (Sinhala, Tamil, and English) digital advisory platform, provides expert-verified guidance on health, legal, and psychosocial matters — creating a safe, accessible space for women and men alike to seek support on topics they may find difficult to discuss openly.

Through ‘A Pledge from the Heart,’ Dialog and the Indira Cancer Trust aim to normalise conversations around breast health, empower women with accurate information, and drive a national culture of early detection. The campaign reflects Dialog’s broader purpose of using technology to serve society — ensuring life-saving information reaches every woman with dignity, relevance, and ease.
