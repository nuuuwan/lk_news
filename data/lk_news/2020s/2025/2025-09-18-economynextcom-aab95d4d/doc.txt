Sri Lanka tourism institution joins GovPay

ECONOMYNEXT – The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) has joined GovPay, the government’s digital payment platform, which will enable more online payments within the industry, the organization said.

This will allow tourism industry operators across the country to pay the Tourism Development Levy including under-payments, defaults, and late payments through their banks’ internet and mobile banking portals or any FinTech app connected to GovPay, SLTDA said in a statement.

“This integration enables seamless, secure, and hassle-free online payments for a wide range of SLTDA services, offering greater convenience to stakeholders across the tourism ecosystem.”

With GovPay, SLTDA aims to streamline processes, reduce administrative hurdles, and create a more transparent and efficient business environment, it said.

“By integrating with this platform, we expect a significant boost in efficiency across tourism-related transactions, making Sri Lanka an even more attractive destination for investors and visitors alike,” Buddhika Hewawasam, Chairman of SLTDA, said.

Digital payment platforms of 14 banks including Amana Bank, Bank of Ceylon, Cargills Bank, Commercial Bank, DFCC Bank, HNB, Nations Trust Bank, NDB Bank, National Savings Bank, Pan Asia Bank, People’s Bank, Sampath Bank, SDB Bank and Seylan Bank along with 6 FinTech apps including CIM by LB Finance, FriMi, Genie, Helapay, iPay and WEBXPAY, support payments to SLTDA via GovPay.

SLTDA is the 134th institution to have been onboarded GovPay.

“With TDL payments and license renewals now powered by GovPay, the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority is embracing digital payments in a way that delivers real value to the industry,” Harsha Purasinghe, Board Director of ICTA, said, adding, this “not only saves time and effort for tourism institutions but also ensures a smoother, more reliable service experience for all stakeholders.”

“Our role in GovPay underscores our commitment to fostering a cashless economy and promoting financial inclusion,” Channa de Silva, CEO of LankaPay said.

The initial rollout with SLTDA will focus on services linked to the Tourism Development Levy, with a phased expansion planned to include other payments.

This is a collaboration between SLTDA, ICTA, and LankaPay. (Colombo/Sep18/2025)
