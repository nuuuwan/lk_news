The maverick Buddhist genius of 20th Century Ceylonese Revival: G. P. Malalasekera

In a modest yet powerful way, Professor Gunapala Malalasekera (1899–1973) stands as a monumental figure in Sri Lankan Buddhist education and revival during the twentieth century. His contributions have firmly established his legacy both nationally and internationally within the realms of Pâli and Buddhist Studies. With groundbreaking publications such as The Pâli Literature of Ceylon (1928), Extended Mahâvamsa (1937), and the  Dictionary of Pâli Proper Names (1937–1938), he has set a standard that remains unparalleled (Fig. 1). At the forefront of a vibrant revival of native scholarship in Oriental Studies, Malalasekera shared a rich intellectual environment with contemporaries like Ven. Dr. Walpola Rahula (1907–1997, once his student), Dr. E.W. Adikaram (1905–1985), Dr. A.P. de Zoysa (1890–1968), and Ven. Polvatte Buddhadatta (1887–1962). This article aims to review Professor Gunapala Malasekera: A Photographic Portrait by Venerable Wetara Mahinda (Colombo: Malalasekera Foundation, 2024), pp. 171, ISBN 978-955-3658-02-9, Rs. 2650 (hb) and place Malalasekera in a broader context of colonial religious reforms and Oriental Studies (Fig. 2).

Among the distinguished group of monastic and lay scholars of the twentieth century, Malalasekera emerged as a national hero, celebrated by intellectuals and the public alike. He offered a unique, culturally resonant interpretation of Buddhist revival, which significantly enriched Sri Lanka’s academic, educational, and philanthropic landscapes. His influential roles as a school teacher and principal in the capital, a university professor at the newly founded University College of Ceylon (1921), a far-reaching educationist, a social activist who shaped government agendas, and a diplomatic voice for Buddhist and Ceylonese cultural insights testify to his remarkable impact. His enduring commitment to his beliefs, characterised by profound selflessness, is a rare achievement in the context of the twentieth century. His extraordinary personality exemplifies what the esteemed German sociologist Max Weber (1864–1920) portrayed as “charisma”. The charismatic leadership of Malalasekera has been vividly captured in the nearly one hundred photographs featured throughout this photographic portrait book on Gunapala Malasekera.

This portrait book comprises fifteen key chapters that explore vital themes such as education and diplomacy, showcasing Malalasekera’s exemplary leadership. The insightful “Preface” by Professor Walter Marasinghe highlights intriguing aspects, including Malalasekera’s talent as a playwright. The author’s compelling “Introduction” lays out the fifteen key themes effectively. Distinct from prior publications, this book offers an in-depth exploration complemented by around 100 photographs. It presents a wealth of information that invites future researchers to further investigate the captivating topics introduced, utilising the comprehensive sources provided.

The author effectively demonstrates a commendable level of meticulousness in utilising primary materials, a quality that has become increasingly rare in Sri Lankan scholarship today. Wetara diligently navigated through a wealth of engaging, reliable, and authentic sources during his three years of archival research at the Department of National Archives in Colombo, where I had the pleasure of meeting him. While this work primarily focuses on photographs, it significantly enhances our understanding of Malalasekera’s life and career, making it an important contribution to the field.

As a young novice in late 1970s Sri Lanka, Malalasekera loomed large in my educational journey. Eager to learn English, I spent my hard-earned savings on the hefty English-Sinhala Dictionary (1948), which was unwieldy for my small hands. This cherished resource remains with me, symbolising the profound impact Malalasekera had on those of us educated in Sinhalese and now thriving in professional spheres. Notably, Malalasekera was a pioneering figure in the “Buddhist political activist” movement, playing a vital role in the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress, which laid the groundwork for independence and the pivotal political transition of 1956.

His close associations with two of the island’s leading Buddhist schools—Ânanda and Nâlanda—during his formative years highlight his significant influence. While teaching at Ânanda, he briefly learned Pâli at Vidyodaya Pirivena, showcasing his multifaceted engagement in the revival of the twentieth century. Importantly, his vision of mandating both Sinhala and Tamil in schools while maintaining English as a secondary language remains relevant. Such a constructive linguistic policy has the potential to foster ethnic harmony and mutual understanding, paving the way for a more unified Sri Lankan society by 2050.

However, the book could benefit from a deeper exploration of Malalasekera’s connections with the scholars of the Pali Text Society and his doctoral supervisor at SOAS University of London. Connections to the influential scholarly monastic figures—Sûriyagoda Sumangala (1879–1939) and Rambukwelle Siddhârtha (1889–1941) from Ceylon University College (1921–1943) should be further examined, as they could provide invaluable insights into two decades of Sinhala, Pali, and Sanskrit studies in Ceylon. We look forward to the author’s future research on Malalasekera’s relationships with A.P. de Zoysa and E.W. Adikaram. Wetara’s groundbreaking research successfully reintroduces Malalasekera as a formidable scholar in Sri Lankan Buddhism during the twentieth century, paving the way for renewed interest in his contributions.
