Brain-drain reality check: Fighting the wrong battle

How institutional misunderstanding of professional migration undermines effective policy responses

At recent forums, heads of Sri Lanka’s major research institutions and the Secretary of the Ministry of Science and Technology have sounded urgent alarms about the country’s “brain drain crisis.” Their diagnosis: Professional migration is devastating the economy. Their prescription: More research grants and making Sri Lanka “more conducive” to retain talent.

But this institutional narrative crumbles when confronted with empirical evidence and the actual motivations driving professional migration. The result is policy myopia; a short-sighted approach to policymaking, where decision-makers focus on immediate or short-term goals without adequately considering long-term consequences, broader systemic impacts, or the complexity of the issues involved. This approach not only misses the real dynamics at play but forecloses strategic opportunities that countries like India, China, and Ireland have successfully exploited.

Recent econometric research (a working paper) analysing 25 years of Sri Lankan migration data (1999-2023) reveals a striking paradox (Figure 1). This finding aligns with several global evidence which consistently shows that the macroeconomic consequences of skilled migration are modest and highly context-dependent.

The reason? Remittance flows and diaspora contributions systematically offset productivity losses. In 2023, Sri Lankan migrants remitted nearly USD 6 billion—a figure that dwarfs calculated productivity losses from professional emigration.

The institutional claim that professionals migrate because Sri Lanka is “not conducive” collapses when confronted with actual migrant motivations revealed through systematic interviews:

Educational Investment : Parents consistently cite children’s education as the primary driver. A medical officer leaving for Australia explained: “I want my daughter to access world-class universities without ultra-competitive local entrance exams. She can pursue marine biology—a field that barely exists here.” Research grants cannot compete with global educational opportunities.

Professional Development : Engineers seek exposure to projects impossible in Sri Lanka’s limited market. “I wanted to work on renewable energy infrastructure worth billions,” noted one departing civil engineer. “The largest project I could access here was maybe Rs. 300 million ($1 million).” Similarly, academics pursue PhD opportunities in fields that don’t exist in any Sri Lankan university.

Engineers consistently mention exposure to cutting-edge technology and project scales impossible in Sri Lanka. “I wanted to work on renewable energy infrastructure projects worth billions,” noted a civil engineer now in Dubai. “The largest project I could access here was maybe $50 million.”

Similarly, academics seek PhD opportunities and research environments that dwarf anything available domestically. A departing lecturer explained: “I can complete my doctorate at Cambridge in computational neuroscience—a field that doesn’t exist in any Sri Lankan university. How is that about ‘conduciveness’?”

Pragmatic Life Planning : Perhaps most revealing are the pragmatic considerations that institutional leaders prefer to ignore:

Passport Power : A significant number seek dual citizenship specifically for travel freedom. “With an Australian passport, I can travel to 185 countries visa-free. With Sri Lankan citizenship alone, it’s maybe 10,” explained a departing IT professional. Research grants don’t address this reality.

Healthcare Security : Professionals in their 40s and 50s increasingly cite access to advanced medical treatment as they age. “If I develop cancer at 65, I want access to the best oncology centres globally. That requires residency rights abroad,” noted a departing accountant.

Retirement Planning : Many professionals view migration as retirement security. “My superannuation in Sydney will be worth more than my entire EPF and career savings combined,” calculated a departing engineer.

Economic Mobility : The wealth accumulation differential remains stark. A nurse in the UK can purchase property within 3-5 years that would take 25-30 years to afford in Colombo on local salaries.

These represent rational life planning decisions, not character deficiencies or lack of patriotism.

The officials’ analytical approach reveals concerning flaws. Comparing percentages with dollar amounts, ignoring remittance flows, and dismissing international research on brain circulation demonstrates troubling disconnection from evidence-based policymaking.

At a deeper level, their analysis is shaped by what’s called “institutional framing bias”—this means they automatically treat professional migration as a total loss for the country, without considering any possible benefits. This kind of thinking leads to what economists refer to as a “discourse-reality gap”: a mismatch between how the issue is talked about and what’s actually happening. As a result, it becomes harder to develop smart, forward-looking policies.

Many analyses of professional migration are shaped by what’s known as “institutional framing bias”—a tendency to view the departure of skilled workers as a total national loss, without considering any potential benefits such as remittances, knowledge exchange, or global networks. This narrow framing leads to what economists call a “discourse-reality gap”: a disconnect between how the issue is discussed and what is actually happening on the ground.

Moreover, institutional leaders fundamentally mischaracterise the economics by treating education and training expenses, along with infrastructure investments, as recoverable losses when professionals serve here. These represent sunk costs—expenses already incurred regardless of future migration decisions. The infrastructure remains, serving other professionals and students; the educational capacity continues operating.

The marginal economic contribution of retaining a specific professional—through taxes and direct service provision—often proves modest compared to alternative contributions through remittances and diaspora investment. A migrant doctor may contribute more to Sri Lanka’s economy annually through remittances than through domestic tax payments and rural healthcare services.

Treating sunk costs as recoverable losses represents elementary economic confusion that distorts cost-benefit analysis and leads to misguided policy responses focused on impossible ‘recovery’ rather than strategic optimization of actual economic flows.

The proposed solution—more research grants—reflects profound misunderstanding of migration drivers. Against 10-15x salary differentials, superior working conditions, and access to cutting-edge infrastructure, modest research grants function as token gestures rather than serious retention strategies.

This approach ignores the scale mismatch: individual professionals can earn more in annual salary increases abroad than entire institutional research budgets provide domestically. Token allocations cannot compete with structural opportunity differentials.

More fundamentally, institutional leaders misrepresent basic economic principles when calculating migration “costs.” They routinely include education and training expenses, infrastructure investments, and institutional capacity building as recoverable losses if professionals emigrate.

This represents a fundamental confusion between sunk costs and opportunity costs. Education expenses incurred training a doctor or engineer are sunk costs—already spent regardless of future migration decisions. Similarly, university infrastructure, hospital equipment, and research facilities represent fixed costs that continue serving remaining populations whether specific individuals migrate or not.

The economic reality is stark: keeping a professional domestically might generate modest tax revenue and direct service provision, but these marginal benefits often pale compared to remittance contributions and diaspora investment flows. A migrant doctor might contribute more to Sri Lanka’s economy through annual remittances than through domestic tax payments and public service provision.

Treating sunk costs as recoverable losses fundamentally misrepresents economic reality and leads to misguided policy responses that ignore actual cost-benefit calculations.

Contemporary migration research reveals that skilled professionals increasingly operate through circulation rather than permanent departure. Many migrate with 15–20-year strategic plans including eventual return with enhanced capabilities. Digital connectivity enables continuous engagement despite physical absence—maintaining research collaborations, mentorship networks, and institutional linkages.

This suggests migration can function as strategic human capital internationalisation rather than permanent loss. Countries like India leveraged IT professional mobility to build global networks that subsequently drove domestic technology sector growth. China’s return migration programmes converted temporary departures into permanent competitive advantages.

Sri Lanka’s institutional discourse, however, remains trapped in binary thinking: Migration as either absolute loss to be prevented or unavoidable problem to be endured. This perspective forecloses sophisticated strategies that could convert migration from net cost to net benefit.

Rather than futile prevention efforts, effective policy would be structured temporary migration pathways while maintaining diaspora engagement through digital platforms and professional networks. Need to recognise different professional categories have distinct migration patterns and impact mechanisms requiring tailored responses. Need to focus on governance and systemic improvements rather than cosmetic funding increases that fail to address fundamental structural constraints.

Most importantly, Embrace Brain Circulation: Develop return incentives and project-based collaboration mechanisms that harness internationally acquired expertise without requiring permanent repatriation.

The officials’ narrative also fails to explain documented patterns of return migration, however modest. If Sri Lanka were simply “unconducive,” why do some professionals return? The evidence suggests complex decision-making involving life-cycle considerations, family obligations, strategic career planning, and maybe some flavour of patriotic motives that defies simplistic explanations.

This reverse flow, combined with continuous diaspora engagement, indicates migration operates through more sophisticated mechanisms than institutional leaders acknowledge.

The empirical evidence suggests Sri Lankan institutional leaders are addressing 20th-century problems with 19th-century understanding. Professional migration in the digital age operates through circulation mechanisms that can enhance rather than diminish long-term development prospects—when properly managed.

The choice is not between retaining all professionals or losing them forever. The choice is between strategic optimisation of human capital mobility or continued policy myopia that forecloses development opportunities.

Research grants and vague “conduciveness” improvements cannot compete with global opportunity differentials, legitimate family aspirations, and rational life planning decisions. Recognising this reality is the first step toward developing policy responses appropriate to contemporary migration dynamics.

Sri Lanka’s professionals will continue to migrate regardless of institutional pronouncements. Whether the country converts this reality into development advantage depends on abandoning failed prevention strategies and embracing evidence-based policy innovation.

The institutional leaders’ current approach represents not just policy failure, but strategic opportunity cost that Sri Lanka can ill afford.
