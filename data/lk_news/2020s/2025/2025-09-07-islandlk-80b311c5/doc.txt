Kapruka’s platform pivot powers 94% operating profit surge

Kapruka Holdings PLC is reaping the rewards of a strategic shift from traditional e-commerce to a capital-light platform model. The company reported a striking 94% year-on-year improvement in operating performance for its latest quarter, driven by the accelerating momentum of its Kapruka Partner Central initiative.

This platform transformation is moving Kapruka beyond an inventory-led retailer to an ecosystem orchestrator. By onboarding major Sri Lankan brands onto a shared infrastructure of tools, logistics, and service agreements, Kapruka has expanded its product selection without the proportional working-capital demands. This strategy enhanced unit economics, contributing to a 14% rise in revenue to LKR 448.52 million and a 30% jump in gross profit.

“Partner Central is transforming Kapruka into an orchestrator, unlocking more choice for customers, better economics for brands, and a more scalable business,” said Chairman and CEO Dulith Herath. The results underscore how a focused platform strategy can build a more resilient and deeply networked e-commerce business, positioning Kapruka at the heart of Sri Lanka’s digital economy.
