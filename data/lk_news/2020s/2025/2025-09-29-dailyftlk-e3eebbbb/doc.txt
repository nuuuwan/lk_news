Justice delayed and institutional credibility: Lessons from Easter Sunday case

Justice delayed has not only compounded victims’ suffering but has also damaged institutional credibility

To analyse the justice delays and inconsistencies following the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks, and to propose policy measures to strengthen the rule of law, enhance prosecutorial and judicial independence, and restore public trust in Sri Lanka’s criminal justice system.

The Easter Sunday terrorist attacks in April 2019 killed over 260 people and injured hundreds.

Inconsistencies in prosecutorial decisions by the Attorney General’s Department, coupled with judicial delays, have raised questions about political interference, institutional weakness, and erosion of public trust.

This case has become a litmus test for the credibility of Sri Lanka’s criminal justice system.

Justice must be equal, timely, and free from political influence.

Prolonged delays have weakened the principle of equality before the law.

Investigations identified key suspects, but allegations of selective targeting and poor evidence management persist.

The AG’s independence is questioned due to inconsistent decisions on suspects.

Perception of judicial reluctance in politically sensitive cases undermines independence.

Establish special terrorism and complex crimes courts with statutory timelines.

Introduce an independent appointments and oversight process for senior AG officials.

Create a Truth and Accountability Commission to complement criminal trials.

Strengthen victim-centred justice measures: legal aid, psychological support, and participation rights in proceedings.

A fast, fair, and transparent justice process is essential to uphold the rule of law.

The Easter Sunday case demonstrates a critical breakdown in the alignment of law enforcement, prosecution, and judiciary. Justice delayed has not only compounded victims’ suffering but has also damaged institutional credibility. Reform is urgent: a fast, fair, and transparent justice process is essential to uphold the rule of law, restore public trust, and ensure democratic stability. Failure to act decisively will leave the Easter Sunday tragedy remembered not only as an act of terror but as a failure of justice in Sri Lanka
