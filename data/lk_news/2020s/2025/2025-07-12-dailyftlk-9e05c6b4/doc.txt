Dialog Enterprise, the corporate ICT solutions arm of Dialog Axiata, continues to drive innovation in Sri Lanka’s business landscape by introducing technology solutions that go beyond traditional applications. In a pioneering move, Dialog Enterprise has deployed an adaptive video surveillance solution for Jubilant FoodWorks Lanka Ltd., the exclusive operator of Domino’s Pizza in Sri Lanka, to enhance customer service quality and operational efficiency.

While video surveillance is commonly associated with physical security, loss prevention, and incident investigations, Jubilant FoodWorks Lanka has leveraged this technology in an innovative way to improve customer experience and streamline service delivery at Domino’s Pizza Sri Lanka outlets. This deployment marks a significant shift in how businesses can utilise video surveillance systems to optimise and streamline operations.

The solution offers real-time, centralised monitoring in video and audio along with operational insights, allowing Domino’s Pizza Sri Lanka outlets to maintain high service standards, reduce wait times, and ensure order accuracy. By analysing customer greeting and handling, queue management, and kitchen operations, Jubilant FoodWorks Lanka can make informed decisions that enhance both efficiency and customer satisfaction.

“Delivering fast, high-quality service is at the heart of our operations at Domino’s Pizza Sri Lanka,” said Jubilant FoodWorks Lanka IT Head Eranga Perera. “With Dialog Enterprise’s video surveillance solution, we now have enhanced visibility into our customer service and operations, allowing us to proactively manage customer flow, improve response times, and elevate the overall dining experience.”

The system enables monitoring of staff performance, peak-hour demand trends, and service bottlenecks, allowing management to refine workflows, allocate resources more efficiently, and introduce service enhancements tailored to customer expectations.

“Technology should not only tackle challenges but also create new opportunities for businesses,” said Navin Pieris, Group Chief Officer of Dialog Enterprise. “This deployment with Jubilant FoodWorks Lanka demonstrates how a well-implemented video surveillance solution can go beyond traditional physical security, helping businesses elevate customer experiences and operational excellence. By collaborating with leading enterprises, we continue to introduce tailored solutions that empower businesses to thrive in a dynamic market.” Beyond restaurant chains, this innovative application of video surveillance has the potential to transform customer service across retail, hospitality, and service industries, where real-time operational insights can enhance customer interactions and business performance. Through strategic partnerships and cutting-edge solutions, Dialog Enterprise reaffirms its commitment to supporting Sri Lankan businesses with technology-driven innovations. By fine-tuning surveillance systems to meet specific operational needs, businesses can unlock new efficiencies, drive superior customer experiences, and stay ahead in an increasingly competitive landscape.
