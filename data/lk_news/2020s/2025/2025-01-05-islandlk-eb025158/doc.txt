IIHS launches new degree programs to empower healthcare professionals

The International Institute of Health Sciences (IIHS)has introduced a range of new degree courses for health professionals, including nurses and midwives, said a release.

These programmes, in partnership with Asia e University in Malaysia, offer locally and internationally recognized qualifications in fields such as nursing, pharmaceuticals, public health, dental therapy, and food and environmental science.

Dr. Kithsiri Edirisinghe, the CEO/Founder – IIHS, said: “Sri Lanka’s education system has unique challenges, primarily due to funding discrepancies. This has led to a restrictive environment, especially for those in healthcare, where there is often a lack of inclusivity,” further he explains. “Historically, there has been limited inclusion for healthcare professionals outside of the medical doctor field. While doctors have enjoyed some inclusion, nurses, midwives, public health inspectors (PHIs), dispensers, and mature nurses were often overlooked. We were the first to initiate inclusion by introducing bachelor’s, master’s, and now even doctorate programmes in nursing.”
