Sri Lanka to use Rs1bn of OPEC fund loan to improve Embilipitiya road

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will use part of a 40 million dollar loan from the OPEC Fund for International Development to improve a 9.62 km section of the Embilipitiya-Panamura-Buluthota road, minister Nalinda Jayatissa said.

“There is a balance of about Rs. 1,000 million of that loan, and it is planned to use that money and government funds to improve the 9.62 km section of the currently dilapidated Embilipitiya-Panamura-Buluthota road (B115) from Kolonna to Suriyakanda,” Jayatissa told reporters.

“This section of the road will provide access to several tourist attractions such as the Sinharaja Forest, Maduwanwela Walawwa, Waulpane, Gongala, Handapanagala, Buluthota waterfalls and Himidiri Pedesa, boosting tourism.”
