Rs 2,500M spent on expired reagents at NHSL: CIABOC informs MCPA of upcoming probe

The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) has informed the Medical and Civil Rights Professional Association of Doctors (MCPA) that it will launch an investigation into the alleged procurement of reagents worth Rs 2,500 million, most of which were reportedly expired.

According to informed sources, CIABOC, in a written communication earlier this month, confirmed its decision to proceed with the probe based on a complaint lodged by MCPA President Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa.

The complaint concerns the procurement and alleged misuse of reagents for the National Hospital, Colombo, over a prolonged period.

Sources said several allegations have been levelled against the current Health Secretary, the former Deputy Director General of the National Hospital, Colombo, specialist medical practitioners, and laboratory technicians. These include accusations of purchasing machinery and reagents exclusively from a single supplier.

Meanwhile, Dr. Sanjeewa has also lodged a complaint with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and recently expressed concern over delays in both investigations. The CID has begun recording preliminary evidence, while CIABOC has confirmed that inquiries will commence without further delay.
