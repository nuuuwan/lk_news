Sri Lanka Customs to release 506 disputed BYD EVs with bank guarantee

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Customs has undertaken to release 506 Chinese-made Electric Vehicles (EVs) which had been detained over false motor capacity declaration, sources said.

Sri Lanka’s authorized distributor of BYD vehicles John Keells CG Auto (Pvt) Ltd (JKCG) has sought a court decision to get thousands of detained BYD vehicles released in a dispute over motor capacity.

Under the court order customs will release 506 BYD vehicles under a bank guarantee.

The court case on the next set of vehicles detained by the Customs will be taken up next week.

The Customs detained about 2,000 more Chinese-made BYD electric vehicles arriving on the island over the declaration of motor capacity which is used to calculate taxes.

It released about 1,000 vehicles last month before the latest batch.

The first detentions involved Atto 3 BYD vehicles with a declared motor of 100 kiloWatts following a complaint that the cars are usually produced with a 150kW motor, which attracts a higher rate of duty in Sri Lanka.

The excise for a 100 kW motor vehicle is 2.4 million rupees, but this rises to about 5.4 million rupees for a 150 KW vehicle.

Sri Lanka authorities had taken six BYD vehicles for motor capacity testing both locally and internationally before releasing to ascertain the motor, sources said.

Electric cars use complex drivetrains, which may involve motors (so-called firmware limited), electronic control units (ECUs), a battery management system, to provide specific driving characteristics and transmit power to wheels.

Other EV manufacturers are also selling models with manufacturer rated motors in foreign and local markets.

Sri Lanka has already imported around over 4,500 BYD vehicles including the detained vehicles.
