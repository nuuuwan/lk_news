Monash–UCL partnership strengthens Australia–Sri Lanka education investment ties

Australia’s High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Matthew Duckworth, highlighted the economic and strategic significance of education as a driver of bilateral relations between Australia and Sri Lanka, highlighting the Monash–UCL partnership as a model of transnational collaboration that continues to power Sri Lanka’s human capital development.

Speaking at the 10th Anniversary and Alumni Reunion of Monash College and the University College of Lanka (UCL) on Wednesday at the City of Dreams in Colombo, Duckworth described the decade-long alliance as “a real achievement worth recognising and celebrating,” noting that it has enabled hundreds of Sri Lankan students to access globally recognised Australian degrees without leaving home.

“Education is one of the most powerful and enduring links between Australia and Sri Lanka, he said, adding that “this partnership is helping to build the skills and capabilities that will define Sri Lanka’s future economy.”

He revealed that more than 2,500 Sri Lankans have graduated from Monash University, with the majority living and working in Sri Lanka across vital sectors such as business, health, technology, and education. “Every graduate who applies their expertise here strengthens the nation’s workforce and inspires others to do the same, Duckworth said.

Pointing to the broader economic dimension, the High Commissioner said Australia’s education sector remains a cornerstone of bilateral engagement, contributing not only to trade and investment but also to Sri Lanka’s long-term development goals. He also lauded the high academic standards of UCL students, who “consistently achieve first-year results that rival and surpass those of their peers in Australia.”

Monash College CEO and Monash University Vice President Fabian Marrone said education partnerships like Monash–UCL represent “a blueprint for sustainable skills development in the Indo-Pacific.”

“Monash is Australia’s largest university — and truly the university of the Indo-Pacific, Marrone said. “This partnership with UCL reflects our shared commitment to expanding access to world-class education and driving positive economic and social outcomes in Sri Lanka.”

UCL Director Steven Enderby emphasised that Sri Lanka’s next phase of growth depends on harnessing its educated diaspora and alumni networks.

“If we are truly going to build a nation, we need our best and brightest to reinvest their knowledge and experience here, Enderby said. “The Monash–UCL partnership has proven that transnational education can be more than an academic exercise — it’s an economic strategy.”

Australia’s education relationship with Sri Lanka extends back to the Colombo Plan of the 1950s, under which thousands of Sri Lankans studied in Australian institutions and returned to contribute locally. Today, more than 20,000 Sri Lankan students are enrolled annually in Australian universities, making education one of the most dynamic elements of the bilateral economic relationship.
