Asia Cup Drama: Pakistan Arrives Late, Still Crushes UAE

COLOMBO (News 1st); Pakistan secured a 41-run victory over the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in a tense Asia Cup T20 match held in Dubai, despite a delayed start and off-field controversy.

The match began an hour late due to Pakistan’s team arriving late at the stadium.

Reports suggest the delay stemmed from tensions following a controversial incident during the earlier India-Pakistan clash.

Allegedly, match referee Andy Pycroft instructed both captains not to shake hands during the toss, citing diplomatic sensitivities, which led to backlash from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).

The PCB has since requested Pycroft’s removal from the tournament.

Despite the rocky start, UAE won the toss and opted to bowl first.

Pakistan’s innings saw early setbacks, losing two wickets for just 9 runs.

However, Fakhar Zaman stabilized the innings with a half-century, while Shaheen Shah Afridi remained unbeaten on 29.

Pakistan posted a total of 146 runs for 9 wickets in their 20 overs.

Junaid Siddique was the standout bowler for UAE, claiming 4 wickets.

Rahul Chopra top-scored with 35 runs, but seven other batters failed to reach double digits.

Pakistan’s bowling attack, led by Afridi, Haris Rauf, and Abrar Ahmed — each taking two wickets — restricted UAE to 105 runs in 17.4 overs, sealing a comfortable win.
