Sri Lanka Police in process to bring back criminals living abroad

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka Police is in the process of bringing back criminals who are living in other countries in a move to curb crimes, newly appointed Police Spokesman K.B. Manathunga said.

“We have started a gradual process to tackle crime in the country. We are also in the process of bringing back criminals who are in foreign countries. We are in the process of issuing red notices and using bilateral agreements for this,” Manathunga told reporters at a media briefing on Friday (03) in Colombo.

He said the Police want to use President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s Clean Sri Lanka concept to improve implementation of the country’s rule of law with the participation of people,

His statement comes after media reports of police evicting street vendors under Clean Sri Lanka, an ambitious move by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to systematically change the country’s existing governance.

“Under Clean Sri Lanka we have been assigned to establish the rule of law in the country or create an ethical and disciplined generation in the country. We will be getting public participation in this. We have given this to a few divisions,” he said.

“We have launched the e-traffic app to find out traffic violations with the help of the public. We will be establishing a special counter at the police to receive the public complaints and act on them.”

“We have established committees at provincial and divisional level. They will be handling issues particularly related to those areas.” (Colombo/January 03/2025)
