Cabinet directs to gazette and table revised Social Security Contribution Levy Bill for Parliament approval

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the publication of the amended Social Security Contribution Levy (Amendments) Act in the Government gazette, following clearance from the Attorney General, before submitting it to Parliament for approval.

The revised draft Bill, prepared by the Legal Draftsman, incorporates changes proposed in the 2025 Budget aimed at updating and refining the country’s social security tax framework.

“Key amendments cover several sectors,” Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said at the weekly post-Cabinet media briefing yesterday.

He said the amendments include; machinery imported or purchased locally for generating electricity, the wholesale and retail trade of petrol, diesel, or kerosene, related services provided by container terminal operators in international transport, and exemptions from the contribution tax for financial services provided by any person or institution carrying on a financial services business in Sri Lanka.

The proposal to this effect submitted by President Anura Kumara Disanayake in his capacity as the Finance, Planning and Economic Development Minister was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
