Sri Lanka’s women entrepreneurs lack networking opportunities: EDB

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s women entrepreneurs lack networking opportunities with industry leaders, the country’s Export Development Board (EDB) has said.

The trade body recently conducted a networking and knowledge sharing session for women entrepreneurs registered under the Women Entrepreneurship Development Program.

“The event addressed one of the key barriers faced by women entrepreneurs, lack of networking opportunities with industry leaders,” the EDB said.

This session brought together 50 women entrepreneurs, including SME direct exporters and indirect exporters, along with leading exporters and academics.

The event “fostered connections, facilitated knowledge sharing, and encouraged collaboration to help women entrepreneurs navigate international markets,” and featured a panel of speakers who shared their expertise on various topics critical to succeeding in the global marketplace, the trade body said.

These included topics: strategies to incorporate sustainability into export operations, examples of thriving in competitive international markets, the importance of understanding and mitigating legal risks in labor management, the nuances of cultural differences and their impact on international negotiations, entering and excelling in challenging markets.

The session enabled women entrepreneurs to expand their networks and gain insights from industry leaders. (Colombo/Jan1/2025)
