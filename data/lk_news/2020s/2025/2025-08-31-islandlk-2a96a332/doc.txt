DIMO unveils Tata passenger vehicle showroom at Altair Colombo

DIMO, the only authorized distributor for Tata Motors in Sri Lanka, unveiled its latest flagship Tata Passenger Vehicle (PV) showroom at Altair Colombo. The opening of this premium facility comes as part of DIMO’s efforts to expand its Tata showroom network in response to the overwhelming reception of the recently launched Tata Passenger Vehicle Range, further enhancing customer accessibility and convenience in the heart of Colombo.

Offering customers a premium, centrally located destination to experience the full Tata passenger vehicle range, the new flagship showroom at Altair Colombo enhances accessibility while elevating the brand experience, making Tata Passenger vehicles more visible and convenient for urban customers.

This latest addition follows a series of new openings in Kurunegala, Galle, and Minneriya, locations strategically selected to improve geographic reach and customer convenience.

Each location was identified based on accessibility and market potential, with Colombo serving as the premium central hub, while regional cities like Kurunegala and Galle provide easier access for customers from surrounding districts.
