India may get lower than Sr Lanka Trump tariff, JAAF warns

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka should try to further negotiate down a tariff rate from the United States, after an initial 44 percent rate was brought down to 30 percent, a top apparel export body says.

JAAF said that Vietnam has negotiated its rate down to 20 percent. Vietnam however has offered duty free entry and Bangladesh has started talks to reduce its 35 percent rate.

India was only given a 26 percent rate originally, compared to Sri Lanka’s 44 percent.

“India’s position remains under discussion, but early signals suggest it may receive a more favorable rate than Sri Lanka,” JAAF said.

“In all likelihood Cambodia, another competitor with a tariff rate marginally higher than Sri Lanka will also be negotiating for a reduction.”

Sri Lanka government negotiators said they plan to continue talks with the US.

The announcement of a 30% reciprocal tariff by the U.S., scheduled to take effect from 1st August 2025, has raised significant concern within Sri Lanka’s apparel industry. As one of the country’s largest export earners, the sector relies heavily on access to the U.S. market, and such a steep increase threatens to erode competitiveness, particularly when compared to regional peers.

JAAF notes that Vietnam has already concluded its negotiations and now faces a 20% tariff, while Bangladesh, though at 35%, has already begun negotiations with the U.S. to secure a reduction.

India’s position remains under discussion, but early signals suggest it may receive a more favorable rate than Sri Lanka. In all likelihood Cambodia, another competitor with a tariff rate marginally higher than Sri Lanka will also be negotiating for a reduction.

“If the 30% tariff stands, we risk seeing a migration of U.S. buyers to lower-tariff countries,” JAAF warned. “We strongly urge the Government to continue active engagement with the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to secure a better deal for Sri Lanka.”

The reduction from 44 to 30% is a recognition of the good faith with which Sri Lanka has been having its dialogue with USTR and JAAF is encouraged by the Government’s comments today indicating that negotiations with USTR will continue with a sense of urgency ahead of the 1st August deadline when the 30% will become effective.

JAAF further stressed that a diplomatic resolution is vital to safeguarding jobs, sustaining market share, and reinforcing Sri Lanka’s position as a trusted partner in global apparel supply chains.
