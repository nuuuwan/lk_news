Parliament complex sees major facelift after four decades

Extensive renovations of the Parliament of Sri Lanka complex have recently begun under Cabinet approval. These renovations are taking place after more than 42 years, a Parliament Secretariat statement said.

Work is currently underway to remove the soil layer on the concrete roof terrace of the Parliamentary complex and carry out repairs. In addition, renovations are being done to the roof gutters, copper door, Parliament Medical Centre, washrooms, and Membersâ€™ Dressing Room.

Previously, minor maintenance work of the Parliamentary complex was carried out by the Engineering Department. However, the large-scale renovations are being carried out with the labour contribution of the Sri Lankan Army.
