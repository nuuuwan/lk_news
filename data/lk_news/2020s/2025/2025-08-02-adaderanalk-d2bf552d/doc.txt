The Meteorology Department states that showers or thundershowers will occur at several places in the Northern, North-Central, Uva, Eastern, Central, and Sabaragamuwa provinces, and in the Kurunegala and Hambantota districts after 1:00 p.m.

Fairly heavy falls above 75 mm are likely at some places in these areas, the statement said.
