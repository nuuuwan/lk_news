Sri Lanka SEC unveils capital market reform plan, eyes demutualisation of CSE

ECONOMYNEXT – The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of Sri Lanka has presented its 12-step capital market reform agenda, which includes the demutualisation of the Colombo Stock Exchange.

“This strategic framework comprises of 12 meaningful initiatives, including the demutualisation of the Colombo Stock Exchange, expansion of the corporate debt and collective investment schemes industry, the introduction of new financial instruments, and the establishment of a multi-asset class derivatives exchange,” Hareendra Dissabandara, SEC Chairman said.

“We must have a vibrant capital market for the next generation.”

“Not just shares and bonds, we should be able to deal with digital assets. People are more into crypto currency now, so we must facilitate that area.”

Over the next decade the SEC’s strategy will be driven by the twelve key developmental and regulatory priorities, which aim to deliver three core outcomes, he said;

– To foster continuous innovation in the capital market to ensure its relevance and responsiveness to the evolving needs of the economy and investors.

– To enhance infrastructure and services to be more efficient, accessible and reliable.

– To develop a diverse market ecosystem that strengthens the competitiveness and resilience of the overall Capital Market

Capital market participations was very low, he said, attracting less than 1 percent, Dissabandara said. “Of 22 million there are only varying number of 9,000 to 60,000 people in the market.”

He said market literacy was very low and they expect to change this. (Colombo/Sep25/2025)
