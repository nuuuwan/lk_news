The prestigious accolade highlights the resort’s pioneering achievements in sustainable hospitality and reinforces its leadership role in shaping the future of tourism in Sri Lanka and the wider region.

The International Centre for Responsible Tourism (ICRT) Awards are regarded as one of the region’s foremost platforms for recognising excellence in sustainable practices. Each year, they honour organisations that demonstrate innovation, accountability, and long-term commitment to responsible tourism. Winning the Gold Award under the Climate Adaptation and Resilience category places Heritance Kandalama among the foremost champions of sustainability in the Indian subcontinent and, as a Gold recipient, the resort is eligible to stand at the Global Responsible Tourism Awards, further elevating its influence on an international stage.

Heritance Kandalama has long been celebrated as a benchmark for eco-conscious tourism. Designed by the renowned architect Geoffrey Bawa, the hotel is integrated seamlessly into its natural surroundings, embodying the principle that nature and design should complement each other. Since its inception, the property has introduced innovative sustainability initiatives ranging from advanced waste management and renewable energy use to biodiversity preservation and water conservation.

Stasshani Jayawardena, Chairperson of Aitken Spence Hotel Holdings PLC stated: “Receiving the prestigious Gold Award is a powerful affirmation of our ethos; that sustainability is not an obligation, but a profound responsibility. This recognition, granted for our measurable progress in decarbonising tourism and developing adaptive solutions – confirms that we are on the right path and reaffirms our resolve, as we continue to shape the future of accountable tourism.”

Over the decades, Heritance Kandalama has been admired for its environmental commitment. The resort is home to Sri Lanka’s longest continually certified ISO 14001 environmental management system, affirming its ongoing commitment to preserving the environment through the highest adherence produce to international standards. In addition to a multitude of awards and certifications, it holds the esteemed Travelife Gold Certification for Accommodation, recognised by the Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC).

Covering an expansive 211-acre eco-forest reserve, the resort actively protects the 128 species of native flora, as well as a vibrant wildlife population, including 183 bird species, 64 butterfly species, and numerous mammals and reptiles, all thriving in the sanctuary it provides. Complementing its ecological stewardship, Heritance Kandalama is also an essential contributor to the local community, sourcing local produce and employing over 60% of its exceptional team from within a 20-kilometer radius.

Beyond environmental accolades, Heritance Kandalama has made significant contributions to the social and cultural fabric of its surrounding communities. By creating employment opportunities, empowering local suppliers, and supporting cultural heritage, the resort ensures that its success benefits people as much as it protects nature. These initiatives reflect the very values that the ICRT Awards were established to promote; a model of tourism that is inclusive, ethical, and sustainable.

This Gold Award not only recognises Heritance Kandalama’s long-standing achievements but also affirms its continued commitment to leading the region in responsible tourism. It underscores the resort’s vision of aligning world-class hospitality with social responsibility and environmental stewardship, inspiring both travellers and industry peers.
