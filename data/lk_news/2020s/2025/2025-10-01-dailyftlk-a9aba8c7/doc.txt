Shashindra Rajapaksa further remanded

The Colombo Magistrateâ€™s Court yesterday ordered to further remand former State Minister Shashindra Rajapaksa, who is currently in custody till 14 October.

The order was made by Colombo Chief Magistrate Asanga S. Bodaragama.

Rajapaksa was arrested over allegations that he used his official position to unlawfully secure compensation for an unauthorised property damaged during the 2022 public uprising. The compensation claim, initially rejected, involved property not legally entitled to such payment.
