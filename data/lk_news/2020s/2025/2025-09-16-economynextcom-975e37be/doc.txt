Sri Lanka manufacturing expands at slower rate in August 2025: PMI

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s manufacturing sector expanded at a slower rate to 55.2 in August, compared to 62.2 in July, according to a Purchasing Managers Index compiled by the central bank.

All sub-indices registered lower rates of expansion compared to the previous month.

The growth in the New Orders and Production sub-indices were supported by strong performances in the food and beverages manufacturing sector, CBSL said.

The Employment sub-index remained in the positive territory during August, indicating favourable Employment conditions.

However, Suppliers’ Delivery Time continued to lengthen during the month; “with some respondents reported delays in international shipping”.

“Manufacturing activities over the next three months remain positive, largely underpinned by the anticipated seasonal demand towards the year end.” (Colombo/Sep16/2025)
