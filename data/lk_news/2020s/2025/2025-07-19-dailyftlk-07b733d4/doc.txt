Court rejects Rajitha’s anticipatory bail application

Colombo Chief Magistrate Thanuja Lakmali Jayatunga yesterday rejected the anticipatory bail application filed by former Minister Rajitha Senaratne.

On 14 July, Senaratne’s Attorney’s filed an anticipatory bail application before the Colombo Magistrate’s Court, seeking release in anticipation of a possible arrest by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC).

The officials of the Bribery Commission had previously informed the Court that the former Minister is expected to be taken into custody in connection with the alleged financial loss of Rs. 26.2 million to the Government, said to have resulted from awarding a sand excavation project at the Kirinda Fisheries Harbour to a Korean company.

This had been stated by officials of the Bribery Commission when the former Ceylon Fisheries Harbour Corporation (CFHC) Chairman Upali Liyanage, who was arrested on corruption charges, was produced before the Court on 27 June.
