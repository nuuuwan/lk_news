SC grants leave to proceed in case challenging gender-based recruitment for Station Master posts

The Supreme Court yesterday granted leave to proceed with a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed by two women, challenging the Sri Lanka Railway Department’s decision to limit applications for Station Master positions to male candidates only.

Leave to proceed was granted in terms of Articles 12(1), 12(2), and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution by a three-judge bench comprising Justices A.H.M.D. Nawaz, Priyantha Fernando and Sampath Wijeratne.

Petitioners Ayeshani Jayawardena and S. Vidusha are contesting the legality of a Gazette notification issued on 13 June 2025, which invited applications for 106 Station Master vacancies, but stipulated that only males were eligible.

Appearing for the petitioners, Counsel Nuwan Bopege argued that the discriminatory gender clause listed under “other qualifications” was unconstitutional and violated the petitioners’ rights under Articles 12(1), 12(2), and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution, which guarantee equality before the law, protection against gender-based discrimination and the freedom to engage in any lawful occupation.
