CEB union staff to call in sick on Thursday, Friday

The Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers’ Union (CEBEU) announced that its members will report sick leave on 17 and 18 September as part of an escalation in their trade union campaign against the Government’s plan to restructure the CEB.

The first stage of the work-to-rule campaign ended on Monday, with the second stage taking effect from yesterday. Under this phase, employees will withdraw from committee work, including tender boards, and limit their participation to core job functions.

A protest campaign is also scheduled to take place during the two days of coordinated sick leave.

The union has maintained that while industrial action will intensify, office closures and other operational disruptions are not anticipated.
