Is Japan ready for its first female PM?

Japan has never confronted the raw contradiction inherent in its postwar democracy: a nation reconstructed from devastation, yet shackled by entrenched hierarchies that dictate who may wield authority. The first week of next month, however, a singular possibility emerges. Sanae Takaichi, former economic security minister and unflinching conservative, positions herself as the foremost contender to assume the premiership, an office long monopolised by men. Her candidacy is not merely symbolic; it exposes the fissures in Japan’s political system, its gender inequities, and the enduring influence of historical power brokers, while raising profound questions about legitimacy, merit, and risk in governance.

Takaichi’s ascent is neither conventional nor superficial. Born in 1961 in Nara Prefecture, she briefly explored entertainment before committing to political life. Her studies at Kobe University were complemented by exposure to American legislative procedures as an aide in the U.S. House of Representatives—an experience that endowed her with strategic insight unusual among Japanese lawmakers. Entering the Diet in 1993, she quickly manoeuvred the LDP’s factional matrix, becoming a protégé of Shinzo Abe, whose influence and legacy continue to bolster her standing. This mentorship, combined with her skill at coalition-building within the party, positions her as a candidate with both institutional acumen and grassroots resonance.

Takaichi is resolute. She is an unapologetic nationalist, frequenting the Yasukuni Shrine and advocating constitutional revision to formally recognise the Self-Defense Forces. These positions signal loyalty to the LDP’s conservative base while simultaneously provoking unease in China and South Korea, for whom such gestures evoke historical trauma. Yet Takaichi’s platform is not monolithic. Recently, she has articulated policies addressing Japan’s persistent gender inequities: partial tax deductions for childcare, corporate incentives for in-house care, and advocacy around women’s health informed by her personal experience with menopause and caregiving responsibilities. In these measures, she manages the tension between ideological orthodoxy and pragmatic responsiveness.

Takaichi distinguishes herself as a fiscal dove, advocating government expenditure to counter inflationary pressures while signalling the possible necessity of issuing government bonds under exigent circumstances. Her public remarks last week, warning that reliance on tax revenue alone may be insufficient to combat rising consumer prices, reflect a willingness to confront Japan’s entrenched bureaucratic orthodoxy. Historically, such boldness echoes the fiscal interventions of the Abe administration, whose policies were partly facilitated by covert CIA funding and Cold War-era machinations to stabilise Japan against leftist influence.

Takaichi’s political biography is punctuated by moments that reveal both resilience and calculated audacity. In the 2024 LDP leadership contest, she narrowly lost to Shigeru Ishiba in a runoff, illustrating her capacity to command substantial support even in a field dominated by male elders. Her repeated candidacies reflect strategic patience and an understanding of the party’s factional undercurrents, where loyalty networks, not merely public opinion, determine outcomes. Unlike Shinjiro Koizumi, whose political capital derives from dynastic inheritance, Takaichi’s influence rests on cultivated alliances and personal reputation—a precarious but potentially liberating position in a system long dominated by hereditary claims.

The broader context magnifies the stakes. Japan continues to rank dismally on the World Economic Forum’s Gender Gap Index, placing 118th among 148 countries, with women representing only 15.7% of the lower house. No woman has ever held the prime ministership, the finance ministry, or the governorship of the Bank of Japan. Internationally, a female premier would alter perceptions of Japan’s modernity and commitment to inclusivity, but domestically, her tenure could be precarious. Scholars such as Hiroko Takeda of Nagoya University caution against the “glass cliff” phenomenon, where women ascend to leadership precisely during periods of instability, only to bear disproportionate blame for systemic failures. With the LDP weakened after consecutive electoral setbacks, the next prime minister will face a fractured legislature, rising inflation, and geopolitical tensions that demand deft negotiation with both domestic opposition and international actors.

Takaichi’s potential premiership would also engage the unresolved dialectic between conservatism and modernisation. Her hardline stances on nationalism and security are juxtaposed with nascent advocacy for gender-sensitive economic policies—tax breaks for childcare and protections for caregivers. This duality challenges simplistic classifications of her as merely reactionary or progressive; she embodies a calculated hybridity, presenting an image palatable to conservative party elders while cautiously courting broader urban and younger constituencies. Such strategic adaptability has precedents in Japan’s political history, where leaders like Hayashi and Motegi addressed factional rivalries and bureaucratic resistance. Yet Takaichi’s gender introduces an additional dimension of scrutiny, both domestic and international.

The historical resonance of her candidacy is equally compelling. Postwar Japan, emerging from the devastation of World War II, was shepherded into democracy under Allied supervision, with American authorities even influencing the structure of political parties and suppressing leftist movements—some through clandestine financial support for conservative actors. The LDP’s early hegemony owes, in part, to these interventions, which entrenched a culture of factionalism and male-dominated hierarchy that persists today. Takaichi’s rise, therefore, is not simply the ascension of a single politician; it is a confrontation with the enduring legacies of occupation-era manipulation, factional patronage, and institutional gender bias.

Furthermore, Takaichi’s personal narrative lends an uncommon dimension to her candidacy. Her experiences juggling professional obligations with caregiving responsibilities resonate with a substantial segment of Japanese society, particularly women who face structural impediments to career advancement.

By invoking her struggles with menopause and child-rearing, she frames policy debates in human terms, challenging the traditional detachment of Japanese policymaking from lived experience. In doing so, she redefines what leadership might entail in a society where policy and personal experience are often segregated.

Yet controversy is inseparable from possibility. Takaichi’s unapologetic nationalism and engagement with historically sensitive issues, such as Yasukuni visits and advocacy for Taiwan security partnerships, have drawn criticism from neighbouring states and some domestic moderates. Analysts note that any failure on her part could reinforce misogynistic narratives, portraying her tenure as a deterrent example rather than a step towards inclusivity. Conversely, a successful premiership would not merely be symbolic; it would recalibrate power dynamics within the LDP, potentially encouraging a generation of women to pursue political office in a system historically structured against them.

Ultimately, the question of whether Japan is prepared for a female prime minister transcends Takaichi herself. It interrogates the resilience of democratic institutions in a party-dominated polity, the elasticity of entrenched gender norms, and the capacity of voters and politicians alike to reconcile ideological conservatism with the exigencies of modern governance. Sanae Takaichi’s candidacy is at once emblematic and exceptional: emblematic of the LDP’s enduring factional machinery and exceptional for its potential to disrupt decades of patriarchal orthodoxy. Her rise is simultaneously a challenge to the established order, a reckoning with history, and a speculative exercise in political futurism. Will Japan finally elevate a woman to prime minister, or will entrenched norms keep Takaichi in the realm of “almosts”? We shall know in just a few days.
