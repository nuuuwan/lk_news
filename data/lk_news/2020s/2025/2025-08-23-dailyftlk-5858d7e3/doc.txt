BASL urges inclusion of Law in school curriculum

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) yesterday called on the Government to introduce Law as part of the national education curriculum, saying legal literacy is critical for civic consciousness and democratic participation.

In a letter addressed to Prime Minister and Education Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, the BASL welcomed the Ministry’s ongoing education reforms, saying the addition of legal studies would align Sri Lanka with international practices. “The subject of Law has been introduced to the school curriculum in many countries, reflecting the global understanding that law-related education is a fundamental building block of civic consciousness and democratic engagement,” the letter stated.

The BASL proposed that law be included as a compulsory component of primary education, while also being offered as an elective at the G.C.E. Advanced Level. The association is prepared to work with the Education Ministry and other relevant state institutions in designing and reviewing the curriculum to ensure “academic rigour and suitability to Sri Lanka’s legal and cultural context.”

The BASL said it looks forward to the Government’s favourable consideration of its proposal.
