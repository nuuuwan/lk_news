Sri Lankan ingenuity saves billions at Kelanitissa Power Plant

In a remarkable display of homegrown engineering prowess, the engineers of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) at the Kelanitissa Combined Cycle Power Station (KCCP) have achieved what international experts considered impossible. By successfully repairing a critical turbine rotor locally, the team not only averted an enormous foreign exchange outflow but also safeguarded national energy security at a crucial juncture.

At the heart of this achievement was the 110 MW gas turbine generator rotor, a vital component of the plant’s combined cycle system. When it developed a critical fault, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) ruled it beyond repair in Sri Lanka and insisted on complete replacement. The quoted price for a new rotor was an eye-watering Rs. 1.4 billion, excluding additional costs for replacement, installation, testing, and commissioning.

Even sending the rotor overseas for inspection would have meant removing 165 MW of capacity from the national grid for months—an alarming prospect, given the country’s already stretched electricity supply.

“The risks were enormous, but so were the stakes,” explained CEB Spokesman and Chief Engineer Eng. Dhammika Wimalaratne, who led the effort.

He told The Sunday Island: “If the Kelanitissa plant had gone offline for long, the impact on the grid and the economy would have been severe. We had to take a bold decision to attempt what many said could not be done in Sri Lanka.”

Kelanitissa Combined Cycle Power Station holds a unique place in Sri Lanka’s energy sector. It is the only power plant in the country that operates on naphtha, a byproduct of the local refinery. In addition, it ranks as the second-lowest-cost thermal power station after Norochcholai, producing electricity at just Rs. 33–36 per unit.

A prolonged shutdown at Kelanitissa would not only have destabilised the grid but also forced the CEB to rely more heavily on high-cost alternatives, increasing the financial burden on both the state and consumers.

“This plant is a backbone for low-cost electricity generation in Sri Lanka,” Eng. Wimalaratne noted. “We knew that allowing it to remain idle for months while waiting for an overseas replacement was simply not an option.”

With determination and technical confidence, the engineers of KCCP secured a 45-day planned outage from the National System Control Centre during the rainy season, when hydropower availability was higher. This strategic timing was crucial to minimising disruption to the grid.

Despite the OEM’s assessment, the engineering team embarked on the unprecedented challenge of restoring the damaged rotor locally. Drawing on international best practices, expert consultations, and their own ingenuity, the team meticulously carried out the repairs.

The results exceeded expectations. The restored rotor now operates within vibration levels that meet international standards for a brand-new unit of its type, ensuring both reliability and safety.

“This was a calculated risk,” Eng. Wimalaratne admitted. “But we were confident in the skills and dedication of our engineers. In the end, we proved that Sri Lankan expertise is more than capable of meeting such challenges.”

The successful local repair has saved the nation over Rs. 1.4 billion in foreign exchange and avoided unnecessary capital expenditure. More importantly, it has preserved the operational stability of one of the country’s most vital power stations.

By demonstrating that complex turbine rotor repairs can be carried out domestically, the achievement has broader implications for the future of Sri Lanka’s power sector. It has reinforced the importance of self-reliance and local capability at a time when foreign exchange reserves are under pressure.

“This is more than just a repair—it is a national triumph,” Eng. Wimalaratne declared with pride. “We not only saved billions but also sent a powerful message that Sri Lankan engineers can solve problems once thought beyond our reach.”

The engineers at Kelanitissa now stand as an example of how resilience, collaboration, and innovation can overcome formidable challenges. Their work not only brings prestige to the CEB but also strengthens public confidence in the technical expertise within Sri Lanka’s borders.

“The success at Kelanitissa sets a precedent,” Eng. Wimalaratne emphasised. “It shows that with confidence, innovation, and teamwork, we can avoid dependency on costly overseas solutions and build a path toward engineering self-reliance.”

Beyond the technical feat, the repair has significant implications for Sri Lanka’s energy and economic landscape. With rising global energy prices and limited fiscal space, reducing reliance on imports and unnecessary expenditure is critical.

The Kelanitissa achievement demonstrates how investing in local skills and expertise can yield tangible national benefits. It also highlights the importance of empowering engineers to make bold, innovative decisions in the face of daunting odds.
