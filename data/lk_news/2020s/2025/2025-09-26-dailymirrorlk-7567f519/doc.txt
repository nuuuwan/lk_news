Three National Hospitals still run without directors

Colombo, Sept. 26 (Daily Mirror) - Three of Sri Lanka’s National Hospitals have been operating without permanent directors for more than eight months, health sector sources said.

The institutions affected are the National Hospital in Colombo, the National Hospital in Kandy, and the Karapitiya National Hospital in Galle.

Currently, the National Hospital in Colombo is being managed by Dr. Pradeep Wijesinghe, who also serves as the Director of the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children. Dr. Wijesinghe has been handling the administration of both hospitals simultaneously.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, Deputy Minister of Health Dr. Hansaka Wijemuni said that interviews for Deputy Director General (DDG) positions had already been conducted.

“Nevertheless, the delay in announcing the results is due to a new procedure adopted by the Public Service Commission,” he added.

Health officials, however, stressed that the vacancies for these key administrative posts should have been filled much earlier to ensure the smooth functioning of the country’s largest hospitals.
