Dearo Agri partners with Agriculture Ministry for rice self- sufficiency in Sri Lanka

Dearo Agri, a subsidiary of the Dearo Investment Group which continuously supports the advancement of business and agriculture in Sri Lanka, has extended its support to the national initiative “Eka Mitata Govibimata” launched by the Government with the aim of achieving self-sufficiency in rice by cultivating abandoned paddy lands.

The programme, introduced under a new government concept, is being carried out with the involvement of Gampaha District Member of Parliament Ashoka Ranwala. Dearo Agri looks forward to partnering with the Government to implement the program across the country. Operating under the theme “The Sri Lankan spirit building a self-sufficient nation and a prosperous future,” Dearo Agri will provide financial sponsorship for the cultivation of more than 50 hectares of abandoned paddy lands in Gampaha, Kaduwela, and Biyagama.

The company will offer farmers interest-free financial facilities, repayable after harvest, enabling them to continue cultivation without the burden of high-interest loans. Additionally, Dearo Agri will provide its tractors and modern agricultural machinery to farmers through cooperative societies, supporting every stage of the process from land preparation to harvesting.
