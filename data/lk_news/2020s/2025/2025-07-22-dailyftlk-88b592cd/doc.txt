DIMO powers Marina Square – Colombo with state-of-the-art low voltage electrical solutions

DIMO, a leading diversified conglomerate in Sri Lanka, has successfully secured the order for design and supply of a comprehensive Low Voltage (LV) power distribution system for Marina Square – Colombo. This is one of the most prestigious and luxurious real estate developments in Colombo. This landmark project sets a new benchmark for upscale urban living in Sri Lanka, featuring 1,088 luxury apartments, a high-end retail mall, and premium amenities.

The fully integrated, state-of-the-art LV electrical distribution system by DIMO has been engineered to meet the high-performance demands of Marina Square, while significantly enhancing the project’s overall safety. A key component of the solution includes Type-Tested (Design-Verified) SIVACON LV Switchboards from SIEMENS, encompassing Sub/Floor Distribution Boards, and the innovative Apartment DBs manufactured under the DIMO Lumin brand.

Notably, these LV Switchboards were manufactured locally at DIMO’s advanced facility in Weliweriya, under a licensed partnership with SIEMENS. Compliant with IEC 61439-1 and 2 international standards, these panels ensure world-class quality and safety. The SIVACON LV Switchboards, one of the world’s best “Arc-Free” Switchboards, offer superior performance, modular flexibility, and unparalleled safety. The Double-Front PCCs, equipped with patented hole-less technology and advanced ventilation systems, are rated up to 7,000A and 150kA—making them ideal for complex, high-capacity power distribution environments.

All 1,088 apartments in the development are fitted with DIMO Lumin Apartment DBs—pre-wired, plug-and-play power distribution boards that eliminate the need for component assembly or complex wiring. Installers simply connect circuits to pre-assigned terminals, ensuring efficient setup with minimal time for the termination. These Apartment DBs are built to endure harsh conditions and support digital integration with dedicated troubleshooting terminals, offering a future-ready solution for residential infrastructure. Designed and manufactured at DIMO’s Weliweriya facility, these DBs underscore the company’s growing leadership in local power engineering innovation.

Commenting on this iconic LV project, DIMO Executive Director Wijith Pushpawela, who spearheads the group’s Power Engineering sector, said “For a project of this scale and importance, the developers were seeking more than just a supplier—they needed a partner with a proven track record in reliability, innovation, and service excellence. DIMO’s deep-rooted expertise in electrical solutions, backed by our strong partnership with global brands like SIEMENS, made us the preferred choice for Marina Square’s electrical distribution system. This project is a testament to DIMO’s smart engineering capabilities and advanced local manufacturing excellence, which continue to redefine standards in Sri Lanka’s real estate development sector.”

Developed by industry leaders Access Engineering PLC and China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC), Marina Square – Colombo comprises five 36-storey towers offering apartments ranging from one to four bedrooms, some featuring private gardens. With amenities such as an infinity pool, clubhouse, gym, children’s play area, and a fully integrated commercial precinct—including shops, food courts, health centres — the development prioritises natural lighting, ventilation, and resident convenience.

DIMO’s unwavering commitment to engineering excellence, innovation, and trusted partnerships continues to position the company as the go-to provider for advanced electrical solutions in Sri Lanka’s most prestigious developments.
