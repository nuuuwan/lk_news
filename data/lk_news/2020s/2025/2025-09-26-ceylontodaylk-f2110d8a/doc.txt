Captains to gather in Colombo as Women’s World Cup draws closer

Women’s team skippers are set to gather today (26), in Colombo for the official pre-tournament press conference, as the ICC Women’s ODI World Cup 2025 — jointly hosted by India and Sri Lanka — prepares to kick off. Warm-up matches are already underway in Colombo, setting the stage for what promises to be a landmark edition of the tournament.

The World Cup officially begins on 30 September and will run until 2 November, featuring 31 matches over 34 days in a round-robin format. The top four teams will advance to the semi-finals, with the final scheduled for 2 November.

This year marks a historic moment for Sri Lanka, which will host the Women’s World Cup for the first time, while India takes on hosting duties for the fourth time, having previously done so in 1978, 1997, and 2013. Matches will be played across Guwahati, Indore, Visakhapatnam, and Navi Mumbai in India, and Colombo in Sri Lanka. Colombo will host ten matches, including all of Pakistan’s fixtures, the first semi-final, and potentially the final, should Pakistan qualify.

The 2025 edition arrives during a golden phase for women’s ODI cricket, which has become increasingly high-scoring. Since the last World Cup in 2022, teams have posted 34 totals of 300 or more, with Australia and India each crossing the 400-run mark once. This surge reflects the growing depth, power, and professionalism in the women’s game, promising fans an electrifying tournament.

USD 13.88 million — nearly four times the amount offered in 2022. Another milestone is the all-female line-up of match officials, reinforcing the ICC’s commitment to gender equity and representation in global cricket.

Among the marquee fixtures, fans can look forward to India Vs Australia on 12 October in Visakhapatnam, Australia Vs England on 22 October in Indore, and the ever-popular India Vs Pakistan clash on 5 October at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. Historically, India has dominated this rivalry, winning all 11 ODI encounters against Pakistan.

Australia, led by Alyssa Healy, enters the tournament as defending champions and favourites, having lost just four of their last 31 ODIs. However, India, under Harmanpreet Kaur, has had a strong 2025 campaign and is widely seen as a serious contender. Teams like England, South Africa, and New Zealand also boast deep squads and proven tournament pedigree.

Emerging talents such as India’s Pratika Rawal, England’s Linsey Smith, and Pakistan’s Sadia Iqbal will be making their World Cup debuts, while seasoned stars like Chamari Athapaththu, Suzie Bates, and Marizanne Kapp may be playing in their final ODI World Cup, adding emotional weight to what is already a highly anticipated global event.
