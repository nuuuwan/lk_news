Seylan Cards with Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts hosted ‘The Gathering of Giants’ for 2nd consecutive year

Seylan Cards renewed its collaboration with Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts and its nature-based tourism arm, Cinnamon Nature Trails, as the exclusive banking partner for the second consecutive year with ‘The Gathering of Giants’, an event celebrating the world’s largest congregation of Asian elephants.

This wildlife phenomenon is unique to Sri Lanka, occurring every year between June and October, when elephant herds gather in large numbers along the shores of the tank at Minneriya National Park. Through its partnership, Seylan Bank enables a one-of-a-kind experience for its loyal customers, going beyond merely counting the number of elephants during a safari. Offering an exclusive experience for Seylan Cardholders, the partnership for ‘The Gathering of Giants’ featured a two-night, three-day package at Cinnamon Lodge Habarana. The offer also included two guided safaris by Cinnamon Nature Trails to witness the elephants in their natural habitat, along with a gala dinner and complimentary access to multiple presentations, workshops, and discussions aimed at educating and sharing knowledge.
