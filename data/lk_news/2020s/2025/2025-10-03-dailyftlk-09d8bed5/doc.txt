Sri Lanka strengthens trade, investment, and tourism ties at World Expo 2025 in Osaka

Sri Lanka showcased its export potential, investment opportunities, and tourism offerings at the Sri Lanka Business Forum and Networking Session held on 26 September during the World Expo 2025 in Osaka.

Organised by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) in collaboration with the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Japan, and supported by the Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) and the Sri Lanka Business Council of Japan (SLBCJ), the landmark event brought together around 20 leading Sri Lankan exporters from key sectors including apparel, tea, spices, gems and jewellery, food and beverages, handicrafts, and IT services. The Forum served as a dynamic platform to promote Sri Lanka’s authentic, high-quality, and globally trusted products to Japanese investors, importers, and industry leaders.

Opening the session, EDB Chairman/CEO Mangala Wijesinghe described the event as a milestone in strengthening the longstanding partnership between Sri Lanka and Japan.

“This forum demonstrates Sri Lanka’s commitment to building stronger economic bridges with Japan,” he said. “As Sri Lanka repositions itself as a regional trade hub, we are here to offer Japanese partners not only world-class products but also a stable and enabling business environment for investment.” He also highlighted Sri Lanka’s skilled workforce, improving logistics infrastructure, and its strategic location on major shipping lanes connecting East and West.

Sri Lanka’s Ambassador to Japan Prof. Janak Kumarasinghe underscored the depth of bilateral ties, cultural exchanges, and long-standing trade cooperation between the two nations.

JETRO Osaka Director General Hideki Sho emphasised Japan’s keen interest in expanding trade with Sri Lanka at Expo 2025 Osaka–Kansai, noting Sri Lanka’s steady economic recovery with eight consecutive quarters of growth and rising exports and tourism. He highlighted Sri Lanka’s strong reputation in Japan for high-quality Ceylon Tea, the growing potential of graphite exports for lithium-ion batteries, and the promising IT services sector. He urged participants to seize the forum’s opportunities to deepen Japan–Sri Lanka economic ties.

Delivering the keynote address, Chathuranga Abeysinghe highlighted Sri Lanka’s investor-friendly policies, strategic role as a South Asian gateway, and its export strengths spanning apparel, agriculture, gems, ICT, wellness, and creative industries. He described Expo 2025 as a platform to transform long-standing friendship and development cooperation into stronger business partnerships in trade, investment, tourism, and technology. He also emphasised Sri Lanka’s post-bankruptcy recovery, ongoing reforms, and commitment to sustainability and entrepreneurship, inviting Japanese businesses to explore opportunities in manufacturing, innovation, and SME collaboration.

During the country presentations, the EDB highlighted Sri Lanka’s export potential in emerging sectors such as wellness products, ICT, and sustainable agriculture. The Board of Investment outlined the latest policy measures, fiscal incentives, and industrial zones available for foreign investors, while the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau showcased the island’s diverse tourism attractions—from UNESCO heritage sites and wellness retreats to adventure tourism and MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, Exhibitions) opportunities.

These presentations were followed by a high-energy Business Networking Session, enabling Sri Lankan and Japanese businesses to explore collaboration opportunities, partnerships, and potential joint ventures. A networking lunch provided a relaxed environment for meaningful exchanges and relationship-building among participants.

The Sri Lanka Business Forum at World Expo 2025 reflects the country’s proactive approach to global trade promotion and its commitment to fostering long-term partnerships with international markets. For Japanese businesses and investors, the Forum offered a valuable opportunity to discover Sri Lanka’s diverse range of offerings—from traditional artisanal crafts to modern technological solutions.

In line with Expo 2025’s theme, “Designing Future Society for Our Lives” the event demonstrated how Sri Lankan enterprises contribute to a sustainable, innovative, and globally connected future. By leveraging the Expo’s international platform, Sri Lanka not only promoted its export industries but also enhanced its reputation as a trusted partner in the global marketplace.
