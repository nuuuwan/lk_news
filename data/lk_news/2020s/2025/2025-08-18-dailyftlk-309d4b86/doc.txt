Trillium Group last week opened Trillium Express – Ward Place, a vibrant new boutique city hotel redefining contemporary hospitality in the heart of Colombo 7, built with an investment of $ 4 million.

Located at 293 Ward Place, Colombo 7, near Sri Lanka’s largest and busiest traffic hub hustling and bustling with commuters — Borella Junction — the hotel offers unmatched connectivity, providing guests with quick access to Bandaranaike International Airport, Colombo’s central business district, and the city’s suburban areas.

Housed in one of Colombo’s most iconic post-colonial era high-rise buildings — fondly remembered as the Dasa Building — the property has been meticulously transformed into a modern, stylish hospitality destination. This transformation blends the charm of Colombo’s heritage architecture with the comfort and efficiency of a world-class boutique city hotel.

This is Trillium’s second hotel development in Colombo 7, further strengthening the Group’s footprint in the city’s hospitality offerings.

The property features 45 elegantly appointed rooms, including Suites, Twins, Doubles, Triples, and Quads, designed to cater to both business and leisure travellers.

Facilities include a banquet hall accommodating up to 300 guests for weddings, corporate functions, and private events, a rooftop restaurant serving curated cuisine with panoramic city views, a rooftop pool overlooking the Colombo skyline, and a cosy café outlet offering a relaxed space for casual meetings or quick refreshments.

The launch event took place on 13 August, marking the beginning of Trillium Express’s journey to deliver exceptional stays, personalised service, and an authentic city-living experience.

Trillium Group Chairman Janaka Ratnayake said: “Trillium Express – Ward Place represents more than just a new hotel — it’s a celebration of Colombo’s evolving hospitality landscape. We are proud to breathe new life into one of the city’s most historic buildings and offer guests a fresh, dynamic experience in the heart of the capital.”

The opening of Trillium Express – Ward Place is part of Trillium Group’s continued expansion in Sri Lanka’s hospitality sector, building on the success of Trillium Boutique City Hotel located in Torrington Avenue in Colombo 7 and other real estate developments around Colombo.
