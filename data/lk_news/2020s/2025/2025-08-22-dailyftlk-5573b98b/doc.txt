Profood Propack & Agbiz 2025 opens at BMICH

Sri Lanka’s most anticipated food industry event, Profood Propack & Agbiz 2025, began yesterday at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Exhibition and Convention Centre, BMICH, Colombo.

The exhibition is organised by the Sri Lanka Food Processors Association (SLFPA) in collaboration with Lanka Exhibition and Conference Services (LECS).

Endorsed by the Industries Ministry, the National Agribusiness Council, and the Institute of Food Science and Technology Sri Lanka (IFSTSL), the exhibition continues its legacy as a driving force in advancing Sri Lanka’s food sector.

For over 25 years, Profood Propack & Agbiz has stood as SLFPA’s flagship platform, bringing together leaders in agriculture, food processing, packaging, and allied services. The event fosters knowledge-sharing, innovation, and strategic partnerships, while significantly contributing to the nation’s economic growth, the organisers said in a statement.

This year, the Knowledge Hub, introduced last year, has been expanded to include a dedicated Consumer Assistance Desk. This initiative serves as a valuable resource for new entrepreneurs, offering guidance and support in identifying business opportunities.

A central focus of the exhibition is to empower Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The platform provides SMEs with the chance to showcase their products, build connections, access new markets, and explore collaborations—further underlining their vital role in national development.
