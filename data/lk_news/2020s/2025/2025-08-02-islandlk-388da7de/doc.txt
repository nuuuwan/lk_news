Echoes from the Rock: The Two Women’s Cave of Buddama

“Beneath the sun-scorched rocks of Buddama Hela, two women whisper their stories through strokes of ash and silence. Theirs is not a tale of royalty or conquest—but of memory, survival, and the wild poetry of a forgotten world.”

High above the sleepy hamlet of Buddama in Monaragala District, a silent hill rises like a guardian of secrets, Buddama Hela, a rocky ridge veiled in forest and time. It is home to a cave unknown to most, untouched by guidebooks or popular archaeology. But those who’ve walked its narrow paths and touched its cool stone walls speak of something extraordinary, a place where prehistory brushes against the present, in fading pigment and profound mystery.

or Two Women’s Cave. It’s a name that stirs curiosity, even reverence. Thanks to the dogged determination of herpetologist and field biologist Dr. Nimal D. Rathnayake and his dedicated team consisting of Ayoma Rathnayake, Kalinga Hewamathes, and Deepika Wickramasinghe, this sacred place is finally receiving the attention it so richly deserves.

What makes the Two Women’s Cave so compelling isn’t just its physical isolation or faded rock art but the human emotion woven into its walls. Within the weathered chamber, prehistoric drawings sprawl across the stone: animals, birds, indistinct figures, and one particularly stirring image of a man subduing a creature, perhaps a pig or a deer, with rope or stick in hand.

For Dr. Rathnayake and his team, these images are not just decorative; they are evidence of daily life, ritual, survival.

Speaking exclusively to The Sunday Island, Dr. Rathnayakehe added:”These are stories left behind in ash and pigment. They tell of a community living with and depending on nature. They show animals not only as food but as partners in survival. The art is raw, functional, and deeply human.”

Unlike the grand frescoes of Sigiriya or the religious iconography of Dambulla, these paintings are humble. They lack grandeur, but not power. And herein lies their magic: they are a direct line to the pulse of a prehistoric people. They very likely the Veddas, Sri Lanka’s indigenous forest-dwelling community.

Local folklore insists that two Vedda women once lived here, away from their tribe, perhaps waiting for their hunters to return or performing tasks assigned by tradition. The site’s name, Gehenu Dennage Galge, is not mere embellishment. For generations, villagers have passed down tales of these women who occupied the cave, etched memories into stone, and kept watch over the valley below.

In the early 20th century, anthropologists Seligmann and Seligmann documented how Vedda women acknowledged creating such drawings using ash mixed with saliva, applied using sticks or fingers.

“We often forget that early art was not always for worship or beauty. It was a way of recording life,” explains Ayoma Rathnayake, who assisted in analyzing the images. “These women weren’t artists in the traditional sense; they were memory keepers.”

The drawings, though rudimentary, hint at a very specific function. Dr. Rathnayake’s team suspects that the Two Women’s Cave may have once served as a slaughterhouse.

“This isn’t a random cave,” says Kalinga Hewamathes. “The images are purposeful. They focus heavily on animals. It suggests a site of processing, maybe even storing.”

One image, in particular, stands out—a man with a tool or rope in hand restraining an animal. It’s an act that hints at domestication, rearing, or preparation for slaughter. Combined with oral traditions of caves used for specific trades, like Ridi Lena for silverwork and Waduge Lena for carpentry, the theory gains traction.

“If those caves were used for teaching industries,” Deepika Wickramasinghe adds, “it’s reasonable to assume this one served a critical but less glamorous purpose, preparing meat for sustenance.”

The cave’s location, midway up the hill, secluded from daily foot traffic, lends further weight to this theory. It was accessible but removed, functional yet sacred.

The cave is not only an archaeological marvel but also a site of ecological significance. Nestled within its dark interiors are the communal egg-laying sites of the Sri Lankan golden rock gecko (Calodactylodes illingworthorum)—a rare and beautiful species found only in Sri Lanka.

The presence of these reptiles, their eggs glued to the rock in delicate clutches, adds another layer of urgency to conservation efforts.

“We are not just protecting paint,” emphasizes Dr. Rathnayake. “We’re protecting life, past and present. The cave is both a museum and a maternity ward.”

The coexistence of ancient human art and modern animal behavior in one cave is nothing short of poetic. It’s a testament to the continuity of life and nature’s resilience.

Despite its archaeological and ecological importance, the Two Women’s Cave remains dangerously vulnerable. There are neither formal protections in place nor signage, nor fences, not even a walking path. While this lack of access has spared the cave from vandalism or tourism-related damage, it has left it open to natural degradation.

“Sunlight, rain, and lichen can erase these drawings,” warns Dr. Rathnayake. “A single monsoon season could do more damage than a decade of human neglect.”

No carbon dating has yet been performed, and no professional excavations have been undertaken. Without a proper condition report, conservation plan, and community education efforts, this unique site risks slipping through history’s fingers.

Buddama is no stranger to antiquity. The Buddama Rajamaha Viharaya, located just 1.5 km from the cave, dates to the 3rd century BC. According to the Mahawamsa and several ancient inscriptions, it served as a significant administrative and spiritual center during the reign of King Parakramabahu I and later during King Sri Wickrama Rajasingha’s Kandyan renovations.

But the Two Women’s Cave tells a more intimate story. It is not about kings or conquest; it is about survival, labor, and the quiet contributions of indigenous women. It is about the hunters and their families, the forests and their offerings, the rituals that made life possible in a world untouched by temples or titles.

“These are not the stories carved into stone slabs at temples,” Dr. Rathnayake reflects. “These are the stories painted in secrecy, in silence, in survival.”

Dr. Rathnayake and his team are calling for a comprehensive conservation management plan for the site. This would include:

Carbon dating of the pigment material to determine the age of the drawings

Collaboration with the Department of Archaeology and Department of Wildlife Conservation Community education programs to build local stewardship

“The villagers here are not the enemy,” says Ayoma Rathnayake. “Many of them revere these caves. If we can empower them, they’ll become the best protectors we could ask for.”

Indeed, heritage is safest when it is loved and not locked away.

At its core, the Two Women’s Cave is not just a site. It is a whisper from women who once lived, painted, and waited beneath that rock ceiling. They did not ask to be remembered. They simply left behind drawings in ash and earth, hoping perhaps to make sense of their world.

And now, in 2025, a team of Sri Lankan scientists has begun to listen.

“They left us stories,” Dr. Rathnayake says, running his fingers over a faint line on the cave wall. “It’s our turn to carry them forward.”

The Two Women’s Cave remains unmarked and unprotected. Visitors are urged not to attempt entry without proper guidance. Touching the paintings or disturbing the gecko nesting sites could irreparably damage this irreplaceable heritage.
