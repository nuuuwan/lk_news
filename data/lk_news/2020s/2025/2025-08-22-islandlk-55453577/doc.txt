“75% of APAC CFOs believe that AI agents will drive revenue and transform existing organizational structures”

Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) in Asia Pacific (APAC) are moving from caution to confidence in Artificial Intelligence (AI), according to new Salesforce research. Once conservative in their approach, CFOs are now embracing AI as a strategic investment for long-term growth.

In 2020, 63% of APAC CFOs maintained a conservative AI strategy. Today, only 3% remain cautious, while a growing share have adopted aggressive adoption plans. Half of CFOs say AI agents — digital labor capable of performing tasks autonomously — are reshaping how they evaluate ROI, expanding measures of success beyond traditional financial returns.

“The introduction of digital labor isn’t just a technical upgrade — it represents a decisive and strategic shift for CFOs,” said Robin Washington, President and Chief Operating and Financial Officer at Salesforce. “With AI agents, we’re not merely transforming business models; we’re fundamentally reshaping the entire scope of the CFO function. This demands a new mindset as we expand beyond financial stewards to also become architects of agentic enterprise value.

CFOs are now dedicating nearly a quarter of their AI budgets to agents, with 75% believing they will both cut costs and drive revenue. Those adopting AI expect nearly a 20% uplift in company revenue. Already, 83% of APAC CFOs are using AI for decisions such as risk assessments, forecasting, and profitability analysis, signalling that AI has become a core partner in redefining enterprise value.
