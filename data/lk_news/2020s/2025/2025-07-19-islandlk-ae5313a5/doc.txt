“Every Mountain Has Its Own Story”

In the quiet early hours of July 8th, the arrivals terminal of the Bandaranaike International Airport was filled with something far greater than applause or fanfare—it was filled with emotion. Flags fluttered, voices called out, and arms opened wide in a heartfelt welcome. Sri Lanka’s own Johann Peries—the first Sri Lankan to climb all Seven Summits—had returned home. But for Johann, it wasn’t about glory or recognition.

Speaking to The Sunday, he said:”So actually getting back to Sri Lanka, going back home was the most important thing for me,” he said, voice steady but heartfelt. “After being away for one month and under those conditions, being alone… getting back to your own home country was really emotional for me, especially after taking on a task like this.”

The achievement is extraordinary by any measure. Climbing the highest peaks on each of the seven continents—Everest in Asia, Aconcagua in South America, Denali in North America, Kilimanjaro in Africa, Elbrus in Europe, Mount Vinson in Antarctica, and Carstensz Pyramid in Oceania—is a feat attempted by few and completed by even fewer. Johann Peries joins that elite club, carrying with him the hopes and pride of an entire nation.

“This originally started with me taking it on as a personal journey,” he explained. “But later on I realised that I was carrying the national flag with me, and that meant a lot of pride. Taking my flag with me to the highest point of each continent—it gave me great honour. Every time I took the flag out on top there, it was very emotional for me. I kept saying that I’m not doing this just for me, but for the nation and its people.”

For Johann, climbing has never been about ego or records. He doesn’t speak in clichés, and he avoids the word “conquer” entirely.

“I do not use the word ‘conquered’ because nature is something you cannot conquer. As Sir Edmund Hillary said, it is not the mountain that you conquer but yourself. So I always say I climbed. I summited.”

He has now summited five of the Seven Summits and reached the highest point possible on the other two—no less an achievement. For him, it was always about the journey, the responsibility, and the lessons.

“That itself was a huge challenge for me, and it really gives me great honour, like I said before.”

And yet, for all the physical demands, the real test, he insists, was mental.

“Every mountain has its own challenges. People keep saying, ‘You climbed Everest, so this is nothing.’ But I keep telling them: every mountain has its own personality. It can be the shortest one, but it can challenge you in a completely different way. For me, this was more than a physical challenge—it was a mental one.”

“Being out there all by yourself, under conditions we’ve never experienced before—storms, snowstorms, avalanches—and meeting new people, climbing with new people … there were times when we didn’t know if we were going to come back.”

And sometimes, the thin line between success and tragedy appeared right in front of him.

“There was a moment I’ll never forget. We were just about to get to the last ridge after nearly 15 days. There was this huge crevice we had to cross, and the guy in front of me slipped. He fell backwards—legs up, head down, hanging. I had to help him mentally, guide him back onto the rope.”

The image is burned into his memory. The climber, shaken, gave up shortly after.

“That could have been me. That moment will stay with me forever.”

Johann’s passion for the outdoors didn’t begin on Everest. It began in his childhood.

“It was my father who inspired me. He didn’t hold us back. We used to go outdoors—fishing, climbing, exploring. That’s where it all started.”

Over time, those simple childhood adventures grew into a deeper calling. He wanted to test himself, to see how far he could go.

“The first dream was to climb Everest. We did that. And then the question came—what next?”

That question led to a new goal: completing the Seven Summits. But it also raised new challenges.

“People often think that once you’ve done Everest, you’re invincible. But that’s not how it works. Every climb is different. You still have to prepare, sacrifice, train. People underestimate that. I don’t party before expeditions. I’m up at 4.30 or 5 a.m. to train. On weekends, I go up-country for altitude training.”

“If you don’t prepare, the mountain becomes your enemy. But if you do it right, you have a chance. You need to be physically ready, but also mentally prepared. That’s where many fall short.”

With the Seven Summits behind him, one might assume Johann is ready to rest. But he sees this not as the end, but the beginning of something far greater.

“The summit is not the end. It’s the beginning of another era for me. I’m asked again, ‘What next?’ And I keep saying: there are so many other mountains. Some I want to attempt again. But I also want to inspire others, train others.”

In that spirit, Johann is exploring the possibility of starting a mountaineering school or foundation in Sri Lanka.

“We already have amazing people in this field—some beyond me in many ways. I want to join hands, collaborate, bring people together.”

His dream is to create pathways for young Sri Lankans to enter the world of mountaineering, survival training, and outdoor exploration—not just for sport, but for character building.

“We have the potential to put Sri Lanka on the map, not just in cricket or tourism, but in adventure, resilience, and exploration.”

He wants to create a platform where discipline, preparation, and courage are instilled from a young age.

“We need to come together and stand together. If we work as one, we can lift the nation.”

Johann’s message to athletes, explorers, and everyday dreamers is simple but powerful.

“You have to have determination, strength, and courage. But above all, you need commitment. Whatever your dream is—whether it’s in sports, business, or academics—you must stay committed. There’s always a first step. You just have to take it.”

He acknowledges that not everyone’s mountain is physical. Sometimes it’s poverty, fear, trauma, or simply self-doubt. But all mountains, he insists, can be climbed.

“There are many mountains in my life still to climb. And I’ll keep working toward them—as I have done in the past.”

A book is in the works, capturing not just his adventures, but the emotional, spiritual, and psychological landscapes of his journey. Through storytelling, mentoring, and training, Johann hopes to pass on what he’s learned—not just about summits, but about life.

As Sri Lanka welcomed its climber home, Johann brought back more than a passport full of stamps or Instagram-worthy summit photos. He brought back resilience. He brought back perspective.

“When you’re up there, you realise how small we are. The mountain is bigger than you. Nature is bigger than you. Life is bigger than you. And yet, you find strength in that.”

His journey is proof that greatness often comes not from triumph, but from humility, reflection, and grit.

So when Johann Peries unfurled the Sri Lankan flag at the roof of each continent, he wasn’t just marking personal achievement. He was planting a seed of possibility in every Sri Lankan heart.
