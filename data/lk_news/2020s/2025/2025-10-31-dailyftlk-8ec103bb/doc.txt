Only Anura can build a drug-free nation: Most Ven. Assaji Thero

Colombo Navakorala Sangha Chapter Chief Prelate and Gangaramaya Temple Chief Incumbent Most Ven. Dr. Kirinde Assaji Thero

Colombo Navakorala Sangha Chapter Chief Prelate and Gangaramaya Temple Chief Incumbent Most Ven. Dr. Kirinde Assaji Thero on Thursday declared that President Anura Kumara Disanayake is the only leader capable of freeing the nation from the drug menace.

He made this remark during his address at the launch of the national initiative “One Nation Against Drugs” held at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium.

Ven. Assaji Thero emphasised that the country is currently facing a serious crisis due to the spread of illicit drugs, which has reached schools and deeply affected families and society at large. The Thero stressed that the President’s efforts to eradicate drug addiction and dismantle organised crime networks represent a critical investment in safeguarding the future generations of Sri Lanka.

“Even parents today are helpless. Society has deteriorated to the extent that people no longer think about religion, values, or even their own children,” Ven. Assaji Thero said.

The Thero highlighted that Sri Lanka has become a significant hub for drug trafficking networks and warned that failure to act decisively at this stage would result in a devastated future — “a mentally deranged society with no hope.”

According to Ven. Assaji Thero, the drug trade is closely tied to organised crime and international mafia networks, where large amounts of money circulate. He noted that the President’s actions to disrupt these networks, including suppressing underworld elements, involve major risks for any political leader.

“This is not merely a drug eradication campaign — it is a national duty. The President has placed his leadership and even personal safety at stake to protect our future,” he added.

The Thero further stated that Sri Lanka has overcome many major crises in the past, including 30 years of terrorism and more recently, the COVID-19 pandemic and economic collapse. However, he warned that no sector — tourism, industry, agriculture, or spiritual and moral development — can progress unless the country first succeeds in eliminating drugs and underworld crime.

Ven. Assaji Thero called on all citizens, regardless of political, religious, or ethnic differences, to support this national mission. “This is a farsighted initiative. The blessings of the people, as well as the blessings of the Maha Sangha, are fully with this effort,” the Thero declared.
