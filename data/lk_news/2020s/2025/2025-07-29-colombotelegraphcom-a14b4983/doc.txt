38 Years Since Indo-Sri Lanka Accord: Time to Honour The 13th Amendment & Hold Provincial Elections

29 July 2025 marks the 38th anniversary of the signing of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord — a landmark agreement intended to bring an end to Sri Lanka’s ethnic conflict and provide a political solution for the long-marginalised Tamil community. Signed in 1987 between then Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President JR Jayewardene, the Accord promised devolution of power through constitutional reform.

At the heart of that commitment was the introduction of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which led to the establishment of Provincial Councils — a mechanism designed to give Sri Lanka’s provinces, especially the Tamil-majority North and East, a degree of self-governance.

Yet, nearly four decades later, the core promises of the Accord remain unfulfilled. While the legal framework exists, successive governments have failed to fully implement the provisions of the 13th Amendment. The failure to hold provincial council elections, particularly in the North and East, represents not only a breach of constitutional responsibility but also a disregard for democratic governance and reconciliation.

Provincial councils are not optional political experiments — they are embedded in Sri Lanka’s Constitution. The ongoing delay in holding elections violates constitutional obligations and undermines the rule of law. It also erodes public trust and signals an unwillingness to share power with minority communities, further complicating efforts to build a united, democratic Sri Lanka.

The current government, like its predecessors, has promised to conduct the elections — but no concrete action has followed. The absence of a timeline or commitment has left the Northern and Eastern Provinces in administrative limbo.

Beyond the legal and political dimensions, the delay has serious economic consequences. The lack of accountable and representative provincial governance affects the planning and implementation of development projects, especially in post-war regions that continue to suffer from high unemployment and underinvestment.

Restoring elected provincial councils would allow for regionally tailored development and community-led governance, providing a foundation for sustainable economic growth. It would also open doors for increased investment from the Tamil diaspora, many of whom are showing renewed interest in contributing to rebuilding efforts — particularly in sectors like agriculture, renewable energy, tourism, education, and small enterprise.

But these investments require stability and trust in local governance structures. Holding elections would send a powerful message that the government is committed to both democratic accountability and economic revitalisation in the regions most affected by the war.

As Sri Lanka navigates economic hardship, political uncertainty, and international scrutiny, fulfilling the promises of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord presents an opportunity to demonstrate goodwill, maturity, and commitment to democratic principles.

Holding provincial elections without further delay is essential — not only as a constitutional requirement but as a moral imperative to heal historical wounds, restore local governance, and set the course for a more inclusive and prosperous future.

After 39 years, the time has come for Sri Lanka to move from promises to action. The Accord must not be remembered only as a document of the past, but as a living commitment to justice, equality, and meaningful power-sharing.
