# GSMB suspends mineral transport during school hours

The Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) has announced that mineral transportation will be suspended on school days from 6:30 a.m. to 7:45 a.m. and again from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.

Deepani Weerakoon, Director General of the GSMB, stated yesterday (7) that this decision was made following a fatal accident involving a school van and a tipper truck transporting sand, which claimed the lives of two students and the van driver.

Previously, licensed tipper trucks were authorised to transport minerals between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. However, the tragic head-on collision near Wilapola Junction, Panniwila Bridge, prompted the bureau to revise the transport schedule.

The new restrictions came into effect yesterday (7), the GSMB confirmed.
