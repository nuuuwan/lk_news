Sri Lanka Suffers Second Super Four Defeat

Sri Lanka suffered their second defeat in the Super Four stage of the ACC Men’s Asia Cup 2025, falling to Pakistan by five wickets in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday (24) .

Batting first, Sri Lanka lost the plot early, collapsing to 58 for 5 within eight overs. Kamindu Mendis stood firm amid the chaos, scoring a fighting 50, and added 43 runs for the seventh wicket with Chamika Karunaratne to help Sri Lanka reach 133 for 8. Despite signs of recovery, Pakistan struck at regular intervals to restrict further progress.

Pakistan began their chase strongly, racing to 45 without loss inside the powerplay. However, Maheesh Theekshana struck twice in the sixth over, followed by two wickets from Wanindu Hasaranga de Silva, reducing Pakistan to 57 for 4 in the ninth over — giving Sri Lanka hope of pulling off a low-scoring thriller.

But Pakistan’s middle order held firm. Hussain Talat (32) and Mohammad Nawaz (38) stitched together an unbeaten 58-run stand for the sixth wicket, guiding their team home in 18 overs without further hiccups.

Sri Lanka opted for a five-bowler strategy, bringing in Chamika Karunaratne and Maheesh Theekshana in place of Kamil Mishara and Dunith Wellalage. The move left them a batter short — a costly decision in a match where runs were at a premium.

Mathematically, Sri Lanka still has a slim chance of reaching the final, but it now depends on other results going in their favour.

Sri Lanka 133/8 (Kamindu Mendis 50, Charith Asalanka 20; Shaheen Shah Afridi 3/28, Haris Rauf 2/37, Hussain Talat 2/18)

Pakistan 138/5 in 18.0 overs (Mohammad Nawaz 38 n.o, Hussain Talat 32 n.o, Maheesh Theekshana 2-24,Wanindu Hasaranga de Silva 2-27)
