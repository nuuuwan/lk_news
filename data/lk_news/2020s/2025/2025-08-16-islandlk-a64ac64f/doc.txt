Konka launches groundbreaking V-Max TV range in Lanka via FLiCo

Colombo saw the Sri Lankan debut of global electronics giant Konka’s latest innovation—the Konka V-Max TV range—introduced in partnership with Future Life Holdings Group and its flagship retail arm FLiCo.

Celebrating 45 years as a global leader in home electronics, Konka’s V-Max series promises to revolutionize the local market with cutting-edge technology and immersive home entertainment. Available in 32″, 43″, 55″, and 65″ sizes, the V-Max range features Operating TV OS, Web OS, and Google TV OS platforms.

A standout feature is the built-in integrated soundbar, eliminating the need for external speakers while offering 30W Dolby Audio surround sound for a cinematic experience. The TVs also support HDR 10, delivering stunning visuals and balanced acoustics. Uniquely, the independent soundbar can play music even when the TV screen is off, catering to evolving lifestyle needs.

Konka V-Max TVs are designed for ease—no remote hassles, no wiring issues, and minimal setup time—bringing true convenience and performance to modern homes.

Backed by the expertise of Future Life Holdings Group, the launch aligns with FLiCo’s mission of offering high-performance products that elevate everyday living. Under the theme “Your Life, Your Style,” FLiCo brings trusted global brands to local consumers, supported by professional installations and reliable after-sales services.
