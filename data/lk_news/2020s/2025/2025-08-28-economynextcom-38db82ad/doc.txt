Sri Lanka working with India, Abu Dhabi and Indonesia to apprehend criminals: Official

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s police was working with India, Malaysia, Thailand, Abu Dhabi and Indonesia officials to apprehend criminals, Ministry of Public Security secretary Ravi Seneviratne said.

“Organized criminal gangs operating from foreign states increased in the recent past,” Seneviratne told reporters. “This was a huge challenge to crack down on crime in our country.”

“They operated from neighbouring countries such as India, Malaysia, Thailand, Abu Dhabi in the middle east, and Indonesia.”

The government was able to build on bilateral ties, conduct discussions with these countries and work with them to apprehend criminals he said.

“Intelligence agencies in India, Malaysia, Thailand, Abu Dhabi and Indonesia, aided us in this effort.”

This enabled criminals operating from India and Abu Dhabi to be extradited back to Sri Lanka to face legal proceedings, he said.

Underworld operative Kehelbaddara Padme, in particular, proved to be hard to catch, Seneviratne said.

“His arrest was able because of the cooperation of Indonesian officials.”

Public Security Minister Ananda Wijepala said 75 red warrants have been issued so far, with 20 alleged criminals brought back to Sri Lanka. (Colombo/Aug28/2025)
