Ways of Knowing: New exhibition opening at the Geoffrey Bawa Space

How do we know what we know? This is the central question of the latest exhibition by the Geoffrey Bawa Trust. Opening at the Bawa Space gallery on Horton Place in early August, Ways of Knowing uses Geoffrey Bawa’s garden, Lunuganga, to explore different forms of knowledge and the ways we learn, store, and share information.

Looking across seven installations—including virtual reality, film, textiles, oral traditions, maps, seeds, and the human body—the exhibition explores at how intelligence and understanding are gained through different mediums. Designed as a multi-sensory experience, Ways of Knowing emphasises forms of perception in addition to sight, and reflects on the many ways we come to understand the world around us.
