Govt. denies plans to list State banks on Colombo Stock Exchange

Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa yesterday dismissed speculation that the Government intends to list the two main State banks on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), calling such claims “just rumours.”

“The matter was not taken up at the Monday Cabinet meeting, which means it was not discussed. The rumours were just rumours,” he clarified at the weekly post-Cabinet media briefing.

The comments come in response to claims by the trade unions of the two State banks, who alleged that 20% of the banks’ shares would be listed on the CSE and expressed concerns over potential moves to privatise the institutions. The unions also raised several other issues related to employee welfare and management decisions.

Dr. Jayatissa reassured that the Government has no plans to privatise or list the State-owned banks.
