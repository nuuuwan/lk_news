Rhino launches ‘Rhino Premier’: Game-changer in roofing innovation

Rhino Roofing, Sri Lanka’s most trusted name in roofing and ceiling sheets, unveiled its latest innovation, ‘Rhino Premier Roofing Sheets’, at a grand launch ceremony that took place on 15 August, at the Cumulus Ballroom, Cinnamon Life, Colombo.

Bringing together leading architects, developers, contractors, members of Chamber of Construction Industry and Chartered Institute of Building, and Rhino’s network of authorised dealers, the event marked a significant milestone in the brand’s continued journey of innovation.

Setting a new benchmark in roofing excellence, Rhino Premier became Sri Lanka’s first roofing sheet to feature advanced water-repellent surface protection, which is designed specifically for enhanced durability and long-term weather resistance. Built with a natural clay matte undercoat, its underside offers a refined, visually appealing finish. Backed by a five-year aesthetic warranty, Rhino Premier is designed to meet the demands of modern architecture, seamlessly blending durability with design sophistication.

With a heritage of over 60 years, Rhino has continuously led the roofing and ceiling sector in Sri Lanka, offering products that balance affordability, durability and design aesthetics. Recognised by SLIM-Kantar as one of the top 10 brands in the construction and hardware industries, Rhino’s commitment to quality and innovation remains steadfast.

Guests at the launch were invited to engage with interactive product displays and a unique Idea Wall, where professionals from across the industry shared concepts, inspirations, and previews of future projects. This collective expression of creativity turned the Idea Wall into a vibrant reflection of what’s possible when innovation meets imagination.
