Tara Rajapaksha recognised as Best Korean Language Teacher at Asia Miracle Awards 2025

Tara Rajapaksha, founder of the Korean Language Centre (KLC) in Kadawatha, has been recognized as the Best Korean Language Teacher of the Year at the prestigious Asia Miracle Awards 2025. The award ceremony took place recently at the Taj Samudra Hotel in Colombo, celebrating her outstanding contributions to language education and workforce development.

With over 25 years of teaching experience, Rajapaksha has played a pivotal role in empowering Sri Lankan youth by equipping them with Korean language skills essential for employment opportunities in South Korea. Her institution, KLC Kadawatha, has trained thousands of students for the Korean Language Proficiency Exam (EPS-TOPIK), with many achieving high scores and securing jobs in key industries such as manufacturing, construction, shipping, and fisheries.

KLC stands out for its personalized teaching approach, ensuring each student receives individual attention to build confidence and proficiency.

Under a government-to-government agreement, Sri Lanka receives an annual quota of employment opportunities in South Korea, facilitated by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE). Unskilled workers aged 18–39 who pass the EPS-TOPIK exam can secure jobs with a minimum monthly salary of LKR 500,000 in sectors like manufacturing, construction, agriculture, and fisheries.
