Construction PMI increases in August

Sri Lanka Purchasing Managers’ Index for Construction (PMI–Construction) increased further in August 2025, as reflected by the total activity index which registered a value of 61.1 indicating a continuous expansion in construction activities.

The Central Bank said most respondents highlighted the ongoing increase in project availability, along with the resumption of some temporarily suspended projects, has strengthened the confidence of the construction sector.

The New Orders Index also increased in August. According to survey respondents, road development and water supply work were the most commonly awarded project types during the month.

In August, both the Employment and Quantity of Purchases indices increased, indicating the optimism for continued growth in the construction work.

Meanwhile, the suppliers’ delivery time further lengthened during the month, driven by the increase in demand for construction material.

The outlook of the construction sector is projected to be positive, underpinned by the expected increase in new project opportunities.
