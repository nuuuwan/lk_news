Sri Lanka’s economy records mixed sectoral growth in Q2 2025

According to the latest report released by the Department of Census and Statistics for the second quarter of 2025 (April 1 – June 30), Sri Lanka’s fisheries sector, vegetable cultivation, and rubber cultivation have recorded unstable performances, showing negative growth trends.

The data indicate that despite expansion in majority of agriculture activities, ‘Fresh water fishing and fresh water aquaculture’ (34.8 percent), ‘Growing of rubber’ (10.8 percent), ‘Marine fishing’ (5.2 percent) and ‘Growing of vegetables’ (3.6 percent) reported contractions in the second quarter of 2025.

Meanwhile, ‘Growing of rubber’, a major contributor to exports, recorded a decline of 10.8%.

Despite these setbacks, overall agriculture, industry, and services recorded positive growth during the quarter.

In the second quarter of 2025, Agricultural activities, Industrial activities and Services activities all reported increases of 2.0%, 5.8% and 3.9% respectively, it said.

Under the production approach, several crops including paddy, cereals, sugarcane, fruits, and spices reported significant positive growth.
