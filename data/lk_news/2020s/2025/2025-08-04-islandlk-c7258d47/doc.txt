Birthday celebrations …

Thursday, 24th July, was a special day for the incomparable bassist Benjy Ranabahu.

Yes, it was his birthday but the real celebrations took place a day later, at The Hut, Mount Lavinia.

It was a musical evening, with Benjy’s group, Inner Vision, in action, and the party went on till 1 am.

The highlight of the evening was, undoubtedly, the guest appearance of veteran singer Manilal Perera and Rodney Rabot, with Judy de Silva turning up later.

Both Manilal and Rodney were outstanding and those present appreciated their vibrant personality, and vocals.

Rodney, incidentally, was a member of the original Amazing Grace, in 1974.

It was around midnight that the cake cutting ceremony took place, and with the baila taking over for the final session.
