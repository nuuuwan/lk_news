Two passengers attempting to smuggle a stock of undeclared mobile phones, tablet computers, cosmetics and boxes of tobacco rolling papers worth Rs. 5 million in total have been arrested by customs officers at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake during the early hours today (12).

Accordingly, customs officers seized five pieces of luggage carried by the suspects, which contained 132 latest-model mobile phones, 14 tablet computers, 1,700 boxes of tobacco rolling papers, and a large stock of cosmetic products.

Further investigations into the suspects are currently being carried out by customs officials at the Katunayake Airport.
