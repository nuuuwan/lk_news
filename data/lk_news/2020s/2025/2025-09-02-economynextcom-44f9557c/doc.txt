Sri Lanka gets banana culture lab with FAO, China help

ECONOMYNEXT – A state-of-the-art banana tissue culture planting material production laboratory has been set up in Sri Lanka’s North Central Province, with technical assistance from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) under the South-South Cooperation (SSC) Programme with China.

The lab is at the North Central Provincial Agriculture Department’s In-Service Training Institute in Maha Illuppallama.

It will provide high-quality banana tissue cultured planting materials to farmers in the North Central, Northern, and North Western Provinces, the FAO said.

“Until now, farmers in these regions have relied on supplies transported from the southern part of the country, which proved both costly and inefficient due to transport-related damage.”

The facility will improve the availability of disease-free, high-yielding banana planting materials, enabling producers to increase productivity, quality, and profitability.

“By combining Sri Lanka’s commitment to agricultural development with FAO’s technical expertise and China’s support through South-South Cooperation, we are ensuring that farmers have access to the quality planting material they need to increase productivity and incomes,”  Vimlendra Sharan, FAO Representative for Sri Lanka and the Maldives, said.

FAO supported the establishment of the laboratory by financing the procurement of specialized equipment and chemicals, and by facilitating technical training for staff to ensure smooth operations and high standards.

“By improving farmers’ access to high-quality planting material, we are empowering our agricultural communities, reducing costs, and paving the way for greater competitiveness in local and international markets,” North Central Province Governor Wasantha Jinadasa said. (Colombo/Sep2/2025)
