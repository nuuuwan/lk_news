Dipped Products PLC (DPL), a member of the Hayleys Group and a global leader in hand protection solutions spanning the medical, household, industrial, and sports sectors, was honoured with the Overall Gold Award at the National Business Excellence Awards (NBEA) 2025. The recognition comes as DPL enters its 50th year of global operations.

The event was held under the patronage of New Zealand High Commissioner David Pine as Chief Guest, with South African High Commissioner to Sri Lanka and Maldives Sandile Edwin Schalk serving as Guest of Honour.

In addition to the top accolade, DPL secured five further honours: Winner – ‘Extra Large Category,’ Winner ‘Manufacturing (Other Sector),’ ‘Excellence in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG),’ ‘Excellence in Corporate Governance and Strategy,’ and Runner-up – ‘Excellence in Global Market Reach.’

Together, these recognitions underscore DPL’s performance and its pivotal role in driving Sri Lanka’s export competitiveness and sustainable industrial growth. As a key contributor to the Hayleys Group’s export manufacturing business portfolio, DPL has for decades exemplified the Group’s values of resilience, innovation, and purpose-led enterprise.

“This win represents the strength and potential of the Sri Lankan industry on the world stage,” said Dipped Products PLC Managing Director Pushpika Janadheera. “We are proud to be part of a group that is consistently pushing boundaries and proud of our teams who have made this possible through years of relentless focus, even during the most challenging periods.”

DPL is a global supplier of natural and synthetic latex gloves for household, industrial, sports, and medical use, with a presence in over 70 markets. The company is one of Sri Lanka’s most enduring export champions and a leading ethical glove manufacturer. Its ability to cater to global demand, despite pandemic and market disruptions, reflects sustained investments in research and development (R&D), agile manufacturing, and market diversification.

Recently, DPL launched a series of high-value glove innovations that address evolving global market needs, from specialised electric vehicle industry solutions to gloves designed for chemical handling and critical industrial applications. DPL was recently honoured with the Innovative Export Product of the Year award at the 26th Presidential Export Awards, highlighting its future-ready focus.

The company continues to pursue strategic capacity expansions and cutting-edge technology upgrades, integrating advanced automation and robotic dipping processes to further enhance product quality, operational efficiency, and scalability.

Sustainability is central to DPL’s strategy through its DPL Pulse ESG Roadmap, which drives emissions reduction, water conservation, supplier development, and biodiversity protection. The Eco Pulse Nature Reserve on-site exemplifies the harmony between industrial growth and environmental care, alongside investments in solar energy and waste reduction.

“This achievement marks a proud moment for all Sri Lankans invested in the country’s industrial and export future,” Janadheera added. “It is a call to rally behind local manufacturers who are creating long-term value the hard way, by putting in the work, earning global trust, and staying the course.”

This is the second consecutive year that a Hayleys Group company has secured the Overall Gold Award, with Haycarb PLC achieving the top honour in 2024. Reinforcing the Group’s consistent performance across industries, Hayleys Fentons, the flagship projects and engineering services company in the diversified conglomerate’s portfolio, was also recognised with eight awards at this year’s ceremony.
