Sri Lanka’s DFCC Bank to sell Rs10bn GSS+ bond

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s DFCC Bank Plc is planning a 10-year green, social and sustainable (GSS) bond issue to raise 10 billion rupees, it said.

The proposed issue will offer 100 million Basel III compliant, subordinated, listed, rated, unsecured, redeemable GSS+ bonds, with a non-viability conversion option, at 100 rupees each.

The bonds, with a term of up to 10 years, will be issued with annual coupon payments.

The interest rates are to be decided closer to the finalization of the Trust Deed based on the market rates prevailing at that point in time, the bank said.

The issue is subject to receiving necessary regulatory and other approvals.

The bank’s previous green bond issue to raise 2.5 billion rupees was oversubscribed.

GSS bonds fund projects with measurable environmental, social, or sustainability objectives, going further than green bonds which fund eco-friendly projects such as renewable energy and climate adaptation.

Social bonds may fund social challenges like affordable housing and healthcare. (Colombo/Aug10/2024)
