Beyond Hiroshima: The Age of Omnicide

Eighty years have passed, and yet no instrument of war has emerged as absolute, as unrelenting, or as exquisitely engineered for annihilation as the nuclear weapon. Its shadow has loomed over international affairs ever since, petrifying geopolitical strategies and freezing conflicts into perennial standoffs. And yet, while the world reminisces annually on the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, there is a dangerous complacency in the modern imagination. We have failed to reckon with the grotesque escalation of nuclear lethality since 1945, and the global compact once designed to forestall such catastrophe—the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)—has degenerated into ritualistic farce.

The bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki—”Little Boy” and “Fat Man” respectively—released explosive forces of 15 and 21 kilotons of TNT. They razed cities, incinerated tens of thousands in milliseconds, and ushered in an era where man’s ingenuity outstripped his morality. Today, however, those early bombs would be considered antiquated firecrackers. The largest thermonuclear weapons in modern arsenals—such as Russia’s RS-28 Sarmat (“Satan II”) or the US B83—are orders of magnitude more destructive, boasting yields exceeding 50 megatons. The Soviet Tsar Bomba, tested in 1961, yielded a blast so colossal—estimated at 100 megatons before being deliberately scaled down—that windows shattered 900 kilometres away, and the Earth’s crust reportedly oscillated. Humanity is now in possession of bombs that can eradicate not just cities, but civilisations, possibly ecosystems.

In light of this escalatory insanity, what weight does the Non-Proliferation Treaty still carry? Signed in 1968 and entering into force in 1970, the NPT rests on a Faustian bargain: the five recognised nuclear states—the United States, Russia, China, France, and the United Kingdom—would reduce their arsenals over time and not share nuclear technology, while non-nuclear states would forgo acquiring them. Over fifty years later, this regime is threadbare. Nuclear powers have not meaningfully disarmed; instead, they modernise. The US pours hundreds of billions into new delivery systems and warhead refurbishment. Russia flexes novel “doomsday” devices. China, long cautious, is now accelerating its stockpile expansion. Meanwhile, Israel remains an undeclared nuclear power, North Korea an open defector, and Iran an eternal question mark. India and Pakistan, locked in a volatile nuclear rivalry. The treaty’s enforcement mechanisms are toothless, its inspections limited by politics, and its moral authority degraded by hypocrisy.

This is not novel. The declassified record of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings reveals the extent to which nuclear decisions have always been cloaked in subterfuge and moral evasion. The dominant narrative—that the bombs were dropped to end the war quickly and save American lives—has been repeatedly challenged by the United States’ own internal records and the testimonies of its highest military officials. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, later president, confided to his aide Robert Meiklejohn that he had “hoped that the war might have ended without our having to use the atomic bomb.” Admiral William Leahy, President Truman’s Chief of Staff, wrote in his memoirs: “The use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan.” Yet these voices were muffled, their dissent buried under patriotic triumphalism.

The National Security Archive’s compendium of declassified documents show that Japan had already been seeking peace through intermediaries, including the Soviet Union. Intercepted Japanese communications (codenamed “Magic”) revealed that Tokyo was willing to surrender, provided the emperor’s position be preserved. Instead of negotiating, the United States pursued a demonstration of atomic prowess. Gar Alperovitz coined the term “atomic diplomacy” to suggest that the bomb was not merely a tool to end World War II but a geopolitical gambit designed to intimidate the Soviet Union. Indeed, Truman’s diary entry from July 18, 1945—written after learning of the successful Trinity test—boasts: “We’ll have a hammer on those boys.”

Such sentiments do not exist in isolation. The decision to target cities—particularly Hiroshima and Nagasaki, both of which had limited military significance—was informed more by psychological calculus than tactical necessity. Secretary of War Henry Stimson famously struck Kyoto off the target list for cultural reasons, not civilian ones. The rest of the cities remained vulnerable not because they housed factories or command centres, but because they had not yet been bombed with conventional weapons and could thus serve as “clean slates” to measure atomic impact.

The moral gymnastics did not end with the war. The United States government suppressed information about radiation sickness, initially denying its existence. Journalists like Wilfred Burchett who reported on the “atomic plague” were discredited, and Japanese doctors’ research was dismissed. It was only in the decades that followed—through the testimonies of hibakusha (bomb survivors) and brave medical researchers—that the full horror emerged: internal bleeding, skin sloughing off, leukaemia, generational mutations. The bomb didn’t just kill instantly—it sentenced survivors to years of slow, agonising decay.

That legacy continues. Today’s nuclear weapons, particularly thermonuclear warheads, are based not on fission alone, but on fusion—the same reaction that powers the sun. They are not simply bigger bombs; they are different beasts altogether. A single modern hydrogen bomb could vaporise an entire metropolitan area and irradiate hundreds of square kilometres beyond. A full-scale exchange between major powers would plunge the Earth into a nuclear winter, blocking sunlight, collapsing agriculture, and potentially killing billions. We are no longer speaking of war, but omnicide.

And yet, nuclear sabre-rattling has returned with frightening casualness. Russia’s threats over Ukraine, North Korea’s theatre of missile launches, and China’s rising assertiveness bring us to the edge once more. Even in the West, the notion of “usable” tactical nukes is gaining currency—smaller, “cleaner,” more precise. This is delusional. No nuclear detonation can be local. Fallout travels, escalation is inevitable, and the threshold between limited and total war is a fiction.

In 1945, Oppenheimer expressed hope that the terrifying power of the bomb would unite mankind in fear and foster mutual restraint. Instead, we’ve institutionalised it. The nuclear order is not a solution—it is a system of deferred suicide. The NPT, in its current form, merely sanctifies this equilibrium of terror under the guise of legality. It is no longer a tool of peace, but a relic of Cold War idealism, invoked at conferences and summits with the same solemnity as one recites scripture at a wake.

We have built a world where the survival of billions rests on deterrence theory—a gambler’s promise that no leader will miscalculate, no system will glitch, no crisis will spiral. One cannot imagine a more perilous foundation for civilisation. The bombs that fell on Japan were a warning. We chose not to listen. Now, we stand at the abyss, with arsenals capable of ending life as we know it, held together by treaties no longer honoured and trust no longer earned. The question is not whether we remember Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The question is whether we understand that the next bombs will not stop at two.
