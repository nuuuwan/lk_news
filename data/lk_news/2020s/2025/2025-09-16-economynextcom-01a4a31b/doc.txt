Sri Lanka Cabinet proceeds with casino tax amendment

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka Cabinet has approved a 2025 budget proposal to increase levy on betting and gaming as well as to double casino entry fee for locals after clearance from the Attorney General, Cabinet Spokesman Nalinda Jayatissa said.

The 2025 budget proposed to increase of the betting gaming levy on the gross total 18 percent from the current 15 percent while raising the tax imposed for Sri Lankans to enter into Casino USD100 from the current 50.

Media and Health Minister Jayatissa said legal Draftsman has drafted a bill to amend Betting Gaming Levy Act to incorporate the proposals.

“Clearance of the Attorney General too has been granted for the draft bill. The Cabinet of Ministers approved the proposal to publish the draft bill in the government’s gazette notification and subsequently to forward it to the Parliament for its approval,” the Minister said.

The Betting and Gaming Levy Act is the core law in Sri Lanka governing taxes on bookmakers and gaming businesses.

Under the Act, anyone carrying on the business of a bookmaker or any form of gambling or gaming must pay an annual levy. The law includes a “gross collection levy”, a percentage charged on the total turnover or gross receipts of betting and gaming operations.

It also mandates a casino entrance levy, under which individuals entering a gaming facility (like a casino) pay a fixed fee.

In recent years, faced with severe fiscal pressure, Sri Lankan government in its 2025 budget has proposed and in some cases already implemented further changes to the Betting and Gaming Levy Act to raise more revenue.  (Colombo/September 16/2025)
