A global gathering in SL with a focus on food sovereignty and security

Sri Lanka will host the Third Nyéléni Global Forum from September 5 -14, 2025 at the National Institute of Cooperative Development (NICD), Polgolla, Kandy. For the first time since its inception in Mali, the Forum will move outside Africa, drawing over 600 delegates from more than 120 countries, including policymakers, academics, trade unionists, and global agriculture leaders. The agenda will feature, among other things, food security and sovereignty.

This high-profile gathering arrives at a critical juncture for Sri Lanka, as it attempts to restructure an economy battered by the 2022 sovereign default, inflationary spikes, and food insecurity. The government’s reliance on agricultural imports — worth over USD 2.4 billion annually — has exposed vulnerabilities in supply chains, while currency depreciation has made basic staples increasingly unaffordable for millions.

Sri Lanka’s agricultural sector contributes 7.8% of GDP but employs nearly one in four workers, making it a cornerstone of the economy. Yet the country remains highly import-dependent for essentials, including wheat, pulses, sugar, and dairy.

According to Central Bank data, agricultural imports surged from USD 1.9 billion in 2019 to USD 2.7 billion in 2023, even as foreign reserves collapsed. During the peak of the 2022 crisis, food inflation skyrocketed to 94.9%, underscoring the dangers of relying on global markets for staples.

“The Nyéléni Forum is not just about agriculture — it’s about economic resilience, said Hemantha Withanage, chairperson of the Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ). “We need to rethink an economy that prioritises imports and export monocultures while undermining small farmers. Food sovereignty is a financial security strategy as much as a social movement.”

Food security, a long-standing national goal, focuses on access to adequate food. Food sovereignty, however, emphasises domestic control of agricultural production and distribution, empowering communities rather than corporations.

Globally, countries are realising the cost of an over-reliance on agrochemical-intensive monoculture farming. In Sri Lanka, decades of policy favouring export-oriented crops like tea, rubber, and coconut left the island dependent on imports for wheat, lentils, and dairy.

“The financial model of cheap imports collapsed when the rupee depreciated sharply in 2022, Withanage noted. “This is a lesson in economic sovereignty: no amount of foreign reserves can insulate you if your food systems are outsourced.”

Sri Lanka’s seed market illustrates this imbalance. While government agencies control roughly 10% of paddy seed distribution, the private sector dominates most other crops, limiting farmers’ choices and increasing production costs.

“Farmers are paying heavily for seeds and inputs, yet farmgate prices remain low. The seed monopoly and lack of regulation leave small-scale farmers vulnerable, said Chinthaka Rajapakse, Operations Manager of the Movement for Land and Agricultural Reform (MONLAR).

Compounding this are land-use policies that prioritise commercial agriculture and infrastructure projects over smallholder farming. Land acquisition for renewable energy — such as floating solar farms in irrigation reservoirs — is affecting both agriculture and inland fisheries.

“Climate change is magnifying these pressures. Rural farmers face rising debt, unpredictable weather, and shrinking arable land, while agribusiness consolidates resources, Rajapakse added.

Experts argue that agroecology — integrating ecological science into farming practices — offers a competitive advantage for Sri Lanka, particularly as global demand for sustainably produced goods grows.

Agriculture remains a heavily feminised sector in Sri Lanka, with women dominating tea plucking, vegetable farming and informal food markets. Yet their contribution is undervalued, said Gayani Gomez of the Women’s Centre.

“Economic policies are designed around corporations, not communities. The neoliberal system rewards large-scale agribusiness but disempowers the rural women who sustain food systems, she said.

Thilak Kariyawasam, Executive Director of FIAN Sri Lanka, highlighted that lessons from the 2022–23 economic crisis should inform future policy.

“The pandemic and economic collapse revealed that food imports are not a guarantee of security. When currency reserves fell, supermarkets emptied overnight, Kariyawasam said. “The Nyéléni Forum will provide actionable models from across the globe on how to localise supply chains and reduce exposure to currency and commodity shocks.”

As 600 delegates converge on Kandy this month, the message is clear: food sovereignty is no longer a niche ideal but a strategic economic priority. For Sri Lanka, aligning agricultural policy with resilience rather than dependency could mark a turning point in the country’s path to economic stability.
