Sri Lanka calls investors to double refinery capacity as BOT project

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corporation has called expression of interest from private investors to expand its 50,000 barrels per day refinery into 100,000 barrels or to set up an entirely new one in the same premises.

“This Development and Expansion Project represents a strategic opportunity to establish a long-term partnership within Sri Lanka’s energy sector,” the EOI document said.

“It will help strengthen the country’s energy security, reduce dependence on imported refined petroleum products, and enhance overall economic resilience.

“Your organization’s proven expertise in refinery development, infrastructure investment, and energy sector operations positions you as a potential key partner in this significant national initiative.”

The investor will be able to use existing facilities at CPC’s Sapugaskande refinery complex and associated infrastructure.

These include an offshore point buoy mooring system where a 140,000 dead weight tonne tanker could be berthed.

There was total land area of 324 acres including 95 acres of the existing refinery, 106 acres of bare land and 23 acres which are now being acquired and another 100 identified for future acquisition.

The investor is expected to finance the refinery giving a share to CPC for the facility and transfer the plant to CPC at the end of the concession period. (Colombo/Aug08/2025)
