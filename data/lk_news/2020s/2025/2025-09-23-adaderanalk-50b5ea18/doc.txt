Justice Minister to attend first review of Committee on Enforced Disappearances in Geneva

Minister of Justice and National Integration Harsha Nanayakkara is scheduled to depart for Geneva, Switzerland, on Wednesday (24), to participate in the first periodic review of Sri Lanka by the Committee on Enforced Disappearances.

The review session will be held on September 26, and will focus on Sri Lanka’s compliance with the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, which the country became a party to in 2016.

Joining the Justice Minister for the session will be senior officials from the Ministry of Justice and National Unity, the Attorney General’s Department, the Office on Missing Persons (OMP), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Employment and Tourism, and Sri Lanka’s Permanent Mission to Geneva.

The review represents a significant step in Sri Lanka’s engagement with international human rights mechanisms, particularly in addressing issues related to enforced disappearances, a statement from the Ministry of Justice noted.
