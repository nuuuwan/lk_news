Sri Lanka trade body commends new food labelling and advertising regulations

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has imposed restrictions on marketing food and beverages to children, effective January 1, under its Food (Labelling and Advertising) Regulations 2022.

The industry must now ensure children under 12 are not featured in advertisements for F&B products, and F&B products are not advertised or promoted to children below 12 years without prior approval from the Ministry of Health.

Updated food labelling requirements, effective July 1, will provide consumers with essential information, including nutritional values and detailed ingredient lists, to make informed food choices.

These updates address gaps in the regulations established in 2005 and align the framework with international standards, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce said in a statement.

“Transitioning entrenched industry practices will be challenging for businesses, from SMEs to large-scale operators,” CCC CEO Buwanekabahu Perera said.

“However, it is vital to balance consumer protection with the continued availability of packaged food, and preserving longstanding brand equity. A corrective and collaborative approach to implementing these regulations will be important to ensure a smooth transition.”

The Chamber said its Food and Beverage Steering Committee was a key partner in shaping these regulations by providing inputs on food science, nutrition, international regulatory practices, and legal frameworks during an over decade-long consultation process with the Ministry of Health.

“We commend the Ministry of Health for modernising Sri Lanka’s food regulatory framework after 20 years.” (Colombo/Jan3/2025)
