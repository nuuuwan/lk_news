Gem Sri Lanka 2026 launch set for 26 August

The Ceylon Gem and Jewellery Traders Association (CGJTA) announced that the launch of the ‘Gem Sri Lanka 2026’ international expo will take place on 26 August at the Lotus Ballroom of Shangri-La Colombo.

The international gem and jewellery exhibition, now in its third edition, will be held on 7-9 January 2026, at Shangri-La Colombo. Organised under the theme ‘The Source. The Production. The Selection’, the event will showcase Sri Lanka’s position as a leading origin of high-quality gemstones.

Following the 2024 and 2025 editions, which attracted global collectors, traders, and connoisseurs, the 2026 exhibition will feature upgraded exhibitor services and improved visitor facilities. CGJTA said the show aims to provide an immersive experience for international and local participants, while highlighting the full journey of Sri Lankan gems from mine to market.

As Sri Lanka’s largest gem trade body, CGJTA represents professionals across the industry and is custodian of the Chinafort Beruwala Gem Market, the oldest and largest open-air gem market in the world. Through the exhibition, the association seeks to strengthen the local trade, expand export potential, and reinforce Sri Lanka’s reputation in the global gemstone industry.

Gem Sri Lanka is now considered a regular fixture in the international gem calendar, offering business opportunities, networking, and a platform to promote the heritage of Sri Lanka’s gemstone sector, CGJTA said.
