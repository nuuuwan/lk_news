US Ambassador Julie Chung says delegation seeking cooperation in governance, trade and security

US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung yesterday said a delegation of bipartisan Congressional staffers from the United States was in Sri Lanka to explore opportunities for cooperation in governance, trade and security.

Ambassador Chung said the visit is part of ongoing engagement, with meetings scheduled with Parliamentarians, civil society groups and senior Government officials to exchange views on strengthening democratic practices.

She added that the House Democracy Partnership, a bipartisan initiative of the US Congress, supports legislatures worldwide in promoting accountability and transparency, and contributes to advancing economic growth, regional security and international cooperation.
