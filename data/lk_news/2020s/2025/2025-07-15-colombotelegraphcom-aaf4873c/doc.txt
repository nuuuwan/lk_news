Undermining  SJB’s Leadership: A Nation’s Struggle For Progressive Politics

Sri Lanka stands at a critical juncture, three years after the historic 2022 ‘Aragalaya’ (uprising), which ousted President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The uprising was a powerful reminder of the people’s capacity to challenge entrenched power structures. Yet, today, the landscape is rife with political maneuvering, ideological contradictions, malicious campaigns and fake news —particularly against the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and its leader, Sajith Premadasa.

Amidst the turmoil, right-wing neoliberals and Marxist hardliners continue to fan the flames of division, undermining efforts for a unified, progressive political future. The question remains: when will these factions learn the lessons of history?

Sri Lanka’s political history is replete with hypocritical alliances and marriages of convenience. One need only recall the JVP’s partnership with Chandrika Kumaratunga’s administration—a paradoxical arrangement given the JVP’s violent history, including the assassination of progressive leaders like Vijaya Kumaratunga.

Fast forward to today, the National People’s Power (NPP)—an offshoot of the JVP—has positioned itself for national leadership. However, its actions, much like those of the UNP under Ranil Wickremesinghe, reveal a willingness to prioritize power over principles. The NPP’s promises of change have left voters disillusioned, as its leadership struggles to deliver meaningful reforms or articulate a coherent vision for the future.

At the center of this political theater is Ranil Wickremesinghe, a veteran politician whose career has been defined by opportunism. Despite his lackluster leadership of the UNP, Wickremesinghe has maneuvered himself into a position of power, even becoming a guarantor of the current regime. His unwillingness to cede the political stage to Sajith Premadasa, a leader with genuine popular support, speaks volumes about his insecurities.

Wickremesinghe’s actions during the 2022 presidential election were particularly revealing. By framing the contest as a choice between himself and NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, he sought to undermine Premadasa’s candidacy. This strategy not only exposed his own political desperation but also highlighted his refusal to acknowledge Premadasa’s potential as a transformative leader.

In stark contrast to Wickremesinghe’s self-serving politics, Sajith Premadasa has emerged as a principled and visionary leader. As a champion of social democracy, Premadasa has consistently demonstrated his commitment to the people’s welfare. His policies prioritize economic justice, social equality, and diplomatic integrity—a refreshing departure from the transactional politics of his rivals.

Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka, one of Sri Lanka’s foremost political scientists, has described Premadasa in his Financial Times column of 10th July 2025, as the most enlightened political leader in the country today. This endorsement underscores Premadasa’s potential to lead Sri Lanka out of its current crisis and restore its dignity on the global stage.

The media, often manipulated by political interests, has played a significant role in perpetuating misinformation about the SJB and its leadership, while SJB remains strongly committed to liberal values inspiring internal criticism and debate over strategies and policies. Recent reports suggesting dissatisfaction within the SJB over Premadasa’s leadership are baseless fabrications, likely orchestrated by Wickremesinghe’s allies. These narratives not only undermine Premadasa’s credibility but also distract from the urgent need for progressive governance.

It is noteworthy that the SJB remains united in its support for Premadasa. As a member of the SJB Working Committee, I can confidently affirm that the party recognizes his unwavering commitment to the principles of social democracy and his ability to navigate Sri Lanka’s complex challenges.

Under Premadasa’s leadership, the SJB has articulated a foreign policy rooted in positive alignment. This approach emphasizes mutual respect and national interest, in stark contrast to the current regime’s opaque dealings with foreign powers. Premadasa’s vision is inspired by his father, former President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who championed the rights of oppressed peoples worldwide.

The elder Premadasa’s decision to expel the Israeli Interest Section from Sri Lanka, in solidarity with the Palestinian cause, exemplifies the values that guide his son’s leadership. Sajith Premadasa’s commitment to these ideals is evident in his efforts to engage constructively with international lending agencies and advocate for policies that uplift the poorest segments of society.

One of Premadasa’s most significant contributions has been his opposition to policies that harm the most vulnerable. From resisting the implementation of Parate laws to challenging the privatization of the Sir John Kotelawala Defence University, he has consistently stood on the side of the people.

His appeals to global leaders as Opposition Leader, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, demonstrate his diplomatic acumen and commitment to securing Sri Lanka’s economic future.

Premadasa’s leadership has also been instrumental in exposing the current regime’s failures, such as its mishandling of controversial container releases and its inability to meaningfully address tariff disputes with the United States. These actions underscore his determination to hold the government accountable and protect the interests of ordinary Sri Lankans.

As the SJB works as the country’s main Parliamentary Opposition, it is actively reforming its structure to better serve the people. The party’s ideological foundation as a social democratic alternative positions it as the most viable option for progressive governance. Unlike the NPP or the UNP, the SJB under Premadasa’s leadership offers a vision of unity, dignity, and justice for all Sri Lankans.

The SJB’s approach is not about seizing power at any cost but about earning the trust and respect of the people. This commitment to ethical governance sets it apart in a political landscape dominated by opportunism and deception.

Sri Lanka is at a crossroads, and the choices made today will shape its future for generations to come. The SJB, under Sajith Premadasa’s leadership, represents the best hope for a nation yearning for progress and stability. It is time for Sri Lankans to reject the divisive tactics of right-wing neoliberals and Marxist hardliners and rally behind a leader who embodies their aspirations.

As we navigate these challenging times, let us remember the lessons of history and strive to build a brighter, more equitable future. The SJB stands ready to lead the way—with integrity, vision, and an unwavering commitment to the people.
