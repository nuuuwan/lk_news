Sri Lanka to look for investors to set up Customs point at Kerawalapitiya

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is looking for private investors to set up a Customs inspection center at Kerawalapitiya as a public-private partnership, minister Nalinda Jayatissa said.

A land belonging to the Sri Lanka Land Development Corporation has been transferred to the Sri Lanka Customs for this purpose, he told reporters.

A committee appointed to determine the methodology for the establishment of the center has submitted its recommendations for selecting a viable business model.

“Based on its recommendation, the Cabinet approved the proposal to call for expressions of interest and requests for proposals to select a suitable private partner to implement the proposed Kerawalapitiya Customs Verification Center project under a hybrid public-private partnership model,” Jayatissa said.
