Voyage Sri Lanka 2025 to focus on boosting blue economy

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will host its international marine summit, Voyage Sri Lanka 2025, in October, with a focus on boosting the island nation’s blue economy, its Export Development Board (EDB) said.

This year’s event will have a “sharper focus on turning Sri Lanka’s blue economy potential into tangible outcomes,” EDB said.

The keynote address will focus on the nation’s marine future, EDB said, with three panel discussions exploring the opportunities for the island’s marine economy:

– Trincomalee as the Strategic Gateway to Sri Lanka’s Blue Economy

– Energizing Sri Lanka’s Blue Economy: Offshore Oil & Gas Exploration and LNG Infrastructure as Economic Game Changers

– Charting a Course for Growth: Synergizing Boat Building and Nautical Tourism for Sri Lanka’s Blue Economy

“Complementing these discussions will be boat displays showcasing the craftsmanship and innovation of Sri Lanka’s world-class boatbuilding industry, as well as networking sessions designed to connect stakeholders through B2B meetings, investor roundtables, and targeted matchmaking opportunities.”

The second edition of Voyage Sri Lanka 2025 will be held on October 16, at The Kingsbury Hotel, Colombo, and bring together government policymakers, industry leaders, global investors, academia, and innovators.
