Ex-IGP Deshabandu remanded till 27 August

Former Inspector General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Thennakoon was remanded till 27 August after being produced before the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court yesterday over his alleged role in the violent crackdown on peaceful protesters at Galle Face on 9 May 2022.

Thennakoon, who was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Wednesday evening, appeared before Magistrate Nilupuli Lankapura.

Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) Wasantha Perera told the Court that Thennakoon, serving as the Western Province Senior Deputy Inspector General (DIG) at the time, failed to act despite clear opportunities to prevent the attack on the “Aragalaya” protest movement.

It was revealed in Court that Thennakoon had instructed officers not to intervene till his orders were given, even as about 2,000 armed individuals assaulted unarmed civilians. The prosecution argued that this amounted to aiding and abetting the attackers.

The DSG further informed the Court that statements are yet to be recorded from the former President and several senior Police officers. Magistrate Lankapura ordered that these statements be obtained within the coming week.

Following submissions, Thennakoon was ordered to be remanded till 27 August.
