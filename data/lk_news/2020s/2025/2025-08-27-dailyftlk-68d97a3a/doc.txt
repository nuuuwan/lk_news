Elevating construction excellence: Würth Lanka hosts Engineering Forum on anchors and construction fixings

In its ongoing mission to advance Sri Lanka’s built environment, Würth Lanka Ltd., recently convened the Würth Lanka Engineering Forum 2025—a landmark gathering of leading civil engineers, structural consultants, and industry innovators from across the country. Under the banner “Elevating Construction Excellence,” the one-day event showcased cutting edge German engineered anchor systems and construction fixing solutions designed to raise safety, efficiency, and quality standards across local infrastructure projects.

Despite the lingering after effects of market volatility and the pressures of rapid urban development, Würth Lanka has continued its trajectory of robust growth—achieving an impressive 64% increase in turnover in June 2025 compared to June 2024, underscoring its strong market position and sustained performance. This success reflects the company’s strategic expansion of its product portfolio, the launch of its new ‘Trade’ division, and its commitment to nurturing local talent—all hallmarks of the change management journey led by Managing Director and CEO Suranga Kekuluwalage.

The Forum’s centrepiece session featured Dr. Jochen Bühler, a globally recognised expert on anchor technology from Germany, whose presentation on the latest trends, testing protocols, and best practices in construction fixings captivated attendees. Drawing on decades of research and field experience, Dr. Bühler demonstrated how innovative resin anchors, high load steel fixings, and corrosion resistant systems can dramatically improve the durability and safety of concrete and masonry structures. His insights will empower Sri Lankan professionals to specify the right solutions for seismic resilience, high rise developments, and critical infrastructure projects.

Reflecting on the Forum, Kekuluwalage said, “By bringing together top minds from Sri Lanka’s engineering community and world class experts like Dr. Bühler, we are fostering the knowledge exchange that drives true innovation. Würth Lanka’s commitment extends beyond supplying premium products—we aim to equip our industry partners with the technical expertise and support they need to build a stronger, safer future for our nation.”

Throughout the day, participants engaged in hands on demonstrations of advanced anchoring techniques, panel discussions on project specific case studies, and interactive Q&A sessions—cementing Würth Lanka’s role as both a supplier and a strategic partner in Sri Lanka’s construction sector. The Forum concluded with a networking reception, where professionals and technical specialists explored opportunities to integrate German engineered solutions into upcoming landmark developments.

As part of the global Würth Group—whose 2023 sales exceeded EUR 20 billion—Würth Lanka continues to blend international R&D leadership with local market understanding. Through initiatives like the Engineering Forum, the company reaffirms its promise to deliver world class products, deepen technical collaboration, and drive sustainable growth within Sri Lanka’s construction industry.
