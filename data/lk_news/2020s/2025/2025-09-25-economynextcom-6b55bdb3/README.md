# Sri Lanka weddings promoted to Indian couples

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka Tourism has conducted promotions in India’s Mumbai, Ahmedabad, and Delhi, to market the island as an ‘enchanting’ wedding destination for Indian couples.

The campaign attracted leading wedding planners, event managers, travel agents, and media representatives.

Destination weddings continue to be a trend among Indian families seeking international venues that combine cultural richness, Sri Lanka Tourism said in a statement.

“Recognizing this demand, Sri Lanka Tourism presented the island’s unique offerings – from golden beaches and luxury resorts to romantic hill country escapes, heritage sites, and spiritual backdrops.”

“If marriages are made in heaven, then surely they deserve to be celebrated in paradise. Sri Lanka is that paradise – offering golden beaches, romantic hill country retreats, and heritage estates where Indian couples can create memories that last a lifetime,” Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau said.

The events featured business networking sessions between Sri Lankan service providers and Indian industry leaders, discussions on wedding logistics, packages, and cultural compatibility.

Sri Lanka Tourism plans similar promotions in other Indian cities, and will offer familiarization tours for wedding planners, and develop customized wedding packages tailored to Indian cultural and traditional requirements.

Discussions will also be had to explore direct flight connectivity from Ahmedabad to Colombo, improving accessibility for wedding travelers. (Colombo/Sep25/2025)
