Visa presents ‘India on a Plate’: An exclusive dining experience for Infinite cardholders

Visa, the global leader in digital payments, curated a one-of-a-kind dining experience called ‘India on a Plate’ exclusively for its Visa Infinite cardholders, held in collaboration with Cinnamon Life at Indiya Restaurant. This specially designed Chef’s Table experience, hosted on 25th July 2025, exemplified Visa’s commitment to deliver an infinite lifestyle rooted in culturally immersive moments for its indulgent, affluent cardholders.

Facilitated by the skillful and renowned Indian Chef Bhairav Singh, the event transported guests on a sensorial journey through India’s rich culinary heritage. The four-course dinner was an infusion of regional flavours from Bihar, Lucknow, Goa, Kerala, and more; each dish paired with Chef Bhairav’s live storytelling and personal insights deepened the experience. From a delicately plated Gujarati Amuse Bouche to the bold richness of Kashmiri Kukur Rogan Josh, the menu was both nostalgic and inventive.

‘India on a Plate’ is part of the long-curated experiences under Visa Infinite Privileges programme, which offers discerning cardholders access to dining, retail, exclusive travel, and other lifestyle experiences across the globe. This exclusive gathering in Colombo reflects Visa’s ongoing efforts to deliver locally relevant, globally inspired value to its Infinite customers.
