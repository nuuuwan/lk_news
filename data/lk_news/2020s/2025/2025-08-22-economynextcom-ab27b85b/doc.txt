Wickremesinghe revived Sri Lanka’s economy: former minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Ex-President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s leadership revived Sri Lanka’s economy, former state minister of finance Shehan Semasinghe has said.

“Without his guidance & leadership, overcoming the economic crisis would not have been possible,” Semasinghe said on X.

“More importantly, essential structural and economic reforms were implemented, and the most challenging debt restructuring was successfully completed, firmly placing the country on a path toward a stronger and more stable economy for the betterment of people of Sri Lanka.”

Wickremesinghe is at a bail hearing at Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court, after being arrested following a questioning.

The arrest was over an alleged misappropriation of funds during a foreign visit while he was president.
