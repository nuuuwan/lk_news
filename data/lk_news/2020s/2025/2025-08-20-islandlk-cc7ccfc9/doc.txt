CEAT extends premium ‘S-I-S’ retail experience to Kelaniya and Horana

Sri Lanka’s top tyre brand CEAT has extended its premium retail experience to Kelaniya and Horana, with the opening of new-concept Shop-in-Shop (SIS) outlets in these bustling towns.

The 11th and 12th CEAT SIS outlets in Sri Lanka are located at Jayantha Tyre Traders at No 408, Kandy Road, Kelaniya and at Lal Tyre House at No 243, Panadura – Anguruwatota Road, Horana, providing vehicle owners in these areas an exclusive and premium purchase experience.

These outlets will offer an extensive range of CEAT tyres with attractive discounts, tyre care and technical expertise, as well as a combination of services such as wheel balancing and alignment, nitrogen and air pumps for tyre inflation, alloy wheels and automobile batteries. A distinctive feature of every CEAT SIS outlet is its own customer lounge.

Part of a distribution channel expansion strategy by Sri Lanka’s highest-selling tyre brand, the CEAT Shop-in-Shop concept is designed to drive brand premiumisation and enhance customer experience, and entails demarcating a dedicated area for CEAT branded tyres within existing multi-brand dealer premises.
