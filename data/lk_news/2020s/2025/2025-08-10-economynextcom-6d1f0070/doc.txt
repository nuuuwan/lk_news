Sri Lanka in talks on a voluntary restructure of some residual 2022 ISBs

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is in talks to restructure some defaulted 2022 bonds which did not participate in the original restructure in December 2024, a Treasury statement issued after an investor call said.

A holdout investor, Hamilton Reserve Bank claimed to hold 25 percent stake and has gone to court seeking full payment of the 2022 bonds, which have a so-called single series collective action clause.

“Certain holders of the 2022 Bonds who did not participate to the Exchange Offer have come forward to achieve a settlement in line with the Exchange Offer’s Most Favored Creditor Clause, and discussions are currently ongoing,” the statement said.

“The Government plans to finalize and implement restructuring agreements with all parties in the coming months, in line with its commitments to the IMF debt sustainability targets and the Comparability of Treatment principles.”

Exchange of the 2022 bond was voluntary and the court case is still ongoing.

Discussions are also ongoing with two commercial banks, the total of which amounts to around 50 million US dollars.

Authorities are also in talks to restructure a 175 million dollar sovereign guaranteed bond issued by SriLankan Airlines. (Colombo/Aug10/2025)
