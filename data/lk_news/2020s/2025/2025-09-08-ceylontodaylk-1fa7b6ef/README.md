Police have submitted the blood sample of the bus driver involved in last Thursday’s (4) fatal accident on the Ella–Wellawaya road to the Government Analyst’s Department to determine whether he had consumed alcohol prior to the crash.

The accident occurred on Thursday night (4) near the 24th milepost when a bus veered off the road and plunged into a precipice. Fifteen people were killed, including the driver, while 17 others sustained injuries.

According to the Police, the blood sample was handed over to the Government Analyst yesterday (7). Investigators are seeking to establish whether the driver had consumed alcohol or any other intoxicating substances at the time of the tragedy.

Among the dead were 12 employees of the Tangalle Municipal Council. Their remains have since been released to relatives, and funeral rites are expected to be held today.

Meanwhile, 11 of the injured are still receiving treatment at the Badulla Teaching Hospital. Dr. Palitha Rajapaksha, a senior hospital official, confirmed that medical staff are continuing to provide urgent care to the victims.
