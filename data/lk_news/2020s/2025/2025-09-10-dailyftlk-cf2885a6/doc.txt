Sri Lankan citizens in Nepal safe amid unrest

Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism Acting Minister Arun Hemachandra yesterday said no Sri Lankan was reported harmed in Nepal in light of the violent unrest unfolding in Kathmandu and other parts of the country.

Hemachandra said he had personally spoken with members of the Sri Lankan community in Nepal to check on their safety and wellbeing.

There are 22 Sri Lankan students in Nepal and a total of 99 nationals, including Embassy staff and residents. “Our Embassy has established WhatsApp groups and circulated emergency contact numbers to remain in close touch with everyone,” he said.

The Minister said he had advised Sri Lankans to remain indoors, avoid protest areas, and strictly follow curfew measures. He added that the Government of Sri Lanka stands ready to provide further assistance, including evacuation, if necessary.

Hemachandra also commended the work of the Embassy. “I wish to express my deep appreciation to our Chargé d’Affaires and mission staff in Kathmandu for their tireless work and dedication at this critical moment. Their commitment has been vital in keeping our citizens safe and informed,” he said.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism said it will continue to closely monitor developments and act to protect Sri Lankans overseas.
