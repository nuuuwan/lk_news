Hayleys enters into ‘Mobility’ with exclusive OMODA & JAECOO EVs & Hybrids

Hayleys Mobility, the newest venture under Hayleys Fentons, has officially entered the electric and hybrid vehicle market through an exclusive distribution partnership with OMODA & JAECOO Automobile Co., Ltd, the premium NEV brand of Chery Automobile Co., Limited.

The agreement grants Hayleys Mobility full franchise rights in Sri Lanka for OMODA & JAECOO. Chery has been the leader in China’s passenger vehicle exports for more than 22 years, reinforcing its standing as a global automotive powerhouse. The agreement was formalised at Chery’s global headquarters in Wuhu, China.

Hayleys Mobility introduces structure, scale and assurance, delivering premium EVs, Hybrids and conventional vehicle models with regulatory clarity and factory-certified service. Complementing this, its partnership with StarCharge lays the groundwork for a nationwide fast-charging network, tackling one of Sri Lanka’s biggest barriers to EV adoption: accessible, reliable charging.
