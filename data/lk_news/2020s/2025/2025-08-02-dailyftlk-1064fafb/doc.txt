Sajith and Harsha weigh in on US tariff reduction

Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa urges Government to field team of trade economists and experienced negotiators to bring tariff down to 15%

SJB MP Dr. Harsha de Silva glad US tariff is down to 20%, calls for serious work to build bridges with the world

Main Opposition party Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Leader Sajith Premadasa yesterday welcomed the United States’ decision to reduce tariffs on Sri Lankan exports to 20%. In a message posted on X, he argued that Sri Lanka should push for a further reduction to 15% to boost its export competitiveness. “This puts us on par with Vietnam and Bangladesh, while India pays 25%,” he said. “A rate under 15% would give our exporters a real lift. We should field a team of trade economists and experienced negotiators to keep pressing forward.”

SJB MP Dr. Harsha de Silva also responded to the announcement, attributing the outcome to efforts on both sides. “Glad that US tariffs on Sri Lankan exports are at 20%. We can continue to be regionally competitive,” he wrote on X. “Credit goes to all who worked on it on the Sri Lankan side, both seen and unseen, and appreciation to the US Trade Representative for understanding our limitations. Let’s now seriously work on breaking down the walls around us and building bridges to the world.”
