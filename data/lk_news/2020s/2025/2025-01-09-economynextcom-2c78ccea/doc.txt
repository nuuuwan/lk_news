Sri Lanka stocks down on financials; foreign outflows continue

ECONOMYNEXT –  Sri Lanka stock market fell on Thursday led by financial stocks amid continued foreign selling, data on its site showed.

The risky assets are on market  correction after the key All Share Price Index (ASPI) repeatedly touched fresh peak from mid December following the conclusion of Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring

The broader ASPI closed down 0.89 percent or 142.65 points at 15,811.36; while the more liquid S&P SL20 Index closed down 1.26 percent or 27.12  points at 4,816.10.

Banks and other financial stocks dragged the market, the data showed.

The market witnessed foreign outflow for the third straight session. Offshore investors sold a net 37 million rupee worth stocks on Thursday (09), extending the total outflow in the last three straight sessions to 315 million rupees.

Analysts say the turnover is high as more investors are shifting their fixed deposits to stocks after President Anura Kumara Dissanayake doubled withholding tax on interest income. Returns on stock investments are tax free.

Top contributors to the fall of the ASPI were Sampath Bank (1.7% down to 113.50), Commercial Bank (fell 1.8% to 138.00) Melstacrop (down 1.8% to 122.75), DFCC Bank (fell 3.3% to 109.75) and LOLC (down 1.6% to 667.75) (Colombo/Jan9/2025)
