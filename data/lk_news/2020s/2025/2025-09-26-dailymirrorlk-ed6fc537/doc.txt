Parliament kitchen needs minor repairs: MP

Opposition MP Prasad Siriwardana, who was on an inspection tour of the Parliament kitchen on Thursday, said it needs minor repairs.

The MP said six stoves are out of order while the freezer room needs a renovation.

However, the MP said the Speaker's claim that the kitchen is infested with rats and cockroaches is false as all windows are covered with metal meshes and glass.
