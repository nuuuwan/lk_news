Sri Lanka to look for investors to develop Kahatagaha graphite mine

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will look for investors to explore the graphite reserve of its Kahatagaha mine, and to mine, process, and add value to the graphite, under a public-private partnership, minister Nalinda Jayatissa said.

“The locally available technology is not sufficient to determine the reserve of the graphite in the mine,” Jayatissa told reporters.

“Taking these matters into consideration, the cabinet approved the proposal to call for proposals for expressions of interest.”

The Kahatagaha mine is currently operated by the wholly government-owned company, Kahatagaha Graphite Lanka Limited, which produces and exports graphite.

“The government will retain ownership and secure the jobs of the employees currently working in the mine.”

The mine, which spans an area of about 102 acres, is the deepest graphite mine in Sri Lanka.

The cabinet of ministers had decided to repeal a previous government decision to restructure Kahatagaha Graphite Lanka Limited through an identified investor, he said. (Colombo/Sep16/2025)
