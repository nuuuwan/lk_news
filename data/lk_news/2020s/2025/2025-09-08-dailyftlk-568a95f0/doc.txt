JW.ORG’s Colombo International Convention generates $ 7.6 m revenue, welcomes 3,500 delegates

The Jehovah’s Witnesses (JW.ORG) yesterday said that its three-day International Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses, held from 5-7 September at the Sugathadasa Indoor and Outdoor Stadium, concluded successfully, bringing together more than 3,500 international delegates from 10 countries and over 14,000 total participants, including local members.

JW.ORG said in a statement: “The convention delivered a significant boost to Sri Lanka’s tourism and hospitality sector. Based on visitor turnout and extended travel itineraries, organisers estimate the event generated $ 7.6 million in direct tourism revenue. This impact follows the precedent of a similar JW.ORG gathering in 2018 that contributed $ 6.9 million to the local economy.”

International attendees representing the US, Greece, Japan, Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines, India, the Czech Republic, and Nepal stayed across more than 12 luxury hotels in Colombo, with many extending their travel to destinations including Galle, Pinnawala, Yala National Park, and Nuwara Eliya.

Speaking at the conclusion of the convention, Secretary to the Prime Minister Pradeep Saputhanthri said: “This convention has demonstrated how Sri Lanka can successfully host events of international scale, while simultaneously strengthening our tourism economy. The collaboration between organisers, Government agencies, and the hospitality sector has been seamless, and the benefits will be felt well beyond Colombo.”

A senior tourism industry spokesperson added: “The Jehovah’s Witnesses are exemplary visitors—peaceful, well-organised, and highly respectful. Their presence not only boosted hotel occupancy and revenue but also helped position Sri Lanka as a welcoming destination for global faith-based travel.”

The three-day program featured spiritual discourses, video presentations, and panel discussions, all aimed at promoting love, compassion, and community unity, hallmarks of JW.ORG’s mission worldwide.

With more than 8.5 million members globally, the Jehovah’s Witnesses hold such conventions across continents each year, combining spiritual enrichment with meaningful economic contributions to host cities.

The successful Colombo event is expected to encourage further opportunities for Sri Lanka to attract large-scale religious and cultural gatherings, bolstering both international goodwill and the nation’s ongoing tourism recovery.
