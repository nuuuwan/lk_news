Doing the Presley scene in style …

The King of Rock ‘n’ Roll, Elvis Presley, left this world on 16th August, 1977, and that’s 48 years ago. However, for his much-devoted fans, Elvis is still alive and his memory lives on through songs sung by Elvis Tribute Artists across the world.

Sri Lanka-born Lorensz Francke is one huge Elvis fan and is very much in the spotlight, on a regular basis, doing his Elvis Presley scene in Canada, where he is now based, and, what’s more, he is also the recipient of two Spirit of Elvis awards.

Lorensz was in touch with me, from Toronto, Canada, last week, and provided me with an updat.

He said 2025 has turned out to be another busy year for him, with so many performances in Ontario.

On 25th July, in Toronto, Lorensz performed the wedding vows for a young couple, followed by the fun Elvis Vegas-style vows, and, thereafter, entertained the guests with all the much-loved Elvis songs.

Lorensz mentioned that he has been busy performing at events, including Wheels on the Danforth Car Show, and at several parties, and he mainly enjoys bringing a smile to the Seniors performing at all the Long-Term Care homes.

These people love Elvis and Lorensz is well accepted and they truly appreciate his performance and the entertainment he provides and requests him back again … and again!

The Presley scene by Lorensz is in addition to his busy full-time job as a banker.

Lorensz indicated that his calendar is already booked for the upcoming months and Christmas 2025.

He also mentioned that he misses the people of Sri Lanka and looks forward to his next visit to Colombo.
