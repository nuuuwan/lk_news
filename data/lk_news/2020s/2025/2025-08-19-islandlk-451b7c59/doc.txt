GP Certified – paves way for certified plastic recycling

Transforming Sri Lanka’s plastic recycling industry requires bold leadership and collaboration. GP Certified has partnered with pioneering recyclers and FMCG brands who are championing the certification process through pilot programs. These early adopters – “Champions of Change” – are setting the foundation for the country’s transition to a more sustainable and profitable plastic waste management system.

The Champions of Change include leading recyclers who are refining their processes to meet GP Certified standards and FMCG companies committed to integrating certified recycled plastics into their packaging. Their participation in the pilot phase is instrumental in testing and refining the certification process, ensuring that it is both rigorous and practical for industry-wide adoption.

‘At Royal Plastics, we are committed to producing high-quality packaging that meets both local and international standards. Gaining GP Certification for our recycling operation is a key step in demonstrating our dedication to transparency, safety, and sustainability. It gives our clients confidence in the quality of the recycled plastics we use and helps us position ourselves as a trusted supplier to FMCG Companies. – Chanuka Perera, CEO, Royal Plastic Company [Pvt] Ltd.
