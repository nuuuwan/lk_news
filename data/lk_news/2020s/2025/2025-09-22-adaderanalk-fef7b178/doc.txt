The items were discovered buried in a plot of land in Middeniya, the Police Media Spokesman stated.

Investigations revealed that these firearms and ammunition were reportedly provided to Sampath Manamperi by underworld figure ‘Backhoe Saman’ around two months ago.

The Walasmulla Magistrate’s Court on September 17 granted the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) permission to detain Sampath Manamperi for seven days for questioning. He is accused of concealing two containers of raw materials reportedly used in the production of the drug ‘Ice,’ allegedly belonging to underworld figure Kehelbaddara Padme.

Following the court order, PNB officers are questioning Sampath Manamperi regarding the recent discovery of the two containers in Middeniya.

Sampath Manamperi had surrendered to the Walasmulla Magistrate’s Court on September 17.
