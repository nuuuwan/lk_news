Sri Lanka’s President visits Katchatheevu Island after Indian actor’s remarks

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s President Anura Dissanayake has visited Katchatheevu Island, while on a visit to Jaffna to open a fishing harbour, cricket stadium and a Immigration and Emigration regional office.

The visit follows remarks made by C Joseph Vijay, an Indian actor-turned-regional politician from Tamil Nadu, on reclaiming the island.

“The government is committed to safeguarding the surrounding seas, islands and landmass of the country for the benefit of the people and will not allow any external force to exert influence in this regard,” Dissanayake was quoted as saying by his media division.

On August 21, Vijay said India needed to “retrieve Katchatheevu from Sri Lanka” at a political rally in Madurai.

Katchatheevu Island, famous for its annual St Anthony’s festival, was ceded to Sri Lanka by India without consulting the Tamil Nadu state government.

Since then, Indian fishermen have only been allowed to use the island for resting, drying their nets and for the annual church feast, but not for fishing.

Sri Lanka and India signed four Maritime Boundary Agreements between 1974 and 1976 that defined a mutual understanding of the international maritime boundary between the two countries. (Colombo/Sep2/2025)
