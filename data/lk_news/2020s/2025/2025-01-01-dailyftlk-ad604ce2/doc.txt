Cabinet clears amendment to Electricity Act to ensure sustainable power

The Cabinet of Ministers at its meeting on Monday approved reviewing and amending the Sri Lanka Electricity Act No. 36 of 2024 in response to concerns raised by stakeholders regarding its effectiveness in achieving the intended objectives.

Since its implementation on 27 June 2024, various parties have pointed out that the provisions of the Act as well as the roles and responsibilities of proposed institutions may fall short of creating a secure, sustainable and efficient power sector.

“Acknowledging these concerns the Cabinet decided to reconsider the Act’s objectives,” Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said yesterday.

Speaking at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing, he said to facilitate this, a Committee comprising key stakeholders and experts in the field of power and energy will be appointed.

“The Committee is tasked to compile a comprehensive study of the existing Act and submit the recommendations for amendments that address the identified shortcomings,” he added.

He asserted that the review will aim to incorporate feedback from all relevant stakeholders, including policy specialists to ensure the establishment of a sustainable and robust electricity sector.

“The ultimate goal is to ensure uninterrupted, sustainable and affordable electricity supply for everyone,” Dr. Jayatissa said.
