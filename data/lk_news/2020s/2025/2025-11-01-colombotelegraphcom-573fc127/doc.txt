Jaffna Rising: From Lonely Planet’s No. 2 To The World’s Next Great Destination

When Lonely Planet named Jaffna the second-best destination in the world for 2026, it wasn’t a surprise to anyone who has walked along the city’s sun-drenched causeways or shared a crab curry under the shadow of the historic fort. For decades, Jaffna has been a hidden gem — quietly rebuilding, rediscovering, and revealing a side of Sri Lanka that is both ancient and refreshingly new.

But if Sri Lanka wants Jaffna to become the No. 1 travel destination in the world next year, one step is obvious: connect Jaffna properly to the rest of the country through direct flights from Colombo.

Today, travelling between Colombo and Jaffna is an endurance test. The road journey takes 8–10 hours on congested highways, often longer during holidays or heavy transport seasons. Yet the flight time is barely 60 minutes.

The difference is not just about time; it’s about accessibility, comfort, and the quality of experience. Thousands of visitors — especially from the Sri Lankan diaspora — arrive each month at Bandaranaike International Airport (CMB) hoping to visit their ancestral towns in the North. Many are elderly parents, young families, or short-stay professionals. For them, a direct connection to Jaffna International Airport (JAF/Palaly) would transform the journey from a tiring ordeal into a seamless experience.

Reliable connecting flights would also open Jaffna to the hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists now arriving in Sri Lanka. In 2025 alone, tourist arrivals grew by more than 25 percent, with visa-free entry now extended to citizens of 35 countries. If even a fraction of these visitors could add a two-day Jaffna stay to their itineraries, the Northern Province would see an economic revival unlike any since independence.

Lonely Planet’s editors praised Jaffna for its rich heritage, island adventures, and authentic Tamil cuisine, calling it one of the world’s most exciting emerging travel destinations. It is a recognition not only of beauty, but of resilience — a symbol of a region opening its arms to the world after years of isolation.

With this global spotlight, Jaffna’s potential is enormous. But to translate that attention into sustainable growth, connectivity is key. The airport upgrade already underway — a new Rs 600 million terminal and proposed runway extension — is the perfect moment for decisive action by the Civil Aviation Authority and the government.

• Introduce 3–4 daily flights between Colombo and Jaffna using 30–70-seat turboprop aircraft.

• Synchronise schedules with international flight arrivals and departures at CMB for easy same-day transfers.

• Offer through-ticketing with major airlines so that passengers from London, Toronto, or Melbourne can book to Jaffna directly.

• Create flexible fares for diaspora, local residents, and tourists to ensure affordability.

• Promote integrated tourism packages linking Jaffna with Trincomalee, Mannar, Delft Island, and the Northern coastal circuit.

Jaffna has already captured the imagination of the world. The Lonely Planet recognition is not a finish line — it’s an invitation to rise higher. With proper air connectivity, Jaffna could easily leap from second to first place on future world-travel lists, showcasing Sri Lanka not only as a land of beaches and mountains but as a nation of deep culture, faith, and renewal.

Every day lost to inaction is an opportunity missed — for airlines, for tourism, and for the people who have worked tirelessly to make Jaffna shine again. The infrastructure is ready, the demand is undeniable, and the world is watching.

Give Jaffna its wings — and it will carry Sri Lanka to the top of the world’s travel map.

One of the strongest contributors to Jaffna’s rise on Lonely Planet’s global list is the surge in Indian tourist arrivals. India now remains Sri Lanka’s largest inbound market, accounting for nearly 20–25 percent of total international visitors. Many of these travellers arrive directly to the Jaffna International Airport on short-haul flights from South India, particularly from Chennai and Tiruchirappalli, which have resumed since the airport’s reopening.

Complementing these air connections are the Nagapattinam–Kankesanthurai ferry services, now operating under the India–Sri Lanka maritime connectivity initiative. These ferries carry both tourists and traders, encouraging cross-border cultural exchanges and short leisure visits to Jaffna and the Northern islands.

Together, these air and sea links have positioned Jaffna as the gateway for Indian travellers — a fact that significantly contributed to Lonely Planet’s decision to rank it the world’s second-best destination for 2026. With continued expansion of flight frequencies and ferry operations, Jaffna could easily claim the top spot next year.
