Siyapatha Finance initiates financial literacy programmes covering all provinces

In celebration of a 20-year-long journey of changing lives through comprehensive financial solutions and awareness, Siyapatha Finance PLC successfully concluded its nationwide financial literacy programme with a goal of connecting with and promoting responsible financial behavior among existing as well as prospective customers.

Witnessing the participation of enthusiastic, aspiring invitees in 13 regions across the Island Nation, from entrepreneurs, small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs), and influential community members to local authority figures and interested parties, these interactive programmes tapped into an array of topics that set an essential basis for managing lifelong financial aspects in life.

The initiative, comprising 13 structured financial literacy programmes, was meticulously organized by Siyapatha Finance Senior Regional Managers and Regional Managers with the support of branch officers to address current challenges and trends.

Aligned with the Financial Consumer Protection Regulations (Gazette No. 2344) of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the initiative is a reflection of Siyapatha Finance’s vision to support and sustain financial inclusion, women empowerment, poverty alleviation, and the transition of the non-banking segment to the formal financial system.

Each programme commenced by touching upon the fundamentals of financial literacy, explaining the importance of personal money management and informed financial decision-making as well as different investment tools such as leasing, gold loans, factoring, and green finance available in the market.

Participants were further enlightened on concepts such as “Samajeevikathawa” – the concept of “living within means”, ethical financial behaviour, and its broader community impact – and anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism as a measure to raise awareness on the realities of selecting licensed, reputable, and secure financial institutions in reaching their aspirations.
