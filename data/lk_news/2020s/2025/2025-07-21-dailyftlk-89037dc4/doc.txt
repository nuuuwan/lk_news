SJB rejects leadership rumours amid alleged political sabotage

The main opposition party, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Mujibur Rahman yesterday firmly denied speculation of an internal move to oust Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, while alleging a broader conspiracy aimed at undermining both the party and its Leader.

“There has been no discussion within the SJB to remove Sajith Premadasa from his position as Opposition Leader,” he said at a media briefing.

However, he claimed that there are certain groups working to politically destroy both the party and its Leader.

He alleged that these factions appear to be operating with the tacit support of the Government.

Rahman also signalled openness to potential new alliances, noting that bringing in experienced politicians such as Dayasiri Jayasekara would be a positive move.

“Dayasiri is a capable and seasoned politician. Welcoming people like him into the SJB will strengthen the party,” he added.
