Online facility for land maps available from today: Survey Department

The Survey Department yesterday announced that land maps will be available online from today (1), marking a major step towards digital public services.

Surveyor General Y.G. Gnanathilaka made this announcement during a media briefing yesterday, held coinciding with the Department’s 225th anniversary celebrations which falls today, and the Department also plans to issue a commemorative stamp to mark the occasion.

“Till Thursday (31 July), the public could obtain survey maps only through Departmental offices. With the new system, individuals can now purchase maps via online payment through the Department’s website,” he said.

Gnanathilaka also said that the land information database of the Survey Department is linked with the Land Registry Department, enabling the public to access land-related data.

According to the Surveyor General, all maps and plans have now been digitised, and nearly 2.4 million land plots have been archived in the Department’s data repository.

Additionally, land survey-related information has been integrated into the Department’s system, and when issuing land title certificates, digitised survey sketches can be accessed via the Department’s website.
