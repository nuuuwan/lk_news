Sri Lanka made its presence felt at the Forbes Under 30 Summit Asia 2025, as four remarkable alumni from the island nation participated in the three-day event held in Thailand. Among them were Sozo Beverages Founders Dushyantha and Gianee De Silva, Silver Aisle Founder Yanika Amarasekera-Siyaguna, Synapse AI Labs Founder Nikin Matharaarachchi, and Actor/Filmmaker Dinara Punchihewa.

The annual summit, now in its sixth edition, brought together hundreds of honorees from the Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia lists (2016–2025) under the theme ‘Jumpstarting The Future’. With panel discussions, cultural showcases, networking opportunities, and performances, the event celebrated innovation and leadership across Asia’s rapidly transforming business and creative landscapes.

Each of them represented distinct industries, yet were united by a shared ethos – to build businesses that are both disruptive and socially conscious.
