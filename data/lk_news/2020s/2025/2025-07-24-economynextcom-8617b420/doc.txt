Sri Lanka can come up with new instruments, no need to sell CB-held bonds now: Governor

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank saw no need to sell down its bond portfolio at the moment and if required new instruments could be used for monetary policy, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.

Governor Weerasinghe had previously said it will “explore ways to gradually phase out its holding of restructured bonds, a legacy of the Central Bank’s financial support to the Government during the crisis.”

“I don’t think there’s a need now,” Governor Weerasinghe said.

“This is all for open market operations. If we have an instrument, we can use it. If not, we have to come up with an instrument for open market operations.”

At one time the central bank used its own central bank securities to mop up liquidity and build reserves but they were abandoned.

Around 2014 after running out Treasury bills, the central bank used dollar rupee swap and also borrowed securities from the Employees Provident Fund to sell and mop up liquidity.

Sell downs of central bank securities reduces liquidity in banks and leads to reduced domestic credit and balance of payments surpluses.

At the moment the central bank gets coupons on its 2,500 billion rupee restructured bond portfolio which is deflationary. (Colombo/July24/2025)
