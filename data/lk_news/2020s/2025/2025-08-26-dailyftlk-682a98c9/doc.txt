“Premakeerthi Ghathanaye Sulamula” book launch tomorrow

Senior journalist Dharman Wickramaratne’s latest book “Premakeerthi Ghathanaye Sulamula”, written about the JVP’s second insurrection, will be launched tomorrow at 3 p.m. at the National Library and Documentation Services Board Auditorium, Colombo 7.

This book is based on the assassination of veteran radio broadcaster Premakeerthi de Alwis on 31 July, 1989 – 36 years ago, and the series of true events connected to it, compiled through in-depth research. This 256-page book contains 168 photographs.

During this said period, around 60,000 people were killed, including 17 artists with Premakeerthi amongst them. This latest release is the fourth book of Dharman Wickramaratne’s series on the JVP’s second insurrection, and it is also his 55th publication.

Dharman previously published three other books about the span of time between 1986 and 1990: “Ginnen Upan Gini Pupuru” (Flames Born of Fire), “Satanin Satana” (Battle after Battle), and “Comrade Lionel”, which were highly regarded by critics and readers alike.

The book launch ceremony will be chaired by Attorney-at-Law Jaliya Samarasinghe, while key-note speakers will be veteran poet and lyricist Buddhadasa Galappatty, veteran music critic Dhammika Bandara, and Prof. Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa. The launch is open to the public, and further details can be obtained by calling 071-2733986.
