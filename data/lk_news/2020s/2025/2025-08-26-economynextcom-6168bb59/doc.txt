Sri Lanka former President Wickremesinghe granted bail by court

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s former President Ranil Wickremesinghe has been granted bail on medical grounds by the Colombo Fort Magistrate.

The Attorney General’s department had objected to bail, lawyers told crowds gathered outside the courthouse during the hearing.

Wickremesinghe, who is in hospital, was not present in court on doctors’ recommendations.

He was remanded until Tuesday, August 26 by the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court on Friday, after being arrested by the police criminal investigation department when he came in to give a statement.

He was arrested over an alleged mis-use of state-funds for a stop-over in London to visit a university where his wife was made an honorary professor, when he was returning from the US after addressing a UN General Assembly meeting. (Colombo/Aug26/2025)
