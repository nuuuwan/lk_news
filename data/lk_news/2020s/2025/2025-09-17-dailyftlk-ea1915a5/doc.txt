Govt. launches digital signatures for public officials

Public Administration, Provincial Councils, and Local Government Minister Chandana Abeyratne

The Public Administration Ministry has rolled out digital signatures for Government officers as part of efforts to modernise State services and improve efficiency in official transactions.

Public Administration, Provincial Councils, and Local Government Minister Chandana Abeyratne introduced the initiative at a ceremony marking the adoption of digital signatures within the Home Affairs Division.

Highlighting the wider aim of the Government, the Minister said the shift to digital tools is intended to reshape the public sector to meet the expectations of citizens. “We must deliver an efficient public service that people can rely on. This initiative should extend down to Grama Niladhari level,” he noted.

The move is being implemented under the Electronic Transactions Act No. 19 of 2006, starting with District and Divisional Secretariat officials attached to the Home Affairs Division. LankaPay, designated under the Act, is issuing the digital signatures.

According to officials, the system is expected to reduce processing delays and create a faster, safer, and more transparent workflow in Government administration.
