Unawatuna’s Sky Breeze Café wins global award

Sky Breeze, a beachside café in Unawatuna, has been honoured with the title “Best All-Day Scenic Dining Café Experience” at the Global Business Excellence Awards 2025.

The London Business Consultancy, which organised the ceremony held in Colombo, presented the award, recognising the café’s unique semi fine dining experience.
