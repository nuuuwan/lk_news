Macktiles Lanka makes history in ‘porcelain perfection’ with 100pct Sri Lankan minerals

In a singular moment that rewrites the narrative of global manufacturing excellence, Macktiles Lanka (Private) Limited has achieved what was once considered impossible: creating authentic real porcelain tiles using exclusively Sri Lankan minerals. The island’s extraordinary geological wealth has now proven its potential extends far beyond traditional applications, with Macktiles unlocking the manufacturing capabilities of these mineral-rich deposits to create porcelain that doesn’t just meet international standards but obliterates them.

Real porcelain tiles require water absorption rates of less than 0.5%. While this has always been achieved using imported minerals from overseas, Macktiles has achieved an exceptional 0.2% absorption rate using 100% Sri Lankan minerals – a technical tour de force that positions Sri Lankan geological wealth as the new gold standard for luxury ceramics. This isn’t mere manufacturing; its geological alchemy transforming the island once known as “Ratna-Deepa” – the Gem Island – into a porcelain powerhouse.
