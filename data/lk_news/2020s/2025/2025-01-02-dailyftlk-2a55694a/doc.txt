Namal Kumara remanded until 15 Jan.

Self-proclaimed activist Namal Kumara has been remanded until 15 January by the Colombo Fort Magistrate. Kumara was taken into custody when he arrived at the Colombo Crime Division (CCD) to provide a statement yesterday.

The arrest follows a complaint lodged by Namal Kumara with the Presidential Secretariat and the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) regarding an audio recording that allegedly tarnished the reputation of the Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith.

The Catholic Church has since urged authorities to investigate the matter thoroughly. The Colombo Archdiocese, through its Media Director Rev. Fr. Jude Krishantha, has expressed concerns about Kumaraâ€™s alleged involvement in controversial activities. Rev. Fr. Krishantha said that Kumara was reportedly a supporter of the 2019 Easter Sunday attack and was allegedly orchestrating another drama under the influence of a third party.

In a letter to Acting Inspector General of Police Priyantha Weerasooriya, the Catholic Church had earlier requested justice and a transparent investigation into the complaint filed by Namal Kumara.

Former MP and actor Ranjan Ramanayake was also questioned by the CCD on Tuesday regarding this incident.
