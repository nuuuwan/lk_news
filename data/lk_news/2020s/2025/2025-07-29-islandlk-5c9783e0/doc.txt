Breaking free from conventional investment paths; How to make your money work harder

Picture this: You have some extra money sitting in your drawer, while across town, an established manufacturing company with a solid track record desperately needs funds to expand their operations and hire more workers. How do these two needs meet? Welcome to the fascinating world of capital markets – Sri Lanka’s financial matchmaking service.

Think of capital markets as giant marketplaces where money changes hands. Just like in an ordinary marketplace, companies come to capital markets to “buy” money (through borrowing or selling shares), while people with extra cash come to “sell” their money (by investing) in exchange for returns.

In simple terms, capital markets help channel money from people who have it (savers and investors) to people who need it (businesses and governments) to grow and create jobs.

It is the general consensus that the depositing your hard-earned money in a bank is the safest option, what’s with the collective financial trauma Sri Lankans have gone through via experiences like the Golden Key Scandal and the Sakvithi Debacle.

For years, the journey of your money looked like this: You earn money → deposit it in a bank → bank lends it to businesses → bank keeps most of the profit. In fact, according to the Economic Financial Review 2024, published by The Central Bank of Sri Lanka, showed that deposits, collectively racked up to an amount of Rupees 17,969.4 billion which accounted for 81% of the banking industry’s total liabilities and equity at the end of 2024. This reveals how there is a massive deposit concentration in the economy created by the overwhelming confidence in the banking sector. It is obvious that Sri Lankans understand the vitality of the banks and that they provide essential services, keep our money safe, and fund countless businesses. Essentially, they have become the backbone of Sri Lanka’s financial system.

However, this system has natural limitations. Banks must be careful with depositors’ money, so they’re selective about who gets loans. Interest rates stay high because banks need to cover their costs and risks. Many promising small businesses get turned away simply because they don’t fit standard lending criteria.

The Bottom Line is that Banks have served Sri Lanka well and continue to play a crucial role. But very little of your bank savings are used for the overall development of the country. So where do we go from here?

The Game Changer: Direct Connection to Funds via The Capital Market

Enter capital markets with a revolutionary idea: “Why not let savers and borrowers deal directly with each other?” Essentially cutting out of the middleman which simply means “removing the go-between.”

Moving away from the role of banks, capital markets offer something additional: the power for ordinary people to directly participate in building the economy while growing their own wealth. It’s not about choosing sides – it’s about having more financial freedom and opportunities.

Instead of your money sitting in a bank that decides who gets it, you can now directly choose to invest in companies you believe in. It’s like buying directly from the farmer instead of going through multiple middlemen.

When companies need money, they have two main paths in capital markets:

When it comes to the ownership in terms of Equity, the ownership dilutes with each share issue but in terms of debt . the holder retains the ownership. In equity shareholders receive a share of their profits and losses but in debt, the holder has no claim on profit and losses

Imagine you and your friends want to start a restaurant. Instead of borrowing money, you decide to sell small pieces of ownership to raise funds. This is exactly what happens in equity markets. Companies sell shares, which represent small pieces of ownership, to the public to raise capital. When you buy shares, you become a part-owner of the company, and if the company performs well, your shares become more valuable. Additionally, you might receive dividends, which are your share of the company’s profits distributed to shareholders.

Sometimes companies prefer to borrow money rather than give away ownership, which is where debt markets come in. In this scenario, companies issue IOUs called bonds or debentures to raise funds. When you buy these securities, you’re essentially lending money to the company, and they promise to pay you back with interest over a specified period. You receive regular interest payments throughout the loan term until they repay the full principal amount. Think of it like this: if equity is like having a business partner, debt is like being a money lender with a written promise of repayment.

Ownership – When it comes to equity financing, ownership is diluted as shares are sold to investors. However, in debt financing, the debt holder retains ownership.

Profit/Loss Sharing – In equity financing, shareholders receive a share of profits and losses, as opposed to debt financing in which lenders have no claim on profits or losses
