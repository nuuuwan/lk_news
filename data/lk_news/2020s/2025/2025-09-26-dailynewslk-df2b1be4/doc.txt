The stage is set for another classic battle in the pool when Royal College Colombo and S. Thomas’ College Mount Lavinia clash in the 32nd Dr. R. L. Hayman Trophy Water Polo Matches, with the first leg on Saturday, September 27, and the return leg on October 4 at the Sugathadasa Aquatic Sports Complex in Colombo.

The encounter, regarded as Sri Lanka’s premier schools’ water polo rivalry, will feature matches across three age groups – the Under-13 match from 1.00 p.m., the Under-15 clash from 3.00 p.m., and the Under-19 main event at 5.00 p.m. under lights.

Royal College will be led by  Anuga Handunpathirana, a versatile wing player known for his speed and accuracy. He will rely on support from teammates such as centre forwards Ramiru Aluthge and Indeev de Silva, goalkeeper Imaad Ismath, and a strong defensive unit marshalled by Talal Bary at centre back. The Reid Avenue side, defending champions, will aim to continue their momentum after recapturing the trophy last year with a 25-17 aggregate win, ending a two-year wait.

S.Thomas’ College, Mount Lavinia, will be captained by the talented Amitesha Sentitcumaran, backed by his vice-captain Shehran Nawaz. The Thomian squad is filled with depth and experience, including Kavin Nanayakkara, Arith Salgado and rising star goalkeeper Michael Gunawardana. With a blend of skill, stamina, and tactical awareness, the Thomians are determined to reverse last year’s result and bring the trophy back to Mount Lavinia.

The Hayman Trophy, first introduced in 1992, has become one of the most colourful fixtures in the schools’ sports calendar. Played over two legs, the aggregate score decides the winner, making every goal vital. Over the years, the series has produced some of the finest players to represent Sri Lanka in international water polo.

Last year Royal edged out their traditional rivals with a two-leg score of 13-9 in the first match and 12-8 in the second, sealing a convincing 25-17 victory. That success ended S. Thomas’ dominance and gave Royal the bragging rights in one of the most fiercely contested school sports rivalries in the country.

This year, the Thomians arrive with renewed energy, determined to regain lost pride. Their balanced squad, built on both power and precision, will test Royal’s defence to the limit. On the other hand Royal are focused on consistency and discipline, eager to extend their reign and prove that last year’s triumph was no accident.
