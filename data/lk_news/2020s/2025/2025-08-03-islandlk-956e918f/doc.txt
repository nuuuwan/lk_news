Japan to share its insights and support Sri Lankan businesses to building happier, more productive teams

In a landmark move to enhance employee wellbeing and corporate excellence, the Chamber of Young Lankan Entrepreneurs (COYLE) and the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) signed an MoU recently, paving the way for stronger Sri Lanka-Japan collaboration in fostering healthier, more productive workplaces.

This partnership is set to revolutionize Sri Lanka’s corporate sector by integrating Japan’s globally acclaimed Health and Productivity Management practices with local business strategies. The collaboration will focus on advancing workplace sustainability, employee wellness, and long-term business resilience which are key priorities for Sri Lanka’s evolving economy.

At the core of this alliance is the Sri Lanka Corporate Health & Productivity Awards (SLCHPA) an initiative by COYLE to recognize companies that champion employee wellbeing and sustainable business growth. With JETRO’s support, the awards will now serve as a national benchmark, encouraging Sri Lankan firms to adopt world-class workplace standards.

The MoU also establishes a framework for knowledge sharing, benchmarking, and capacity-building, leveraging Japan’s expertise in human resource management, workplace innovation, and employee-centric policies. This partnership will help Sri Lankan businesses to enhance productivity through healthier workplace practices, adopt global best practices while tailoring them to local needs, and strengthen bilateral ties with Japan in economic and social development.

Speaking at the signing ceremony, representatives from COYLE and JETRO highlighted the partnership’s potential to drive meaningful change in Sri Lanka’s corporate landscape.
