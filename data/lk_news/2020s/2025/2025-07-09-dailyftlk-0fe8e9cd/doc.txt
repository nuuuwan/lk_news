Three-member committee to probe irregularities in Central Cultural Fund

The Government has launched a formal inquiry into reported irregularities in the provision of financial assistance by the Central Cultural Fund (CCF) to religious institutions during the period 2017 to 2020.

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved establishing a three-member investigative committee, chaired by retired Supreme Court Judge G.M.W. Pradeep Jayathilaka.

Following growing concerns over the misuse of public funds allocated for religious and cultural preservation, the 223rd Governing Council meeting of the Central Cultural Fund, held on 17 May 2025, resolved to appoint an independent committee to examine the alleged discrepancies.

“The committee’s mandate is to conduct a thorough review of financial allocations made to religious places during the stated period, identify irregularities, and recommend corrective action if necessary,” Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.  The proposal to this effect was submitted by Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
