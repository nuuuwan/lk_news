Govt. speeding development of hydrogen as renewable energy source

Sri Lanka is gearing up to embrace hydrogen as a renewable energy source, with the government pledging to provide all possible support for its development, Power and Energy Minister Eng. Kumara Jayakody announced recently.

Addressing the Stakeholder Consultation on the Draft Renewable Hydrogen Policy of Sri Lanka in Colombo, Minister Jayakody said hydrogen energy will be central to the country’s long-term power strategy. He underscored that the government’s commitment lies not only in adopting new technologies but also in ensuring that renewable energy resources are harnessed to their maximum potential.

“Our government’s policy direction is to fully utilize renewable energy and advanced technology to achieve our energy goals. Hydrogen will be of immense importance for electricity generation in the future. Preparing a national policy is the first crucial step, and today’s stakeholder consultation is a key milestone,” Jayakody said.

Sri Lanka’s renewable energy potential is considered high, particularly in solar and wind, yet challenges in transmission, storage, and infrastructure have hindered large-scale integration into the national grid. Jayakody acknowledged these obstacles, stressing that the government is prioritizing investments to modernize the power sector.

“We are working with dedication to improve transmission and storage capacity as well as strengthen the necessary infrastructure so that renewable energy can flow seamlessly into the electricity system,” he said.

The consultation, organized by the Ministry of Power and Energy together with the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority, drew participation from top policymakers, academics, energy experts, and international partners.

Minister Jayakody noted that building a robust hydrogen policy requires both local input and international expertise. “This is not a journey we can take alone. It is important to gain insights from developed nations that have already made significant progress in this field. Equally, it is vital to engage Sri Lankan scientists and professionals abroad who have long been working in renewable energy and hydrogen technology,” he said.

“Securing the support of global experts and our own diaspora scientists is a significant achievement. I also wish to extend my gratitude to the institutions and specialists who are contributing in various ways to this national effort,” the Minister added.

The event brought together senior government officials including Ministry Secretary Prof. Udayanga Hemapala, Transport and Highways Secretary Prof. Kapila C.K. Perera, and Environment Secretary K.R. Uduwawala. International partners were also represented, with UNDP Deputy Resident Representative Marina Ten underscoring the organization’s support for Sri Lanka’s clean energy transition.

Heads of key energy institutions such as the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, the Sri Lanka Atomic Energy Board, and the Lanka Electricity Company were also present, signaling the cross-sectoral importance of hydrogen development.

Globally, hydrogen is gaining recognition as a critical component of decarbonization strategies. Countries such as Japan, Germany, and Australia have invested heavily in hydrogen technologies, positioning themselves as leaders in the energy transition. For Sri Lanka, adopting hydrogen is seen not only as a step towards energy security but also as an opportunity to align with global markets and attract green investment.
