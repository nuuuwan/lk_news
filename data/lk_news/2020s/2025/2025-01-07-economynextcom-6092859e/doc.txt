Sri Lanka Cabinet grants incentives to airlines for tourism boost

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Cabinet of Ministers has granted tax concession for airlines which will operate flights to the island nation’s international airports with more capacity aiming to boost tourist arrivals.

The move comes as Sri Lanka’s main Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) is facing difficulties in accommodating all the arrivals.

The tax concessions have been introduced by the Airport and Aviation Services (Sri

Lanka) (Private) Limited with the objective of attracting international airline services for the Jaffna International Airport, Colombo International Airport (Rathmalana), and Mattala Rajapaksha

However, those incentives came to an end and had to be extended.

The Cabinet approved to further extend the tax relief to the three airports.

The Cabinet granted “extension of concession of 50% fee waiver from the presently implemented deviation tax

for the airlines operating fixed-time flights to Jaffna International Airport till January 30, 2026 while the same was extended for the airlines operating fixed-time flights to Colombo International Airport (Rathmalana) for the period of one year from, March 27, 2025.

For the airlines operating fixed-time flights to Mattala Rajapaksha International Airport  the extension of the full concession was granted for a further one-year period from December 29, 2024. (Colombo/January 07/2025)
