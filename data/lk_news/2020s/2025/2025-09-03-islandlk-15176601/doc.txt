HNB General Insurance Certified™ as a Great Place To Work® in Sri Lanka

HNB General Insurance (HNBGI), one of Sri Lanka’s most dynamic and customer-focused general insurers, has been officially Great Place To Work® Certified™. This recognition is based entirely on employee’s anonymous feedback and marks a significant milestone in the company’s journey of building a workplace culture rooted in trust, belonging, and shared purpose.

According to Great Place To Work®, “A great workplace is one in which employees – no matter who they are or what they do – experience a consistently positive environment characterized by trust in leadership, pride in their work, and meaningful relationships with colleagues.”

A large majority of HNBGI employees affirmed these values, highlighting the company’s strong emphasis on inclusion, collaboration, career growth, and well-being. Employees described HNBGI as a place where people are not just valued but celebrated – both professionally and personally.

Sithumina Jayasundara, Director/CEO of HNB General Insurance, shared his thoughts on the certification, “This recognition is deeply meaningful to us because it comes directly from our people. At HNBGI, we have always believed that culture is not just about performance – it’s about purpose. From industry awards to sporting championships, from community outreach to innovation, we’ve created a workplace where everyone contributes, belongs, and thrives. I thank our team for building this culture with us, every single day.”
