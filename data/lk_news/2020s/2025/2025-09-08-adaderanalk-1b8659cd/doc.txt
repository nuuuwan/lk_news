“Harak Kata” to remain in custody under PTA until trial ends – AG Informs court

Nadun Chinthaka Wickramaratne, also known as “Harak Kata”, a prominent underworld figure allegedly linked to large-scale drug trafficking, is to remain in custody under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) until the conclusion of legal proceedings, as per a detention order issued by the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, the Attorney General informed the Colombo High Court today (08).

This submission was presented by Senior State Counsel Sajith Bandara, appearing on behalf of the Attorney General, during today’s hearing before High Court Judge Sujeewa Nissanka, Ada Derana reporter said.

During a previous hearing, the State Counsel informed court that after the expiry of the initial detention order, the suspect would be produced in remand custody. However, due to security concerns, the Secretary of the Ministry of Defence has decided to extend his detention under the PTA.

President’s Counsel Jaliya Samarasinghe, appearing for the suspect, strongly objected to the decision, pointing out that his client has already been held in detention for nearly two years. He argued that instead of continuing under PTA detention, the suspect should be placed in judicial remand custody.

Despite the objections, court was informed that “Harak Kata” will continue to be held under the custody of the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) at the Old Tangalle Prison, in line with the Defence Secretary’s order.

“Harak Kata” was presented before court via Zoom, and the case has been postponed to September 24, for further proceedings.

In addition to “Harak Kata”, four other suspects named in the same case were physically produced in court today.

Prison authorities were instructed to present all suspects again on the next hearing date.
