Rate cut likely in upcoming monetary policy review: First Capital Research

First Capital Research, in its Pre-Policy Analysis Report – July 2025, anticipates that the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) will prioritize economic growth in its upcoming monetary policy meeting, with a potential rate cut on the horizon.

According to the report, there is a 60% probability of a rate reduction, with a 50% chance of a 25 basis points (bps) cut and a 10% likelihood of a deeper 50 bps reduction, aimed at stimulating economic activity.

However, the analysis also notes a 40% probability that CBSL may hold rates steady to assess evolving domestic and global economic conditions.

Additionally, the report suggests an 80% probability that the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) will remain unchanged. However, given improved liquidity in the financial system, there is a 20% chance of a 100 bps SRR hike.

First Capital Research’s assessment highlights the delicate balance between supporting growth and maintaining stability as Sri Lanka navigates its economic recovery.
