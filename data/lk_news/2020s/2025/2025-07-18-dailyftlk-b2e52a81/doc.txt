Cabinet approves new sewage treatment plants

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved constructing mechanical sewage refinery centres in selected Local Governments using Rs. 200 million from the provisions allocated for the ‘Clean Sri Lanka’ program.

The move aims to address existing obstacles in sewage and soakage management due to a lack of sufficient refinery centres.

Announcing the decision at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing on Tuesday, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said accomplishing the soakage and sewage management service network has faced obstacles due to a lack of sufficient sewage refinery centres. Therefore, at times, sewage collected at some occasions has to be disposed of to the open environment.

Against this backdrop, he said the requirement to develop infrastructure facilities for managing soakage and sewage has been recognised as per the national policy on waste disposal.

The proposal to this effect, submitted by Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Government Dr. A.H.M.H. Abayarathna, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
