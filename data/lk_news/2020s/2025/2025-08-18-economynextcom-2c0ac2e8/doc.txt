US launches Young South Asian Leaders Initiative workshop in Sri Lanka

ECONOMYNEXT – A US-funded Young South Asian Leaders Initiative (YSALI) workshop was launched in Sri Lanka’s Colombo aimed at providing youth ‘networks needed to build positive regional connections’.

The three-day workshop brings together over 80 youth leaders, selected from alumni of previous US government initiatives, from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka to address shared challenges and opportunities, including economic development, civic participation, and regional collaboration.

Through the program the United States is building lasting networks and cultivating future partners and advocates for American businesses and shared interests, the US Embassy said.

“Each of you has already demonstrated leadership through your participation in US government exchange programs, taking the initiative to create change—often in challenging circumstances,” US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung said.

“Now, by coming together, you are combining your ideas, talents, and dreams to shape the future of this region.

“When you succeed, the Indo-Pacific region becomes stronger, more connected, and more prosperous for all.”

At the workshop, participants will engage with experts, business representatives, and government officials in interactive sessions designed to share US expertise in entrepreneurship and leadership.

Participants will take part in the YSALI Expo, which will bring together local organizations, US partners, and program alumni to showcase US businesses, civic initiatives, and entrepreneurial projects. (Colombo/Aug18/2025)
