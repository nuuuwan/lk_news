ECONOMYNEXT – A team of 18 Sri Lankan business leaders are set to visit Japan later this month, the Sri Lanka–Japan Business Council (SLJBC) of The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce said.

The delegation is led by Krishan Balendra, chairperson of the chamber and John Keells Holdings, and the visit will coincide with the President Anura Dissanayake’s visit to Japan.

A key feature of the visit will be the Business Forum in Tokyo, organised in partnership with the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (JCCI), the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO), the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).

The visit is aimed at facilitating new trade, investment, and collaboration opportunities between the two countries, the chamber said.

“The delegation will participate in targeted B2B sessions in Osaka, organized by the Export Development Board, enabling Sri Lankan companies to connect directly with potential Japanese partners.”

The team will also participate in “Sri Lanka Day” at Expo 2025 Osaka.

The SLJBC said the visit will play a role in deepening bilateral relations and unlocking new opportunities for investment and cooperation. (Colombo/Sep27/2025)
