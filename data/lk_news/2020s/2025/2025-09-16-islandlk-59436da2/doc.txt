Pan Asia Bank and NCE forge strategic alliance to power Sri Lanka’s export growth

Pan Asia Bank, one of Sri Lanka’s fastest-growing commercial banks, has entered into a strategic partnership with the National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) to empower and support the country’s export community.

Exports remain a lifeline for Sri Lanka’s economy, generating vital foreign exchange, driving industrial innovation, and creating jobs across multiple sectors. In the current context of economic recovery, strengthening the export sector is critical for stabilizing the nation’s external balances and securing long-term sustainable growth. Recognizing this, Pan Asia Bank’s collaboration with NCE is designed to provide exporters with both the financial tools and strategic guidance needed to expand their global reach.

Through this alliance, Pan Asia Bank will deliver customized financial solutions, trade services, and international banking facilities to exporters, helping them navigate the complexities of global markets. NCE members will benefit from priority access to trade finance, foreign exchange services, and advisory support tailored to the needs of businesses seeking to enhance their competitiveness abroad.

“Exports are the backbone of Sri Lanka’s economy, and at Pan Asia Bank, we are committed to fostering their growth. Through this partnership, we will extend specialized financial solutions, trade services, and global connectivity to exporters, ensuring they remain competitive in international markets.”

This collaboration reinforces Pan Asia Bank’s commitment to empowering Sri Lanka’s businesses and aligns with NCE’s mission to elevate the export sector as a key driver of national economic growth.
