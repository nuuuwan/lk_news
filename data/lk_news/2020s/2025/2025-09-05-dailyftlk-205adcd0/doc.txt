NCE delegation  to South strengthens regional export linkages

The National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE), in collaboration with the Southern Agriculture Entrepreneurs Development Centre, successfully organised a special delegation to the Southern Province to strengthen partnerships between exporters and regional producers.

The event attracted over 75 suppliers, producers, and aspiring exporters from the region. They were joined by 25 NCE member companies, who engaged directly with them to explore opportunities for sourcing, partnerships, and long-term collaborations.

The purpose of these regional programs is to directly engage with producers, identify gaps in their processes, and work towards upskilling and upgrading them to meet international standards. To this end, delegates from leading certifying bodies — who are also NCE members — took part in the delegation. They expressed strong interest in supporting regional producers to obtain globally recognised certifications, thereby improving their competitiveness in international markets.

Adding further value, NCE partner banks also participated in the visit. Their objective was to support SMEs by offering financial solutions, including loans, to help them meet certification and process improvement requirements.

A key factor in the success of the program is the involvement of established member exporters, who provide practical advice to producers on quality standards, buyer requirements, and global market expectations. These efforts are complemented by the support of Government agencies such as the Ministry of Agriculture, the National Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA), and the Industrial Development Board (IDB), which provide specialised training and financial assistance to help producers upgrade and develop export-ready products.

While the initiative is ongoing, the overarching goal is to create a platform where all stakeholders — exporters, certifying bodies, financial institutions, and Government agencies — can work together to uplift suppliers to international standards. By strengthening these grassroots-level linkages, the NCE aims to create a more inclusive, competitive, and sustainable export ecosystem for Sri Lanka.

The Chamber also announced plans to replicate similar initiatives in other regions, including the Northern and Wayamba Provinces, thereby expanding opportunities for rural producers and SMEs to access international markets.
