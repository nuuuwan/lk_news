Sri Lanka face India in final Super Four clash

Sri Lanka take on India today (26), in their final Asia Cup Super-Four fixture in Dubai, despite being already knocked out of the tournament. While the result won’t affect the standings, the match offers Sri Lanka a valuable opportunity to test themselves against a high-flying Indian side and reflect on their shortcomings ahead of the T20 World Cup 2026, which they will co-host with India early next year.

Sri Lanka entered the Super Four unbeaten in the group stage but, suffered back-to-back defeats against Bangladesh and Pakistan, which ended their hopes of reaching the final. The losses exposed several vulnerabilities in their T20 setup, particularly in team balance and tactical execution.

Skipper Charith Asalanka acknowledged the setbacks, calling them a ‘blessing in disguise’ and stressing the importance of using this phase to regroup.

Sri Lanka’s experimentation with team combinations did not yield results in their favour so far. Their initial strategy of fielding seven batters and four bowlers backfired, prompting a shift to five bowlers and six batters in the next game. However, Chamika Karunaratne, brought in as the fifth bowler, bowled just one over — highlighting the disconnect between planning and execution.

Janith Liyanage, in fine form, remains on the bench despite Sri Lanka’s fragile middle order. In the bowling department, Binura Fernando is the only squad member yet to feature in the tournament. Sri Lanka may need to look beyond their current Asia Cup squad to address deeper structural issues.

Domestic performers like Vishen Halambage, and bowlers such as Eashan Malinga, Asitha Fernando, Dilshan Madushanka, and Dushan Hemantha could offer fresh options, especially in spin. But any changes will depend on Sri Lanka’s long-term planning, which has so far struggled to deliver results.

Another tactical challenge lies in utilising part-time bowlers to complete the quota if Sri Lanka opts for just four frontline bowlers. Asalanka, Dasun Shanaka and Kamindu Mendis offer options, but selecting the right bowler at the right time has proven difficult for the captain.

Stopping Abhishek Sharma will be key for Sri Lanka, especially during the powerplay. Sharma’s aggressive style can quickly tilt the game in India’s favour. Additionally, Sri Lanka must navigate the middle overs carefully — between the 6th and 15th — where India has consistently applied pressure, particularly through spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy, who have been in top form throughout the tournament.
