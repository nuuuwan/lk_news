Delta flight diverted after being hit by turbulence, 25 passengers hospitalized

A Delta Airlines flight made an emergency landing at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport on Wednesday after dozens of people were injured during “significant” turbulence.

Flight 56 bound for Amsterdam took off from Salt Lake City airport at 16:30 local time (23:30 BST), before being diverted to Minneapolis. It landed just over two hours into its nine-hour flight time, at around 19:45 local time.

Medical personnel met the Airbus A330-900 to “evaluate customers and crew” after it arrived in Minneapolis, with 25 passengers then transported to local hospitals for care.

In a statement, Delta said that it is “working with customers to support their immediate needs”.

In the US, there have been 207 severe injuries caused by turbulence - where an individual has been admitted to hospital for more than 48 hours - since 2009, according to official figures from the National Transportation Safety Board.

Estimates show that there are around 5,000 incidents of severe-or-greater turbulence every year, out of a total of more than 35 million flights that now take off globally.

Severe turbulence is defined as when the up and down movements of a plane going through disturbed air exert more than 1.5g-force on your body - enough to lift you out of your seat if you weren’t wearing a seatbelt.
