Tilvin dismisses rumours of PM’s removal

The main constituent party of the NPP Government Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) General Secretary Tilvin Silva yesterday squashed claims that Prime Minister  Dr. Harini Amarasuriya will be removed from her post.

Speaking at a public meeting, Silva said such speculation had been repeatedly circulated by the Opposition but had not materialised.

“Earlier they claimed Harini Amarasuriya would lose her ministerial portfolio. Now they are saying she will be removed as Prime Minister. These are nothing more than their dreams,” he said. Silva added that the Opposition had been making what he described as unfounded claims for a long period, none of which had come to pass.
