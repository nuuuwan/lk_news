The Asia International Digital Economy and AI in Finance Summit 2025, featuring the Asian Digital Finance Forum and Awards, has named FinTech Intel as its Strategic Global Media Partner. The summit will take place on 23 October 2025 at Port City Colombo.

FinTech Intel is a leading publishing and market intelligence platform for global fintech and financial services innovation. A forward-thinking provider of insights, news, and reports for the expansive and fast-growing fintech industry, it also organises the UK, Europe, US, Asia, and MENA FinTech Awards. FinTech Intel is owned by UK-based Barker Brooks Communications Ltd., a trusted media brand since 1998 with deep expertise in delivering high-quality live events and media content across the insurance, legal, financial, education, and medical sectors.

“We are delighted to welcome FinTech Intel as our Strategic Global Media Partner. Their global reach and editorial expertise will amplify the impact of this year’s summit and help highlight Asia’s growing role in shaping the future of digital finance and AI,” said Industry Fellow at the Global Fintech Institute, Singapore, and a judge at the Asia FinTech Awards Rajkumar Kanagasingam.

Organised by the Asian FinTech Academy (AFTA) in collaboration with the Fintech Association of Sri Lanka (FASL), and with Port City Colombo as a strategic partner, the Summit will convene policymakers, innovators, and industry leaders to advance inclusive, AI-driven financial systems.

The 2025 theme, “Bridging Intelligence, Inclusion and Innovation in Asia’s Financial Future,” underscores the event’s commitment to building resilient and trusted digital economies.

The Summit is also supported by a network of global strategic partners, including Tech London Advocates (TLA), Global Tech Advocates (GTA), the International Digital Economies Association (iDEA), and Wall Street Fintech AI Inc., reflecting its position within a wider international dialogue on digital finance and AI.

A key highlight of the program will be the Asian Digital Finance Forum and Awards 2025, where an independent international panel will recognise achievements in ethical AI, financial inclusion, sustainability, and cross-border collaboration.

The partnership announcement with FinTech Intel followed the Asia FinTech Awards held in August 2025 at Andaz Singapore, underscoring the growing links between regional and global fintech ecosystems.
