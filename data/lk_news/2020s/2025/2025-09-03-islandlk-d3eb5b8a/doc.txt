Saving Sri Lanka’s rubber: Why CLSD must be tackled by RRISL without delay

Sri Lanka’s rubber industry, once a proud pillar of the national economy, is today facing one of the gravest threats in its history. The culprit is Circular Leaf Spot Disease (CLSD), a fungal pathogen that eats away at the very foundation of rubber cultivation—the leaves. Without healthy leaves, the latex yield falls, plantations weaken, and livelihoods collapse. This is not just a biological problem; it is a national economic and social challenge.

Yet despite the seriousness of the disease, the approach to managing CLSD has often been fragmented, with research scattered and sometimes resting on the shoulders of individual scientists. While the dedication of pathologists is never in doubt, the truth is simple: no single pathologist can carry a pandemic-scale plant disease programme. What is required is the full institutional power of the Rubber Research Institute of Sri Lanka (RRISL), supported by the Ministry of Plantation Industries, the Rubber Development Department, and the Rubber Research Board.

Globally, the management of major plant diseases—whether in bananas, coffee, or rice—has always been led by national crop research institutes, not individual experts. This ensures continuity, accountability, and the ability to mobilise multidisciplinary teams. RRISL, as the national institute dedicated to rubber, has laboratories, field stations, and trained staff. It is the only body capable of running large-scale surveillance, field trials, and grower outreach programs.

If CLSD research continues to rest on isolated expertise, Sri Lanka risks duplication of work, loss of institutional memory, and weak international credibility. By contrast, if RRISL leads, it can establish diagnostic protocols, surveillance systems, and integrated disease management packages that are nationally recognized, reported to international bodies like the IPPC, and trusted by global trade partners.

The Role of Tissue Culture in the Next Green Revolution for Rubber

One of the most promising but underutilised technologies in Sri Lankan rubber is tissue culture. For years, RRISL has worked with conventional breeding of rubber clones, but breeding is slow. CLSD demands speed. By investing in tissue culture technology, RRISL can develop rubber clones resistant to CLSD, multiply them rapidly in vitro, and distribute them to smallholders and estates.

This is not science fiction. Other countries have already perfected tissue culture in commercial crops such as banana and oil palm. If RRISL masters this technology for rubber, Sri Lanka can become a pioneer in the region. Resistant, tissue-culture-derived clones would allow replanting programs to go ahead with confidence, reducing the need for expensive fungicides and securing the sustainability of rubber farming.

Most current responses to CLSD are reactive: spraying fungicides once symptoms appear, pruning affected trees, or replanting after heavy losses. But as any doctor would say, prevention is better than cure. The Ministry of Plantation Industries, the Rubber Development Department, and the Rubber Research Board must shift towards preventive management strategies.

*  Correct stand per hectare to ensure proper air circulation and reduce humidity that encourages fungal spread.

*  Training for proprietary planters, who own the majority of Sri Lanka’s rubber lands, on affordable, practical disease-prevention techniques.

*  Resistant planting material from tissue culture labs to reduce vulnerability in the first place.

If prevention is institutionalized, the cost of CLSD management will drop dramatically, and farmers’ incomes will stabilise.

Rubber is not just a tree; it is a commercial investment. Every plantation decision—from planting density to fertilizer use—must be viewed through the lens of financial returns. This is where investment appraisal tools such as Net Present Value (NPV) become critical.

For any investment to be worthwhile, the NPV must remain above 1.0. That means the value of future earnings outweighs the costs today. If disease pressure increases, costs rise, and yields fall, the NPV drops below 1. That signals to investors that rubber is no longer viable.

RRISL has a duty not only to research disease management but also to recalculate investment models using real-time input costs—from fertiliser to fungicides to labour. Only then can policymakers, investors, and smallholders make informed choices. Without these updated appraisals, Sri Lanka risks discouraging future investment in rubber altogether.

A final but equally important pillar of the way forward is digital information platforms. Former Secretaries such as Ravindra Hewavitharana and Janaka Dharmakirti rightly emphasised the need for real-time, digital data collection and sharing. Without accurate, up-to-date data on disease incidence, weather conditions, and input prices, decision-making is nothing more than guesswork. Globally, agriculture is moving towards data-driven governance. Sri Lanka must not lag behind.

Imagine a system where a proprietary planter in Kalutara can report a disease outbreak via a smartphone app, RRISL can verify it through satellite-linked labs, and the Ministry can respond with region-wide alerts—all in real time. Such a platform would transform plantation agriculture into a modern, globally competitive sector.

Sri Lanka’s rubber industry stands at a crossroads. CLSD is a threat that cannot be ignored, but it is also an opportunity to modernize the sector, strengthen RRISL, and adopt new technologies. The way forward is clear:

*  RRISL must immediately take full institutional ownership of CLSD research and management.

*  Tissue culture technology must be perfected to rapidly multiply resistant clones.

*  Preventive disease management protocols must be mainstreamed alongside reactive measures.

*  Investment appraisals must be updated using real-time input costs to maintain NPV > 1.

*  Digital data platforms must be rolled out nationally, building on earlier initiatives.

If these steps are taken, Sri Lanka can not only save its rubber industry from CLSD but also position itself as a global leader in smart plantation management. If they are not, the cost will be borne by thousands of small planters, workers, and the national economy itself.

The choice before policymakers is stark: act boldly now, or allow a silent killer of plantations to erode one of Sri Lanka’s most valuable crops. The time for decisive action is now.
