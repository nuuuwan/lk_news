Sri Lanka urges diplomacy as Thailand Cambodia clashes intensify

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has called for a diplomatic measures to end a border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia which has claimed the lives of over 30 person on both sides and had led to tens of thousands fleeing border areas.

The conflict has seen drones, artillery and also F-16 fighters deployed as fighting escalated.

Cambodia has claimed that cluster bombs were used by Thailand and a historic temple has been shelled. Cambodia has close relations with China.

Offers by Malaysia’s Mahathir Mohammed to mediate have been rejected.

“The Government of Sri Lanka is concerned over the recent incidents along the Cambodia–Thailand border, which has resulted in the loss of life, displacement of civilians and damage to culturally significant sites,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

“As a nation guided by the timeless teachings of the Lord Buddha—centered on non-violence compassion and peaceful coexistence—Sri Lanka urges both countries to engage in early  diplomatic dialogue aimed at resolving differences peacefully.”

The latest military action stems from an incident in May at the Prasat Ta Muen Thom, an ancient Hindu temple located in a disputed area.

Earlier this week a Thai soldier stepped on a landmine in the border region near Preah Vihear temple, which was awarded to Cambodia by a ruling of the International Court of Justice in 1962, but the area remains disputed.

Cambodia has said that Thai attacks damaged the Preah Vihear.

Thailand and Cambodia, like Sri Lanka has a legacy of Indianized civilizations.

Present day Cambodia and Southern Vietnam was home to a series of Indianized settlements loosely referred to as Funan (from Chinese texts).

Like Sri Lanka’s Prince Vijaya, there is a legend that a Brahmin merchant Kaundinya arrived and married a native Naga princess Soma, who initially fought them. (Colombo/July26/2025)
