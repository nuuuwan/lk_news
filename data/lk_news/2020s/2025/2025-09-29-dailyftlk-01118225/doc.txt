Digital education policy to go before Cabinet by March 2026

A framework for digitalising Sri Lanka’s education system will be submitted to the Cabinet by March 2026, the Digital Task Force on Education Reform said last week.

The update was presented at the Subcommittee on Education under the Ministerial Consultative Committee, chaired by Prime Minister and Education Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, on Tuesday.

Officials outlined six priority areas for digitalisation, including tackling teacher shortages, providing ICT equipment, ensuring continuity of schooling during disruptions, and integrating digital tools into learning.

They said all schools without internet access will be connected by 31 December. Schools currently lacking basic digital resources will be given at least one smart board and a computer or laptop. Data presented showed three schools remain without electricity, 546 without computers or tablets, and 2,088 without smart boards.

Prime Minister Dr. Amarasuriya called the reforms a critical investment in the country’s future and urged stakeholders to contribute ideas to the Task Force. Education and Higher Education Deputy Minister Dr. Madhura Senevirathna, Ministry officials, and MPs also attended the meeting.
