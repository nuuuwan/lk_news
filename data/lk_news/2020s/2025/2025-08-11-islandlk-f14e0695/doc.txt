Do they kill elephants using the App? Why that question misses the point entirely

“Do they use the app to kill elephants?” It’s a question that’s been floating around social media and public discourse lately. But for those involved in the field—people who’ve spent years working to mitigate human-elephant conflict—the question seems not only absurd but dangerously misinformed.

“It’s hard not to laugh,” says Vinura Abeyrathne,the youngster who cereated the Elephant App, with the support of team members who helped craft Sri Lanka’s National Policy for Minimising Human-Elephant Conflict (2020). “Because if that was really the case, what were people using during the past 70 years when elephants were shot? They didn’t have an app then, did they?”

Vinura, along with Wildlife Ranger Saman Hallholuwa, is part of a team behind the Elephant Journey mobile app, a community-based conservation tool aimed at increasing public awareness and real-time reporting of elephant movements to reduce conflict and improve safety for both humans and elephants.

The app’s core philosophy is built around a powerful truth: “Awareness is conservation.”

“This isn’t just about knowing an elephant is nearby,” Vinura explains. “It’s about helping people respond smarter, safer. If a farmer knows a wild elephant is near his field, he can take steps to protect himself and avoid confrontation.”

But like any new technology, especially in rural settings, skepticism and resistance are expected. “When online learning came along, people doubted that too. But now it’s a part of everyday life,” he adds.

Vinura has combed through years of data on elephant deaths in Sri Lanka. What he found was revealing:

“Nearly 99% of elephant deaths are due to direct shootings—typically in sudden confrontations with people who have firearms, not from poachers or outsiders coming in to kill elephants for ivory or meat,” he says.

Most deaths happen when a farmer or villager, often caught off guard, shoots the elephant in self-defence—usually aiming for the head. “These aren’t targeted killings. They’re chaotic, tragic incidents in tense moments.”

He also points out that ivory poaching is incredibly rare in Sri Lanka. “We haven’t heard of a single confirmed case recently where a tusker was killed for ivory. If anyone has a legally proven case, they’re welcome to share it.”

The Elephant Journey app is not a tracking device for hunters; it’s a location-based reporting system.

If an elephant is spotted near a village, a user can submit a report.

Only users within a 5-kilometre radius of that area can see the alert.

Users do not receive constant notifications unless the report is relevant to their location.

“You can’t just sit in Colombo and see where elephants are in Monaragala,” Vinura clarifies. “The app is designed to prevent panic and avoid misuse.”

Some worry that the app will attract onlookers hoping to “see” elephants. Vinura dismisses this:

“People in these rural areas see elephants all the time. They’re not going to flock around a spot just because someone submitted a report. These aren’t safari tourists. These are villagers trying whose lives are in danger just outside their front doors.”

Even if someone does show up out of curiosity, he says, it can also trigger empathy. “You see a baby elephant, a mother, you start to think: why are they here? What are they going through? That’s where awareness begins.”

And what about the argument that someone could use the app to find and shoot an elephant?

“It makes no sense,” argues Vinura. “To shoot an elephant, you don’t wait for an app report. These aren’t stealth operations, most shootings happen in someone’s backyard, not hidden in a jungle.”

In fact, Sri Lanka doesn’t even have the kind of deep wilderness where poachers can hide for days. “There are no secret elephant-hunting gangs tracking elephants via apps,” adds Ranger Saman Hallholuwa. “It’s the local guy with a gun, scared for his life, making a tragic decision.”

The real genius of the Elephant Journey app is its simplicity. It empowers local communities to report, avoid, and understand elephants instead of reacting with fear or violence.

“We didn’t create this tool for academics or NGOs,” says Vinura. “We made it for farmers, children, mothers or anyone living with the threat of elephants outside their door.”

In his words, the question “Do they kill elephants using the app?” is as illogical as asking, “Do people cause accidents because of Google Maps?”

Elephant conservation is no longer just about protecting animals in distant forests. It’s about coexistence in real time in backyards, on roads, and in farmlands.

“This app doesn’t kill elephants,” says Vinura. “It might be one of the few things that can help keep them alive.”

Because in the end, saving elephants starts with understanding them—and understanding begins with awareness.

The Elephant Journey App is available for download on Android and iOS.

Developed by conservation professionals and wildlife experts to support real-time, community-based human-elephant coexistence.
