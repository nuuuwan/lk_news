Sri Lanka yet to finalize US tariff deal: President

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has yet to finalize the tariff deal with the United States and the government is making all the efforts to reduce the 20 percent tariff declared by the Donald Trump Administration, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake told the parliament.

“We are still in the process of finalizing the U.S. tariff deal. We are trying to reduce it further from the current 20 percent,” President Dissanayake said when he addressed the parliament on the U.S tariff deal.

Sri Lanka has been able to reduce the tariff from 44 percent announced by President Donald Trump on April 2. Later it was reduced to 30 percent before it was slashed to 20 percent last week. (Colombo/August 7/2025)
