Sri Lanka stocks close up 0.23-pct, S&P SL20 dips

ECONOMYNEXT – The Colombo Stock Exchange’s All Share Price Index (ASPI) closed 0.23 percent higher following a highly volatile session, brokers said.

“There was volatility in the market. Sizeable upward trend in the morning was seen. Slight profit taking was there but it didn’t last for too long,” Dimantha Mathew, Chief Research and Strategy Officer at First Capital Holdings PLC said.

The ASPI climbed 47.05 points on Thursday to close at 20,800.26; while the S&P SL20 index dipped 0.27 percent, or 16.67 points, to close at 6,045.77.

“Investors are moving into not so popular stocks. Not really from a particular sector as well,” Mathew said. “These were mostly low market cap stocks; slightly lower levels of liquidity.”

The ASPI was pushed higher on Dialog Axiata which ended 0.70 rupees up at 24.90; Ambeon Holdings which ended 14.25 rupees stronger at 132.75; Bukit Darah which ended 37.50 rupees up at 947.50; Carson Cumberbatch which moved 19.25 rupees down to 830.00; and LOLC Holdings closed up 6.50 rupees at 562.50.

Alliance Finance Company PLC said it will issue listed, rated, unsecured, subordinated high yield bonds, to raise 1.5 billion rupees.

Elsewhere, the Pakistan Stock Exchange’s KSE 100 Index was trading 0.09 percent weaker at 147,354.50.

Indian equity markets fell due to concern over the “impact of US tariffs on Indian goods, a day after punitive duties went into effect,” Reuters said.

India’s Nifty 50 fell 0.85 percent to 24,500.90, while the BSE Sensex was 0.87 percent up at 80,080.57.

Meanwhile, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index ended higher on artificial intelligence related stocks “as positive results from US chip giant Nvidia Corp. improved confidence in the sector,” Japan’s The Mainichi newspaper said.

The index moved 0.73 percent, or 308.52 points higher, to 42,828.79.
