Prime Minister calls for deep educational reform beyond textbooks

PRIME Minister and Education Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya on Saturday insisted that genuine educational reform in Sri Lanka must go beyond new textbooks, calling instead for a systemic transformation of the country’s outdated and exam-centric system.

Speaking at a panel discussion titled ‘For a Prosperous Nation – Let’s Unite as Women,’ organised by the Ratnapura District Women’s Collective of the National People’s Power (NPP), the Prime Minister underscored the deep-rooted challenges facing the education sector. The event, held at the Ratnapura Town Hall, brought together political leaders and grassroots activists to discuss the role of women in shaping national policy.

Highlighting the current pressure on students, parents, and teachers caused by Sri Lanka’s rigid examination structure, Dr. Amarasuriya said the proposed reforms would aim to ease this burden and address the broader societal consequences of the system’s competitiveness.

“These reforms are not about cosmetic changes. We are addressing the structural issues that place undue stress on children and their families,” she said, stressing that education should be about holistic development rather than rote learning for exams.

She also criticised the politicisation of education, pointing to so-called ‘National Schools’ in the Ratnapura district, where name boards were changed and buildings were inaugurated by politicians, yet no tangible improvements were made to learning outcomes.

“The education system was often used to advance narrow political agendas. This exhibitionist approach caused long-term damage, especially when successive Governments cut funding and placed more financial pressure on parents,” she added.

According to Dr. Amarasuriya, prior administrations repeatedly failed to allocate the necessary human capital, infrastructure, and resources for effective reforms, despite frequent rhetoric on the issue. In contrast, she said the current Government is committed to a structured and inclusive process, aiming to realign societal values and policy priorities around equitable and quality education.

“We’re initiating a public conversation. This is not just a policy shift—it’s a social transformation,” she noted, urging attendees to take the message forward and contribute to building an academically and economically competitive nation.

The event was attended by Ratnapura district NPP MP Nilusha Lakmali, Mayor Indrajith Katugampola, and several NPP Municipal and Local Council members, alongside a large number of party activists and community leaders.
