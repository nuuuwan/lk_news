Free Trade Zone Manufacturers Association hails UK boost for Lankan exports

The Free Trade Zone Manufacturers Association (FTZMA) has welcomed the United Kingdom’s decision to liberalise Rules of Origin and offer Zero Tariff access for Sri Lankan exports under the Developing Countries Trading Scheme (DCTS).

“This generous reform goes far beyond the apparel sector. Sri Lankan exporters now enjoy duty-free access to over 7,000 eligible product lines across a wide range of industries. In addition, the liberalisation of Rules of Origin provisions, particularly in apparel, allows manufacturers to source up to 100% of inputs from any country while maintaining tariff-free entry into the UK market,” said the FTZMA in a letter to UK High Commissioner Andrew Patrick.

“Such developments are poised to significantly enhance the competitiveness of Sri Lankan exports, safeguard livelihoods, and deepen the valued trade partnership between our two nations. We are profoundly grateful for Your Excellency’s unwavering support and for the UK’s commitment to inclusive economic development,” said the letter sent by FTZMA Chairman Dhammika Fernando and Secretary M.H.Z.M. Marzook.
