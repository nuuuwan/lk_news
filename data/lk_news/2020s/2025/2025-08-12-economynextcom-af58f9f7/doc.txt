Sri Lanka 2032 bond bids rejected, 2035 bonds undersold

ECONOMYNEXT – All bids for a 40 billion rupee offer of 2032 January 01 bonds were rejected, and 2035 bonds were undersold at an auction Tuesday, data from the state debt office showed.

The debt office offered 25 billion rupees of 2035 June 15 bonds and 18.53 billion rupees were sold at a weighted average yield of 10.97 percent.

There have been warnings that when private credit picks up, investors would move out of bonds if rates were cut to ‘signal’ rates down and the domestic ‘buffers’ cannot be used to suppress rates unless the money was previously deposited in the central bank as excess liquidity.

But the use of excess liquidity repay bonds would lead to forex reserve losses amid a pick up in private credit. (Colombo/Aug12/2025)
