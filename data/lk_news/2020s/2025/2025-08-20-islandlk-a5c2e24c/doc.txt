Shah Rukh Khan… in the news

Shah Rukh Khan was very much in the news, the past few weeks, especially in Sri Lanka, with most Sri Lankans eagerly awaiting his arrival, in Colombo, on 2nd August.

Of course, it didn’t happen, and none of us know the real reason for his, let’s call it, last minute cancellation.

Officially, it was stated that the cancellation was “due to unforeseen and unavoidable personal reasons beyond his control.”

It was also mentioned that he was injured on the set of ‘King’ but that was reported as false by NDTV and ‘Times of India’.

However, SRK is in the news again and this time it’s mainly in India.

Shah Rukh Khan’s National Award win for ‘Best Actor’ for his performance in ‘Jawan’ has sparked controversy. Some people were surprised that it took him 33 years to receive this honour, while others are questioning the merit behind Khan’s win.

Veteran Indian actress Urvashi, while accepting her own award for ‘Best Supporting Actress’ for ‘Ullozhukku,’ hinted at a lack of fairness in the jury’s decisions.

Urvashi questioned the National Awards jury’s decision to give Shah Rukh Khan the ‘Best Actor’ award, for his role in ‘Jawan,’ while Vijayaraghavan was categorised as ‘Best Supporting Actor’ for ‘Pookkaalam’.

She highlighted the disparity in awarding Shah Rukh Khan ‘Best Actor’ while Vijayaraghavan was given ‘Best Supporting Actor,’ despite both playing significant roles.

She expressed her dissatisfaction in an interview with  Asianet News, asking, “How did one become a supporting actor and the other the best actor? On what criteria?”

She also raised concerns about the lack of transparency in the selection process, stating that the jury’s decision should be explained to the artists. Urvashi emphasised that awards shouldn’t be accepted without question, saying, “This is not pension money that we should accept blindly”.

Additionally, she pointed out the inconsistency in categorising actors, noting that she was initially approached for a role in ‘Pookkaalam’ but declined due to the demanding physical transformation required.

Others questioned the jury’s decision-making process and timing, wondering why Khan was awarded now, despite his long-standing contributions to Indian cinema.

Some critics felt that Khan’s win was overdue, given his impactful performances in the past, while some observers believe the award might be a strategic move to co-opt Khan, given the government’s complicated relationship with Bollywood and Khan’s refusal to conform to certain expectations.

The controversy also highlights concerns about the devaluation of Indian cinema’s diversity and the erasure of dissenting voices, with some filmmakers and audiences feeling that the National Awards have become an instrument of cultural control.

Sometimes I wonder why Sri Lankans go gaga over Indian actors and actresses and treat them like royalty! Perhaps we believe in the Indian slogan ‘Neighbourhood First.’

Indian film stars do enjoy a certain level of adoration, globally, but within specific regions, particularly where Indian culture, and Indians, are prominent,

However, the notion of hero worship, across the globe, is not universally true.
