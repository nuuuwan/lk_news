President pledges reforms, economic revival in address to Sri Lankans in Maldives

President Anura Kumara Disanayake on Tuesday (29 July) reaffirmed his administration’s commitment to building a prosperous and law-abiding Sri Lanka, during a meeting with the expatriate Sri Lankan community at the Maldives National University.

Speaking at the Maldives National University Auditorium, the President outlined the Government’s key priorities—restoring rule of law, revitalising the economy, eradicating corruption, and establishing a new political culture.

Organised by the Sri Lanka High Commission in the Maldives, the event drew a large audience of Sri Lankan professionals, students, and workers. It marked the President’s first official engagement with Sri Lankans overseas since assuming office.

Disanayake stated that the overwhelming mandate his Government received in the last elections reflected the people’s call for a political transformation. “We were chosen to replace a corrupt, privileged system with one that is accountable, transparent, and people-centred,” he said.

He stressed that his administration is actively enforcing the rule of law, regardless of status or position. “From top officials in the Police and prison system to former military leaders, no one is above the law. This is the new Sri Lanka we promised, where justice is blind to privilege,” the President declared.

Disanayake also emphasised the crackdown on corruption, assuring that not a single cent of public funds would be misappropriated under his leadership. He highlighted new legislation, including the Public Property Act and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, along with improved facilities for the Bribery Commission and Attorney General’s Department, as part of efforts to ensure accountability.

On the economy, the President recounted the challenges faced upon taking office, describing the country as “economically bankrupt.” He credited the successful completion of debt restructuring and the stabilisation of the currency as pivotal achievements. “We are no longer a bankrupt nation. Agreements have been reached with creditors. Inflation is under control, interest rates are falling, and reserves have reached $ 6.3 billion,” he said, noting an expected increase to over $ 7 billion by year-end.

The President pointed out that Sri Lanka is set to record its highest-ever remittance, tourism, and export earnings in 2025. “This year will also see the resumption of major development projects from China, India, and Japan. We are rebuilding, one step at a time,” he added.

He stressed that the benefits of this macroeconomic stability must now trickle down to ordinary people. “We will use the next Budget to ensure the growth reflects in people’s lives—through education, health, and public transport improvements,” he said.

Disanayake highlighted plans to modernise the public sector and education system. He pledged that no child would leave school without an academic or vocational qualification. Public healthcare is also being expanded, with plans to establish 200 primary healthcare centres and a doctor for every Grama Niladhari Division.

On agriculture and fisheries, the President called for a transition to modern, export-oriented practices. He also discussed upcoming reforms in the energy and transport sectors, including the conversion of power plants to liquefied natural gas (LNG) and improved public transit.

Disanayake assured the expatriate community that their issues, including challenges in repatriating bodies and visa regulations, are being addressed. “The Maldivian President has agreed to extend 90-day visas. Every Sri Lankan, wherever they are, will be cared for by this Government,” he said.

In closing, the President urged all Sri Lankans to unite in building a stronger nation. “We are not here because of privilege or wealth. We are here because of the people. And we will repay that trust by transforming this country together.”
