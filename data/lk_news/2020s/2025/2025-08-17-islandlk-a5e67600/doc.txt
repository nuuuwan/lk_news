Sri Lanka striving to win back investors on world stage

At the recent Invest Sri Lanka Investor Forum held at Conrad Singapore Marina Bay, Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) Director Ray Abeywardena set the tone with a powerful message: “Sri Lanka is not merely a story of recovery, it is a story of transformation.”

His remarks captured the essence of the forum, which showcased Sri Lanka’s stable macroeconomic environment, sweeping reforms, and a resurgent capital market – positioning Sri Lanka as a compelling frontier investment destination. The event, organised by the CSE and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) in partnership with the Sri Lankan High Commission in Singapore, attracted over 150 investors, sparking immediate market optimism with Rs. 1 billion in foreign-led trades the next morning.

Abeywardena emphasised that Sri Lanka’s revival goes beyond post-crisis stabilisation. “This is a moment of alignment between policy, performance, and potential,” he said, highlighting opportunities in infrastructure, digital finance, and equity markets. His optimism was echoed by Central Bank Governor Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, who noted that debt restructuring is nearing completion, with a potential sovereign rating upgrade from CCC+ to ‘B’, making early investment crucial.

Prof. Anil J. Fernando, Minister of Labour and Deputy Minister of Economic Development, outlined Sri Lanka’s investment-led growth strategy, targeting sectors like energy, tourism, and logistics. He assured investors of clean governance and policy consistency, key to rebuilding confidence.

Meanwhile, SEC Chairman Prof. D.B.P.H. Dissabandara made a bold case for capital market financing, citing John Keells Holdings’ $1.4 billion raise for Cinnamon Life as proof of the market’s potential. “If corporates can do it, why not the government?” he asked, advocating for market-driven solutions to fuel growth.

Two panel discussions moderated by Bloomberg’s Avril Hong and Farringdon Asset Management’s Ana Isabel Gonzalez – delved into Sri Lanka’s economic resilience and equity market prospects. Key takeaways included:

The forum closed with one-on-one meetings between Sri Lankan corporates and global investors, setting the stage for future partnerships. The forum was supported by the Singapore Sri Lanka Business Association, CFA Society Sri Lanka, and Sri Lankan Airlines.
