Sri Lanka’s plantation giants embrace regenerative agriculture in landmark shift

Agreements with global sustainability body set to transform 36,000 hectares of tea

In a transformative move for the nation’s plantation economy, four of Sri Lanka’s leading agricultural companies recently signed landmark agreements in Colombo to adopt regenerative farming practices. The partnerships with Solidaridad Network Asia and its local partner, Nucleus Foundation, will position the island’s crucial tea sector to access valuable carbon markets and meet stringent new EU import regulations.

Hayleys Plantations, Aitken Spence’s Elpitiya Plantations PLC, and Lumbini Tea Valley Ceylon will implement the globally recognised Regenagri standard across nearly 36,000 hectares of tea estates. One of the largest initiatives of its kind in Sri Lanka, it directly addresses declining yields and climate vulnerability by integrating traditional wisdom with modern technology.

The Regenagri framework will enable companies to generate and trade Carbon Removal Units (CRUs), creating a direct economic incentive for sustainable land management. This is strategically vital for complying with the European Union’s Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) and Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD).

“Sustainable development is our core policy,” said Hayleys Plantations Managing Director Dr. Roshan Rajadurai at a press conference following the signing of its MoU with the global sustainability body on August 12. “This framework allows us to preserve our environment by blending ancient practices with modern techniques for the benefit of both the land and our workforce.”

Dr. Shatadru Chattopadhayay, Managing Director of Solidaridad Asia, stated, “These MoUs mark a decisive shift, moving beyond mere compliance to build climate-resilient value chains prepared for evolving global regulations.”

The implementation will use digital tools to monitor soil health, biodiversity, and water usage, providing verifiable data for international buyers. The local expertise of the Nucleus Foundation will ensure effective community engagement across the diverse estates involved.

With the potential to generate approximately 100,000 tCO2e, in carbon credits annually, the initiative creates a compelling economic case for sustainable agriculture.

The pioneers of these MoUs anticipate it could catalyse similar shifts in Sri Lanka’s rubber and coconut sectors, securing the country’s future in sustainability-conscious global markets.
