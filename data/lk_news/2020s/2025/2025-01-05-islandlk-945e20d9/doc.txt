Nestlé Coconut Development Plan supports 500 more rural families in Northern Province

The Nestlé Coconut Development Plan was expanded recently, benefiting 500 rural families in the Northern Province. Conducted for the eighth year running in collaboration with the Coconut Cultivation Board of Sri Lanka (CCB), the programme has supported approximately 5,000 home-growers with hybrid coconut plantlets and other resources with the ambition of expanding coconut cultivation in Sri Lanka. This programme has also taken measures to train beneficiaries on best practices of coconut cultivation by conducting on-ground training programmes and providing fertilizer for cultivation.

Sharing his thoughts on this public-private partnership, Regional Manager – Vavuniya of the Coconut Cultivation Board, Mr. Manjula Hewamalawi said “Over the years, this worthy initiative has been instrumental in encouraging coconut cultivation in non-traditional coconut growing areas and has served as a platform for sharing knowledge, which has helped improve cultivation techniques, address challenges, and explore new avenues for coconut cultivation.”
