Hospitality, Holiness & Human Flourishing: A Christian Response To LGBTIQ Tourism

The recent endorsement of LGBTIQ tourism in Sri Lanka raises questions of morality, economics, and cultural identity. This article offers a Christian response through three themes: hospitality, holiness, and human flourishing. It affirms the dignity of all people created in God’s image, while upholding God’s original design for life, marriage, and family. True flourishing cannot be reduced to economics or inclusivity alone but is found in spiritual, intellectual, social, emotional, and moral  development of the nation and the new life offered in Jesus Christ through repentance and transformation.

Tourism has become one of Sri Lanka’s most vital economic lifelines, especially in the nation’s pursuit of recovery and global integration. Recently, Sri Lanka Tourism endorsed an initiative to promote LGBTIQ tourism. At first glance, this may appear progressive, inclusive, and profitable. Yet for the the larger community, such developments must be discerned not only economically but also morally, socially, and spiritually.

The Bible calls the church to be “salt and light” (Matthew 5:13–16)—preserving God’s truth, shining the light of Christ, and brining hope and transformation to our society darkened by moral decay and socio-cultural decline. This article reflects on the issue of LGBTIQ tourism through three biblical lenses: hospitality, holiness, and human flourishing. These categories allow us to affirm human dignity, uphold God’s standards, and seek the genuine well-being of our society.

Christian witness begins with the conviction that every person is created in the image of God (Genesis 1:27). Though this image is broken by sin (Genesis 3), the image of God in humans remains the foundation of human worth and dignity. This truth compels us to treat all people with respect, compassion, and justice. For this reason, the church must avoid hostility or discrimination against LGBTIQ persons. Our first response is always love, for Jesus taught us to love our neighbor as ourselves (Matthew 22:37–39). Love and hospitality are at the heart of biblical faith. From Abraham’s welcome of strangers to Jesus’ table of fellowship with outcasts, Scripture calls us to reflect God’s generous love in our relationships.

The Christian response must therefore begin with compassion. Many LGBTIQ persons face deep struggles—stigma, rejection, depression, and isolation. In such circumstances, pastoral care, prayer, professional counseling and safe spaces for honest conversation become essential expressions of Christian love.

Hospitality alone, however, is not enough. Without truth, love becomes sentimentality. The Bible presents a clear vision of God’s design for human life and sexuality. From the beginning, marriage was established as a covenantal union between one man and one woman (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4–6). This covenant embodies intimacy, faithfulness, and fruitfulness: the gift of companionship, the shaping of character, and the blessing of procreation.

Sexual expression outside this design—whether heterosexual or homosexual—falls short of God’s intention and is consistently portrayed in Scripture as contrary to His will (Romans 1:24–27; 1 Corinthians 6:9–11). God’s design protects not only personal holiness but also safeguards the family as the foundation of society.

At the heart of this design is God’s holiness. Scripture declares: “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty” (Isaiah 6:3; Revelation 4:8). Holiness is the moral foundation of human existence. Violation of this foundation has consequences. There is ethical demand on humanity, calling us to be set apart from sin and dedicate our lives to God: “Be holy, because I am holy” (Leviticus 11:44; 1 Peter 1:16).

Inclusivity, though a noble value, cannot redefine holiness. When societies attempt to reshape morality for economic reasons, they drift into confusion. Prophet Isaiah warned: “Woe to those who call evil good and good evil” (Isaiah 5:20). If Sri Lanka embraces policies that normalize practices contrary to God’s design, it risks eroding its moral foundations and reshaping its national identity around contested values.

Tourism may bring short-term financial gains, but economy alone is not sufficient for holistic well-being. Human beings, created in God’s image, are moral, spiritual, intellectual, psychological, and social beings. Economic profit cannot replace human flourishing; no GDP can heal broken families, moral confusion, or spiritual emptiness. To reduce human flourishing to mere economic profit alone strips life of its true purpose.

For a society to truly thrive, it must pursue justice, cultivate morality, nurture spirituality, and sustain psychological, intellectual and social stability alongside economic development. When financial policies ignore these dimensions, they risk undermining the very foundations of human civilization. A nation may grow richer in economic prosperity, but without morality, integrity, compassion, and purpose, it is destined to fail.

* Continuity of Civilization: Families rooted in male–female complementarity provide the natural context where children are born, holistically nurtured, and shaped for society. Weakening this structure undermines generational stability.

* Moral Clarity: When financial incentives are allowed to redefine morality, society loses the ability to discern what fosters life and what leads to destruction.

* National Image: As Sri Lanka seeks global integration, we must ask: Is LGBTIQ tourism a sustainable and appropriate development strategy? What image will it project internationally, and how will it reshape our cultural and social identity?

Human flourishing also requires responding to the real struggles of LGBTIQ persons. Many face stress, depression, and healthcare issues. In such a context, our response must combine truth with compassion: offering pastoral care, professional support, and the Gospel’s invitation to repentance and transformation. Apostle Paul reminded the Corinthian church: “And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ” (1 Corinthians 6:11). This redemptive hope is available to all people.

* Provide pastoral care – creating safe, compassionate spaces for those wrestling with identity and sexuality.

* Speak prophetically – reminding the nation that inclusivity must not blur God’s moral boundaries.

* Model authentic hospitality – welcoming those affected with kindness while remaining faithful to God’s Word.

* Engage missionally – witnessing with compassion and integrity, offering the hope of new life in Christ to everyone who believes.

Responsible advocacy – urging policymakers to weigh ethical, cultural, and generational consequences when shaping national identity around contested moral issues.

The endorsement of LGBTIQ tourism in Sri Lanka cannot be viewed merely as an economic opportunity. While inclusivity and financial growth are important, they cannot replace the deeper realities of God’s design, moral integrity, and social responsibility. A Christian response must hold together hospitality, holiness, and human flourishing in this broken world. We are called to love our neighbors, uphold God’s standards, and seek the true well-being of individuals and society. Proverbs 14:34 reminds us: “Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people.”

As a Christian community, we are committed to praying for Sri Lanka’s holistic restoration—its leaders, its people, and its future—trusting that Christ’s truth and grace can heal, transform, and bring lasting peace to our nation.
