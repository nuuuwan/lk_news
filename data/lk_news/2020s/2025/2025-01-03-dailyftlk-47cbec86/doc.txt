Gayantha criticises AKD Govt.’s 100-day performance

Says Govt. promised to deliver relief to people such as reducing fuel prices and electricity tariffs within 24 hours

Accuses Govt. of failing to fulfil these pledges despite enjoying two thirds majority

Slams Govt. for prioritising personal agendas over public welfare and calls for urgent measures to address growing economic and social challenges

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Gayantha Karunathilaka yesterday lambasted the National People’s Power (NPP) Government, claiming it has failed to deliver on its promises within its first 100 days in office.

“The NPP had assured the public during election campaigns that relief measures such as reducing fuel prices, lowering electricity bills, and eliminating unfair taxes would be implemented immediately. They even said these could be achieved with the stroke of a pen in just 24 hours. Yet, despite enjoying over two-thirds parliamentary power, the Government has not fulfilled these pledges,” Karunathilaka said addressing a press conference.

He compared the current Government’s performance to that of the former Yahapalana administration, which, according to him, accomplished significant milestones within its first 100 days despite lacking a parliamentary majority. “The Good Governance Government increased public sector salaries by Rs. 10,000, reduced oil prices, lowered electricity bills, and passed progressive legislation, including the Right to Information Act, all within a short span,” he highlighted.

Karunathilaka also criticised the NPP for its inability to address the ongoing rice shortage and the soaring prices of essential goods. “Today, people are struggling to purchase basic commodities like rice, coconut, and salt, especially during the festive season. The Government’s price controls have backfired, benefiting large-scale traders instead of the public,” he said.

The MP expressed concern over the rising cost of living, pointing to increased VAT on school supplies and a lack of support for low-income families. “Parents are spending exorbitant amounts on school equipment, and the promised Rs. 6,000 allowance for children from low-income families has not materialised for most. This Government’s actions have made life harder for the people,” he added. Karunathilaka further criticised the Government’s handling of senior citizens’ interests.

“The promise to provide an additional five percent interest concession on deposits for senior citizens has been forgotten. Instead, the interest rate has been reduced to 7.5%, creating financial hardships for those who depend on these savings,” he said.

Karunathilaka accused the Government of prioritising personal agendas over public welfare and called for urgent measures to address the growing economic and social challenges faced by the people.
