Solutions Ground pioneers Sri Lanka’s first CSR outsourcing model

In a novel approach that redefines Sri Lankan businesses’ approach to strategic corporate social responsibility, Solutions Ground Ltd., has unveiled the country’s first full-service CSR outsourcing model.

Headquartered in Sri Lanka and operating regionally, Solutions Ground is an international boutique consultancy working at the intersection of business, policy, and sustainability. Its latest offering introduces a fully outsourced approach to CSR, giving companies access to dedicated external expertise to design, implement, communicate, and evaluate purpose-driven programs.

Solutions Ground, already recognised for its work in business consultancy, leadership development, culture transformation, employer branding, and sales coaching, is now carving out a new space in the market by positioning CSR as a service that can be outsourced similar to advertising, public relations, or legal counsel. The decision stems from a growing recognition that while ESG expectations continue to rise globally, many Sri Lankan businesses still lack the internal structure, expertise, or bandwidth to manage strategic CSR meaningfully. The result is often shallow, inconsistent, or performative social responsibility that fails to deliver value to either community or brand.

“There’s a critical gap in the market,” said Solutions Ground Founder and CEO Lakshan Madurasinghe. “What we’ve seen across industries is that strategic corporate sustainability often falls by the wayside, not because companies don’t care, but because they don’t have the team or the budget to hire in-house specialists. It becomes something managed off the side, a tick in the box. But CSR, like advertising or PR, is a function that can be outsourced to people who live and breathe this work. It’s already happening globally. This is about making that same model available in Sri Lanka, with rigour and accountability.”

Solutions Ground’s model is designed to offer an end-to-end approach, from strategy and partner sourcing to program management, stakeholder engagement, and reporting. Clients will have access to a dedicated team comprising development consultants, communication strategists, and ground-level operatives without needing to build those capabilities internally. The agency will work across thematic pillars including education, youth development, environmental sustainability, inclusive hiring, and ethical supply chains, ensuring programs are not only high-impact but also aligned with evolving ESG and SDG standards.

This move comes at a time when businesses are under increasing pressure to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability not just in reports, but in actual practice. “With a changing consumer base, heightened media scrutiny, and international compliance requirements, companies need more than goodwill. They need structured, visible, and long-term action. Solutions Ground’s offering responds to that urgency,” added Solutions Ground Sustainability Head Lalithra Wickramasinghe.

The consultancy is already in talks with leading firms in education, hospitality, FMCG, and tech to design pilots that will evolve into signature CSR platforms. Organisations interested in outsourcing their CSR strategy and implementation can now engage Solutions Ground as a long-term partner.
