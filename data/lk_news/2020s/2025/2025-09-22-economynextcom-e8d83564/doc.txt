GovPay boosts traffic fine payments in Sri Lanka: Official

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has seen an increase in traffic fine payments since GovPay, the state digital payment platform, was implemented in the Western Province, an official involved in the initiative has said.

“Traffic fine payments via GovPay continue to climb, with yesterday recording the highest volume since the Western Province went live,” Harsha Purasinghe, Board Director of ICTA, said on the social media platform X.

GovPay lets citizens and businesses make digital payments for government services like taxes, fines, and utility bills through banks and digital wallets.

The initiative is a collaboration between LankaPay and the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA).

“While GovPay is delivering unmatched convenience and transparency for citizens, Sri Lanka Police plans to introduce a demerit points system in the future, alongside digital payments,” Purasinghe said.

Last week, the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) joined GovPay, allowing tourism industry operators across the country pay the Tourism Development Levy and other payments through their banks’ internet and mobile banking portals or any FinTech app connected to GovPay.
