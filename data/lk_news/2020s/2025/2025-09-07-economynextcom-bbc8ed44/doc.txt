Sri Lanka to install barrier nets in 250 reservoirs to boost fish stocks

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is planning to install barrier nets in 250 reservoirs to protect fish stocks and boost harvests, Cabinet spokesman Nalinda Jayatissa said.

An estimated 20,000 to 40,000 kilograms are washed way annually from each reservoir when water is released for agriculture, reducing fish harvest for human consumption.

The loss of mature fish in of reproductive age also leads to depletion of fish stocks.

The cabinet of ministers had approved a plan by the National Aquaculture Development Authority of Sri Lanka to install barrier nets in 250 freshwater tanks, which will lead to better harvest and protein availability in rural areas.

Sri Lanka has high taxes on imported foods, especially in dairy and maize to promote ‘self-sufficiency’ leading to extraordinarily high dairy goods prices and also meat. (Colombo/Aug07/2025)
