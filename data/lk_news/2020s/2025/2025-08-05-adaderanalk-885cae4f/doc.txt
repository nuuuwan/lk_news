“No threat to National Security”: Defence Secretary

There is currently no threat to national security, says the Secretary of the Ministry of Defence Air Vice Marshal Sampath Thuyacontha (Retd).

The Defence Secretary made this statement while attending an event in Colombo.

He further stated that underworld activities are not directly related to national security, and that such matters are being handled by the Ministry of Public Security.

Speaking to media, the Defence Secretary said, “There is no threat to national security. You were able to come here today without any issues, weren’t you? The underworld is not something directly connected to national security. It’s managed by the Ministry of Public Security. Within the limits of what’s needed for national security and what the police require, we are providing support. There is no threat to national security. The underworld is unsettled. And it should be unsettled — because it no longer has political protection. That’s why they’re in disarray. Those involved in underworld activities are being arrested. The Ministry of Public Security is executing a plan. We are supporting it within the legal framework and within our scope.”
