Sri Lanka and Oman team up to counter money laundering

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka central bank’s Financial Intelligence Unit has entered into a memorandum of understanding with the National Center for Financial Information in the Sultanate of Oman to share information on money laundering and terrorist financing.

“This MOU facilitates the exchange of financial intelligence related to money laundering (ML), associated predicate offences, and terrorist financing (TF), in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 6 of 2006,” the central bank said.

Financial Intelligence Units around the world enter into MOUs to foster cooperation with their international counterparts by sharing information, the monetary authority pointed out.

“This collaboration is vital in the global fight against ML/TF, which often involves complex cross-border criminal networks.”

The NCFI-Oman is mandated to receive, analyze and request reports and information, suspected of being related or linked to proceeds of crime, ML or TF activities.

The FIU-Sri Lanka serves as the focal point for Anti Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework for Sri Lanka and collects, analyses and disseminates information on suspicious financial transactions relating to ML/TF or any other unlawful activities.

“With the signing of this MOU, the FIU-Sri Lanka has now entered into MOUs with 46 foreign counterparts for sharing of information for intelligence purposes.”

The FIU-Sri Lanka and NCFI-Oman signed the agreement on July 9, during the 31st Plenary of the Egmont Group, held in Luxembourg. (Colombo/Jul16/2025)
