Sri Lanka CB chief says no plans to limit car imports

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka Central Bank and has no plans to limits vehicle imports, and to his knowledge neither did the government, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) earlier this month said high-frequency data have suggested a steady growth in motor vehicle imports after the removal of import restrictions on February 1, with around 675 million dollar in letters of credit opened by June 10.

“There is no concern from the central bank on vehicle imports. There is no limit and the open market will continue for vehicle imports,” Governor Weerasinghe told reporters at a post-monetary policy media brief on Wednesday.

“The government also is not against that idea as far as I know.”

The Central Bank before vehicle imports started informed the Finance Ministry that the country could import up to 1 billion dollar worth vehicles this year. (Colombo/July 23/2025)
