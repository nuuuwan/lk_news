Tall buildings sans flashing white strobe lights: “If you think air safety is expensive, try an accident’

The tall building, shown in Figure 1, near Temple Trees, Colombo 3, has a flashing white strobe light as recommended by International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) law.However, the Nelum Kuluna (Lotus Tower), the highest man-made object in Colombo, though equipped, does not switch on any lights during the day.

These flashing white hazard lights are present in all cities with tall buildings all over the world like Paris (Eiffel Tower), Sydney (Centre Point) and Toronto (CN Tower) as attention –getters. Except in Sri Lanka where during the day there may be helicopters carrying patients to the National Hospital and tourists to hotels, overflying the city of Colombo.

This has been pointed out by the National Issues Committee of the Organisation of Professional Association (OPA) on many occasions, but in vain.

The principles of being Predictive, Preventive and Proactive are essential for air safety.
