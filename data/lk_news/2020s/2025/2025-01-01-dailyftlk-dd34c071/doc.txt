Centrum Marine Consultancy Ltd., a leader in maritime HR and a strong advocate for gender diversity, has been awarded the prestigious “Empowering Diversified Maritime Education” accolade at the 5th annual Maritime SheEO Conference. This recognition celebrates their groundbreaking initiative, “She Can Sail the Seas”, Sri Lanka’s first female cadetship program, launched in partnership with Peter Döhle Schiffahrts-KG. This award reaffirms Centrum Marine Consultancy’s commitment to bridging the gender gap in maritime and creating equal opportunities for women at sea.

The Maritime SheEO Conference, held at the TAJ Santacruz in Mumbai under the theme “Setting Sail for Equality: Empowering Women Leaders,” brought together global CXOs to champion diversity and inclusivity in the maritime industry. Centrum Marine Consultancy stood out for its innovative approach to promoting gender diversity and fostering a more inclusive workforce.

Launched in 2023, She Can Sail the Seas provides full scholarships worth $ 110,000 to 15 aspiring female cadets. The program combines academic training, practical experience, and the development of essential soft skills, preparing participants for successful maritime careers. By 2029, the initiative aims to produce 200 female officers, transforming Sri Lanka’s maritime sector and underscoring the vast potential of women in the industry.

Centrum Marine Consultancy Managing Director Kalinga De Silva stated, “She Can Sail the Seas is more than just a training program; it’s a movement for change. Our vision is to create opportunities that inspire, empower, and support women in their maritime careers.

This recognition affirms our commitment to fostering a more inclusive industry. Our goal is not just to produce skilled cadets but to shape future leaders who will inspire the next generation of female seafarers.”

The program emphasises holistic development, offering cadets leadership training camps, as well as skill-building sessions in areas such as speech craft, physical fitness, mindfulness, and English language enhancement.

Notable female mentors, including US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung, Naval Attaché to the US Embassy in Sri Lanka Lieutenant Commander Jessica De Mont; and Commodore Nandani Wijedoru of the Sri Lankan Navy, provided invaluable guidance and real-world insights, empowering cadets to excel in their careers.

The success of She Can Sail the Seas serves as a call to action for the maritime industry to embrace similar initiatives. Centrum Marine Consultancy and Peter Döhle Schiffahrts-KG continue to inspire change, showcasing how collaboration and commitment can drive meaningful progress in traditionally male-dominated sectors. CINEC campus served as the technical partner in this collaboration.
