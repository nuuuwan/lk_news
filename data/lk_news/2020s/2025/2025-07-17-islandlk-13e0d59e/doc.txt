Mid-year outlook 2025: Steady but slow growth

Rate Cut Expected in 3Q2025: First Capital Research (FCR) anticipates a 25bps reduction by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to counter slow economic growth and align inflation with the 5% target. This is supported by:

Improved market liquidity (LKR 150Bn) and reserve strengthening (USD 7.0Bn forecasted), aided by multilateral inflows .

– Yield curve adjustments: 1Yr yields revised down by 100bps, while 5Yr and 10Yr yields lowered by 50bps. With rates near revised lower bounds, further downside is limited.

Recommendation: Shift to short-tenure bonds and maintain a carry portfolio to capitalize on stable yields.

– 2H2025: Rates expected to decline to 7.5%–8.5% post-potential rate cut.

-1H2026: Gradual rise to 8.0%–9.0% due to increased credit demand from private and state sectors, tightening liquidity.

Near Term (2025): LKR/USD stabilizes around 300, supported by CBSL’s USD purchases and a positive current account balance.

– 2025 Fair Value Upgraded 18,000–19,000 (from 8.6x to 10.0x PE), driven by:

– 25% YoY earnings growth in listed corporates (e.g., John Keells Holdings’ mega projects, F&B, and banking sector recovery).

– Prolonged low-interest environment boosting equity inflows from alternative assets.

– 2026 Forecast: New fair value of 21,000–22,000, assuming sustained earnings momentum and investor confidence .

– Global Policy Uncertainty: Fed/ECB rate trajectories may impact capital flows .
