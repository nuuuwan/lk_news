‘Mangata Galle combines personalised Ayurveda and bespoke luxury’

Mangata Galle has been unveiled as the latest jewel in the Adhitya Ayurveda family, adding a new dimension of wellness and luxury to the historic city of Galle. This expansion is a significant achievement for the company in meeting its goal of spreading the essence of Ayurveda and traditional medicine across Sri Lanka.

Mangata is conveniently-located in the historic city of Galle and offers the perfect blend of privacy and adventure to guests looking to combine Ayurveda, culture and exploration. While the retreat provides an oasis of peace and tranquillity, its proximity to the Dutch Galle Fort, a UNESCO-World Heritage site, allows guests to delve into the region’s cultural richness, creating a balanced experience of relaxation and adventure.

Sharing his views, Ranuka Karunarathne – Chief Executive Officer of Adhitya Ayurveda stated, “We are excited by the launch of our latest retreat – Mangata Galle – which offers a sanctuary of wellness and bespoke luxury in the historic city of Galle. This boutique retreat marries Sri Lanka’s ancient Hela Wedakama traditions with contemporary comforts, redefining the holistic healing experience for our valued guests.”

Every guest’s journey at Mangata begins with a personalised consultation by highly-experienced Ayurvedic physicians. Using the ancient principles of the tridoshas – vata (air and space), pitta (fire and water), and kapha (water and earth) – the medical team identifies each guest’s imbalances and tailors a wellness programme to them. This bespoke approach ensures that every treatment aligns with the guest’s unique physical and emotional needs.

Mangata’s treatment rooms are designed for tranquillity and precision and offers therapies ranging from herbal oil massages (abhyanga) to detoxifying wraps and steam baths enriched with medicinal herbs. These age-old practices harmonise the body, mind, and spirit, creating a pathway to renewal and vitality. Adding to the retreat’s holistic offerings are its dedicated yoga and meditation areas. Guests can enjoy serene yoga sessions in the garden by the beach, where the gentle rhythm of the waves enhances mindfulness and relaxation. Specially designed meditation spaces provide a haven for reflection and inner peace, perfectly complementing the retreat’s wellness therapies.

The culinary experience at Mangata is a journey into Sri Lanka’s rich gastronomic heritage. Every meal is crafted with locally sourced organic ingredients, adhering to Ayurvedic principles that promote balance and digestion. Guests can savour traditional Sri Lankan delicacies, from fragrant curries to fresh tropical fruits and herbal teas, all tailored to support their healing journey while celebrating the island’s vibrant flavours.

Yasas Gunawardhane – Director of Adhitya Ayurveda shared his thoughts, commenting, “At Mangata, our dedication to personalised care and holistic healing reflects the core ethos of Adhitya Ayurveda. We invite guests to embark on a transformative journey by experiencing our bespoke treatments, unique culinary offerings, and serene spaces for yoga and meditation. This is more than just a retreat; it is an invitation to rediscover balance, vitality, and the art of mindful living.”

The Adhitya Ayurveda family also includes one of Sri Lanka’s leading holistic healing and luxury resort nestled in the heart of Anuradhapura. It is an ISO-certified, award-winning retreat where ancient Ayurvedic wisdom and Sri Lankan traditional medicine are combined. Adhitya Ayurveda has also opened Adhitya Ayurveda Colombo, situated in the vibrant locale of Colombo 3. ( Mangata Galle )
