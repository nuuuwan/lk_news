In an astonishing display of resilience and community spirit, Kandurata Umbrella Industries Ltd., announced this week that it has resumed production at its Gampola factory, less than a month after a devastating fire completely destroyed the facility.

The blaze, which occurred on 28 July 2025, razed the entire manufacturing plant, wiping out the building, critical production equipment, and inventory for the iconic ‘Penguin’ brand.

The incident was seen as a major blow to the nearly 50-year-old company, a household name in Sri Lanka and a significant employer in the Gampola region.

However, in what is being hailed as a remarkable comeback, the company has managed to restart its operations in record time.

In an official statement, the Board of Directors credited the rapid recovery to the “extraordinary” dedication of its employees and the “unwavering support” of partners, customers, and the local community.

The statement also confirmed that they have “resumed production in Gampola within just one month of the incident.”

This swift turnaround is a powerful testament to the company’s robust foundations and deep community ties.

The company’s board expressed immense gratitude for the solidarity shown during the crisis, stating that the experience reaffirmed that “Kandurata Umbrella Industries is more than a company, it is a community.”

They have vowed to emerge from this challenge stronger than ever, continuing their mission to deliver exceptional products and invest in the nation.
