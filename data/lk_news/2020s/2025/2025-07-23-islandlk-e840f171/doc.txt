Beyond the Echo Chamber: Why diversity is Sri Lanka’s ultimate strategic asset

In a nation standing at a crossroads of economic recovery and social reconciliation, the dialogue surrounding diversity and inclusion has never been more critical. Moving beyond its frequent characterization as a Western corporate buzzword, a recent high-level discussion framed diversity as a cornerstone for Sri Lanka’s future prosperity and unity. The second day of the International HR Conference, hosted by the Chartered Institute of Personnel Management (CIPM) Sri Lanka on June 3rd at the Monarch Imperial in Kotte, convened a powerhouse panel of business leaders to dissect the theme, “Diversity for Creativity: Strengthening Social Cohesion.” The conversation that unfolded was a masterclass in shifting the narrative from diversity as a compliance metric to diversity as a strategic, non-negotiable imperative for innovation and national healing.

The panel, expertly moderated by CIPM President and Siam City Cement Lanka’s Chief People Officer, Priyantha Ranasinghe, featured a formidable lineup of minds: Rajendra Theagarajah, the astute Independent Non-Executive Chairman of First Capital Holdings PLC; Sabrina Esufally, the dynamic Managing Director of Hemas Consumer Brands; Tamali Rodrigo, Partner and Head of Restructuring and Corporate Governance at KPMG Sri Lanka & Maldives; and Shalin Balasuriya, the visionary Co-Founder and Group Director of Spa Ceylon Ayurveda Wellness. Together, they argued that for Sri Lanka to thrive, its boardrooms, product lines, and social fabric must begin to reflect the rich tapestry of its people.

Priyantha Ranasinghe initiated the discourse by acknowledging a crucial gap: while conversations around Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) are gaining traction in Sri Lanka, the nation’s corporate sector lags significantly behind global benchmarks in implementation. He set a powerful tone, urging leaders to transcend performative gestures and embed DEI into the very DNA of their corporate strategy.

Rajendra Theagarajah, drawing upon decades of experience in the banking sector, immediately gave this call a tangible form. He argued that intentional diversity, particularly in leadership, is a direct catalyst for superior decision-making. “The quality of a decision fundamentally improves when it is informed by a variety of perspectives,” he asserted. He shared a compelling case study from his career where the strategic recruitment of young people from rural communities to serve those same communities resulted in a more empathetic, effective, and ultimately profitable service model. The lesson was clear and profound: “Diversity must mirror your stakeholders.” For a business to truly understand its market, it must first understand the people within it.

Shalin Balasuriya, whose brand Spa Ceylon has taken Sri Lankan wellness to the global stage, echoed this sentiment. He emphasized that authentic market intelligence is not born from spreadsheets and data analytics alone. “Cultural insights don’t come from data—they come from people. From lived experiences,” he explained. He contended that building an internal team that reflects the consumer base is the first step to genuine innovation. Such an inclusive environment, he argued, not only sparks creativity but also cultivates profound team cohesion and loyalty—a crucial asset in any competitive industry.

For Sabrina Esufally, DEI is not a “nice-to-have” but a core driver of market growth. “If you treat diversity as a compliance, tick-box exercise, you will never unlock its true, transformative value,” she warned. She detailed how Hemas Consumer Brands strategically repositioned its innovation pipeline by asking a simple yet revolutionary question: “Who is the market not solving for?” This inquiry led them to the “margins,” where immense growth opportunities lay hidden in plain sight. By identifying and addressing the unmet needs of underserved populations—such as the lack of access to affordable sanitary products in rural areas or disparities in oral healthcare—the company unlocked new revenue streams while simultaneously fostering greater equity. “Growth happens at the margins,” Esufally declared, positioning inclusion as a powerful engine for business expansion.

Bringing a rigorous consulting perspective, Tamali Rodrigo underscored that in the realm of professional services, cognitive diversity is not merely advantageous—it is essential. “Diverse teams consistently deliver better, more robust solutions. It’s not optional for success,” she stated. However, she cautioned that building such teams requires a structured, deliberate approach. This includes actively managing resistance to change, codifying inclusive policies, and—critically—holding teams accountable through DEI-related Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). “Inclusion isn’t a special project,” Rodrigo insisted. “It must be embedded in how we work every single day.”

The discussion then pivoted from the boardroom to the foundational pillars of society, exploring how true inclusion must be nurtured long before an individual’s first job interview. The panelists unanimously agreed that the roots of division, and therefore the seeds of unity, are planted in childhood.

Rajendra Theagarajah spoke with passion about the urgent need to start at the level of early childhood education. He described Rotary-led initiatives that train preschool teachers by intentionally bringing together educators from different regions, ethnicities, and linguistic backgrounds. The transformation was often profound. “By the third day, they were in tears, hugging each other,” he recounted. “It’s not hate that divides us—it’s unfamiliarity.” He also pointed to sports, citing events like the Harmony Cup cricket tournament, as powerful platforms for dismantling social barriers by fostering interaction and shared purpose among youth from different communities.

Shalin Balasuriya reinforced this, identifying the family unit as the primary incubator for inclusive thinking. “Home is where children first learn about difference—about festivals, cultures, and empathy,” he said. He recalled his own formative experiences in scouting and school sports, which enabled him to build friendships that transcended ethnic and social boundaries. “Interaction is the antidote to division,” he concluded.

Sabrina Esufally offered a sharper critique of the current system, arguing that diversity must be normalized, not spotlighted as an exception. “When difference is constantly presented as ‘other,’ it inevitably becomes a point of contention,” she explained. She condemned the structural segregation present in the education system, where children from Sinhala and Tamil backgrounds can attend the same institution for years without ever meaningfully engaging. “We need decisive policy changes to undo this structural separation,” she insisted, calling for systemic reform in curriculum, public policy, and leadership mindsets to construct a genuinely inclusive Sri Lanka.

Translating noble intentions into organizational reality requires a deliberate and sustained effort. Tamali Rodrigo shared a powerful example from KPMG, where a mentorship program paired a new recruit who had communication difficulties with a supportive team. By placing him in a role that leveraged his analytical prowess, he thrived, ultimately uncovering significant financial irregularities that others had missed. “We would have missed his extraordinary talent had we not consciously created the space for him to succeed,” she reflected.

This principle of adapting the environment to the individual, rather than forcing the individual to conform, was a recurring theme. Shalin Balasuriya shared Spa Ceylon’s success with an inclusive training program for hearing- and speech-impaired individuals. With the right support systems, these employees not only met but exceeded performance expectations.

The conversation also tackled the more sensitive, yet crucial, dimensions of inclusion. Esufally urged companies to move beyond creating passive ‘safe spaces’ for LGBTQ+ employees and instead foster a culture of genuine celebration. “When people are forced to hide a part of who they are, you lose their full potential, their full creativity,” she stated. “Difference isn’t a liability—it’s your competitive edge.”

To ensure these efforts are not merely anecdotal, Theagarajah advocated for robust data practices to drive accountability. “Track your metrics on gender, ethnicity, disability, and representation at all levels. Tie these DEI metrics directly to performance evaluations and leadership bonuses,” he urged. “In progressive global markets, DEI reporting directly impacts investor confidence and even share price. It’s not just ethical—it’s strategic finance.”

The path to a more innovative, resilient, and cohesive Sri Lanka is paved with intentional inclusion. It requires leaders who are brave enough to challenge the status quo, to look beyond their echo chambers, and to design organizations and policies that reflect the nation’s true diversity.

The panelists’ message was unequivocal: diversity is not a soft, feel-good initiative but a hard-edged strategic tool. It is the key to unlocking new markets, building resilient teams, making smarter decisions, and healing societal rifts. As Sabrina Esufally powerfully summarized, “Innovation doesn’t come from sameness.” For Sri Lanka, embracing this truth is not just smart business—it is the most vital investment it can make in its future.
