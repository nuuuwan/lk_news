SEC defers trading suspension of Millennium Housing Developers

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has granted deferment of the securities trading suspension of Millennium Housing Developers PLC (MHDL) until further notice, a Colombo stock market filing said yesterday.

“Further to the notice published on 21 August 2025 regarding the trading suspension of MHDL, please note that, since the company has requested a deferment from the SEC in terms of Rule 7.5(d)(ii) A.12 of the CSE Listing Rules, the trading of the said security will not be suspended until further notice,” the filing said.

The trading suspension, now deferred, was to take effect yesterday due to the matter of going concern in the Independent Auditor’s Report in the company’s audited statements for the year ended 31 March 2023.
