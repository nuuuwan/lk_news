Nepal Protests: No consensus yet on interim leader; death toll rises to 30

Disagreement has emerged among “Gen Z” campaigners over who should lead an interim administration, as Nepal faces a political crisis following the fall of the K.P. Sharma Oli government, triggered by a youth-led protest against corruption.

Gen Z campaigners, who have been holding discussions on the digital platform Discord, remain divided, according to Indian media reports.

Some are backing former Chief Justice Sushila Karki, while others support Balendra Shah, the current Mayor of Kathmandu.

Youth protest groups have now gathered in front of the Army headquarters in Kathmandu after failing to reach a consensus.

The Nepal Army, which has been tasked with negotiating with Gen Z campaigners, has asked them to first agree among themselves before talks can move forward.

Meanwhile, the total number of casualties from the Gen Z-led protests in Nepal has reached 30.

The Ministry of Health and Population said last evening the death toll has climbed to 30, while 1,033 people are currently receiving treatment at various hospitals across the country.

At least 19 people, mostly youth, were killed on Monday, the day Nepal”s Gen Z launched protests in Kathmandu and other parts of the country demanding an end to corruption and misgovernance.

Prime Minister Oli resigned in the face of massive protests for a second day, even as the ban on social media was lifted late on Monday night.
