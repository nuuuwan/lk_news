National Chamber hosts networking event with newly appointed SL diplomats

The National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka on Tuesday hosted newly appointed Sri Lankan diplomats for a networking session with business leaders.

The event was held in collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment, and Tourism, and was an exclusive networking session for the local corporate and business community.

The session was graced by eight newly appointed Sri Lankan Ambassadors and High Commissioners designated to strategic diplomatic postings in Indonesia, Brazil, the Maldives, Türkiye, Nepal, South Korea, Kenya (Nairobi), and Oman, as well as five Consul Generals designated to Guangzhou, Shanghai, Milan, Los Angeles, and Jeddah.

The event served as a dynamic platform for Sri Lankan businesses to engage directly with the diplomats, explore new opportunities for export market access, discuss investment and trade prospects, and foster stronger bilateral economic ties, the National Chamber said.

“Participants appreciated the opportunity to exchange insights on international market dynamics and gain first-hand perspectives on how Sri Lanka can strengthen its global trade footprint through strategic diplomatic and business collaboration,” it said in a statement.
