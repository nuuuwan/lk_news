Nation Lanka Finance scraps private placement plans

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Nation Lanka Finance said it would not proceed with the planned private placement of shares, which would have helped it meet working capital requirements.

The company had received regulator approval for the private placement of 30 billion ordinary shares at 10 cents a share.

“NLF PLC wishes to now inform that the Company would not pursue with the said Private Placement of Shares,” the finance company said in a stock exchange filing.

The Colombo Stock Exchange had notified it that the application made by the company for listing of additional shares is deemed cancelled due to the company’s delay in finalizing the same, Nation Lanka Finance said.

In July, Sri Lanka’s central bank appointed an administrator to run the Nation Lanka Finance Plc, using its new powers to resolved troubled banks and finance companies, after the firm failed to meet capital requirements and regulations. (Colombo/Sep29/2025)
