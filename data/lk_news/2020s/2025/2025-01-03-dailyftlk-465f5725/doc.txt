Advocata Institute to hold #ResetNow Conference on 22-23 January

Independent policy think-tank, the Advocata Institute has announced the upcoming conference, “Ignite Growth: Pathways to Sustainable Economic Growth” scheduled for 22 and 23 January.

This #ResetNow Conference will delve into innovative approaches to accelerate productivity and drive economic growth, setting the stage for a brighter and a sustainable future for Sri Lanka.

This landmark event will spotlight the transformative potential of productivity efficiency through evolving business models, lean management practices, and operational improvements. It will also serve as a platform to mainstream productivity-enhancing ideas across political parties, the media, and the general public.

Advocata said, “Sri Lanka stands at a pivotal moment, transitioning from crisis to growth. Early signs of stabilisation offer a promising outlook for economic recovery, but significant challenges remain. Economic growth is not just an aspiration; it is the only viable path to overcoming the current crisis and ensuring sustainable debt management.

To achieve this, the country must focus on productivity enhancement and sustainable reforms to establish long-term prosperity. Stabilising public finances through expenditure reduction, revenue generation, and structural reforms is vital to building a resilient market system. These reforms, though challenging, must be carefully managed to mitigate their impact on the most vulnerable citizens.”

Tickets for Ignite Growth will be available soon through dedicated portals.
