# Sri Lanka opposition to bring no-confidence motion against speaker

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s opposition will bring a no-confidence motion against Parliament speaker Jagath Wickramaratne, MP Ajith Perera said.

“The opposition has decided to table a no-confidence motion against the speaker at the right time,” Perera told parliament.

“If the speaker himself breaks standing orders, if the speaker himself violates standing order 76 1, if the speaker takes upon himself a power he does not possess, if the speaker prevents parliamentarians, this country’s public representatives, from speaking – denying them their supreme rights, there is no greater crime, deputy speaker.”

“The speaker is not suitable for this chair; he does not have the discipline, he does not have impartiality.”

Jagath Wickramaratne is the National Peoples Power governments second speaker.

He replaced Ashoka Ranwala who resigned after a month in the post after his claim to have a PhD was questioned.(Colombo/Sep25/2025)
