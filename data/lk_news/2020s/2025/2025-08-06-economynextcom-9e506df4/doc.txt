Businesses allegedly run by tourists owned by Sri Lankans: Police

ECONOMYNEXT – Some businesses which are alleged to be run by foreigners, particularly Israelis, are actually owned by Sri Lankans when investigations are made, Assistant Superintendent of Police and Acting Director of Tourist Police Division Prabath Widanamagama said.

Opposition politicians have pointed out that foreigners on tourist visas run businesses illegally in tourist hotspots such as Arugam Bay and Weligama.

“Yes, we have received reports, we took legal action against some such places, but when we go there to investigate it is Sri Lankans who show up as owners.”

“It is everyone’s responsibility; people engaged in the tourist trade must decide whether they are going to be bought over for money to allow other people to operate under their names.”

“You can’t come to Sri Lanka and do business on a tourist visa, that’s illegal, we take action against that.”

Legal action was taken against two British nationals recently, he said.

There are 241 places supplying services to tourists in the Arugam Bay area he said.

Arugam Bay has hit the headlines recently due to having a Shabad house and markings and menus in Hebrew in the area where there is a concentration of Israeli tourists.

There is anger against Israel over its starvation of Gaza residents and shooting them after luring them to aid points, amidst what is now recognised as an ongoing genocide.
