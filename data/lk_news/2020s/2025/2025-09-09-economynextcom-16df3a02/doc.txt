Sri Lanka media personnel went to Israel on private tour, no gov involvement: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – A group of Sri Lankan media personnel currently visiting Israel on a tour sponsored by the Israeli government are traveling privately, with no involvement from the Sri Lankan government, Media Minister Nalinda Jayatissa said.

“They are on a private tour, there is no government involvement,” Jayatissa told reporters who questioned him about allowing journalists to go to Israel when it is accused of killing over 270 journalists.

“Anyone is free to go to Israel, there is no ban on visiting,” he said adding, “We can’t obstruct this.”

“You can ask your colleagues what they think about it when they return. They have applied for leave and gone,” Jayatissa said, dodging questions on what the government’s stance on the matter was.

The Israeli Embassy in India had coordinated the visit, he said.

The group of 16 media personnel include 2 from the state-owned TV channel Rupavahini.

Since October 7, 2023, Israel has killed over 270 journalists according to Reporters Without Borders and Al Jazeera estimates. (Colombo/Sep9/2025)
