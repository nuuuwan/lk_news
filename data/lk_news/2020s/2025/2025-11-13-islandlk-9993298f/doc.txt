SL signals readiness to host ‘new class of global luxury’

Colombo’s skyline has a new jewel — the Sapphire Residences, where apartments start at USD 1.2 million and rise to nearly USD 3 million for the larger units. Unveiled to the media at an exclusive walk-through recently, this ultra-luxury oceanfront development is redefining premium living and signaling growing investor confidence in Sri Lanka’s high-end real estate market.

Developed by WelcomHotels Lanka (Private) Limited, a subsidiary of ITC Hotels Limited India, the project marks ITC’s first mixed-use development outside its home country. For ITC — a century-old conglomerate with a formidable reputation for excellence and sustainability — the Colombo project represents both a milestone and a message: Sri Lanka is ready to host a new class of global luxury.

“This is a landmark development and a statement of confidence in Sri Lanka’s future, said Subi George, Managing Director of WelcomHotels Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. “By merging world-class design with ITC Group’s philosophy of Responsible Luxury, we are proud to introduce a new benchmark for sustainable, ultra-luxury living in South Asia.”

The development comprises 132 residences, aptly called Sky Mansions, each designed to offer panoramic views of the ocean, Beira Lake and the Colombo cityscape. The smallest two-bedroom units span a generous 3,000 square feet, while the largest — the master penthouse — covers a breathtaking 20,000 square feet.

“All 132 apartments offer scenic water views, and 131 of them look directly over the Indian Ocean, noted Neluka De Alwis, Chief Sales and Marketing Director of Sri Lanka Sotheby’s International Realty, the exclusive sales and marketing partner for Sapphire Residences. “This is ultra-luxury vertical living at its best. In real estate, location is everything — and here, we’re right on the Galle Face oceanfront, Colombo’s gold phase.”

She added that the development’s clientele primarily comprises ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNIs) — both Sri Lankans based locally and overseas, as well as expatriates and foreign investors. “Been fortunate to attract discerning buyers who are end-users. These are not speculative investors — they’re people who plan to live here and make Sapphire their home, she said.

The Sapphire Residences is the result of collaboration among some of the world’s most respected names in architecture and design. Gensler (USA) served as the principal architect in partnership with Surath Wickramasinghe Associates, one of Sri Lanka’s leading architectural firms. The interiors were created by YOO Inspired by Philippe Starck (UK), while Thornton Tomasetti (USA) handled structural engineering and Burega Farnell (Singapore) crafted the landscape.

The striking triangular design and north-south orientation maximise light, airflow, and panoramic views, setting a new aesthetic standard for Colombo’s urban skyline. The project also embodies ITC’s sustainability philosophy, having achieved LEED Platinum certification, the globally recognised benchmark for environmentally responsible construction.

“This development is more than just glass and steel — it’s a reflection of optimism and belief in Sri Lanka’s potential, De Alwis added. “Projects like this show that Colombo is ready to compete on the global stage, offering world-class living infused with Sri Lankan warmth and charm.”
