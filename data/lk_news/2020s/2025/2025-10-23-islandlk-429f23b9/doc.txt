SL’s economic growth expected to remain healthy and sustainable

Sri Lanka is on course to meet its inflation and financial stability targets by next year, with economic growth projected to remain healthy and sustainable, Central Bank Governor Dr Nandalal Weerasinghe said.

“Central Bank’s inflation target of 5 percent is expected to be achieved in the coming year and financial stability has significantly improved compared to the crisis years of 2022 and 2023, the Governor said at a financial stability review meeting for 2025 held yesterday at the Central Bank head office.

“In terms of economic recovery, economy is continuously growing around 5 per cent, the Governor said.

“I think that is a healthy economic growth rate after the crisis occurred in 2022 and 2023, Dr. Weerasinghe added.

Addressing concerns raised in political circles about rising inflation and unsustainable conditions, the Governor clarified the distinction between short-term inflation fluctuations and long-term targets.

Dr. Weerasinghe revealed that Sri Lanka is likely to surpass key fiscal targets, including the primary surplus and revenue goals, which will positively impact debt sustainability.

He further, explained that lower-than-expected fiscal deficits mean reduced borrowing needs, leading to improved debt dynamics and a more favorable outlook for long-term economic stability.

In the current global context, it is essential that the Government and private sector organizations such as the CNCI work together to strengthen local industries – PM
