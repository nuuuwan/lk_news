Urban regeneration housing projects to resume with over Rs. 7 b  investment

The Cabinet of Ministers has approved the resumption of two long-delayed housing developments in Colombage Mawatha Housing Project and the Torrington Mawatha Housing Project under the Urban Regeneration Project with an investment of Rs. 7.48 billion.

The 11-storey housing complex situated on Colombage Mawatha, Narahenpita is part of the Government’s long-term Urban Regeneration Project. The projects, which had been halted for several years, were first cleared for reactivation at the Cabinet meeting on 30 December 2024.

Speaking at the weekly post-Cabinet yesterday, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said Colombage Mawatha project will see 615 housing units, while Torrington Mawatha will add 115 units, bringing the total to 730 new homes.

He said the Urban Development, Construction and Housing Ministry has noted that the combined estimated cost is Rs. 7.48 billion, with a construction period of two and a half years. “Funding will be allocated across the 2026–2028 Budget cycles to complete the developments,” he added.

Dr. Jayatissa said the move is part of the Government’s ongoing efforts to accelerate urban housing delivery and improve living conditions for low- and middle-income communities in Colombo, while also reviving stalled infrastructure projects that have faced financial and operational setbacks.
