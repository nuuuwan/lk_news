Pre-Trial Hearing Scheduled for Namal Rajapaksa’s ‘Krrish’ Case

The Colombo High Court has scheduled a pre-trial hearing for the case filed by the Attorney General against SLPP MP Namal Rajapaksa over the controversial ‘Krrish’ project on December 18.

MP Rajapaksa appeared in court today (26) as the case was called.

The court also directed that the original case report be obtained from the Fort Magistrate’s Court.

The Attorney General alleges that MP Rajapaksa committed an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, claiming he received Rs. 70 million from the Indian company ‘Krrish’ under the pretext of promoting rugby in Sri Lanka.
