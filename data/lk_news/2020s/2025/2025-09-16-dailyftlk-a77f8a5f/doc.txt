First-ever EFC National Best Employer Awards up for grabs

At a time when Sri Lanka is rediscovering its strength and optimism, the Employers’ Federation of Ceylon (EFC) has announced the launch of the inaugural EFC National Best Employer Awards 2025. This landmark initiative comes at a pivotal moment in the nation’s journey, as organisations and communities embrace resilience, innovation, and purpose.

The awards represent a national movement to honour organisations that redefine what it means to be truly great employers—entities that go beyond profit to create workplaces where people thrive, communities are uplifted, and values are lived with purpose. The programme will recognise those who champion holistic wellbeing while driving sustainable business practices and meaningful social impact.

As the first of its kind in Sri Lanka, the EFC National Best Employer Awards 2025 will establish a credible and aspirational benchmark for organisational excellence. It will spotlight organisations that lead with both heart and vision—fostering inclusive, ethical, and progressive workplaces that contribute to national development and societal wellbeing.

This initiative is powered by AIA Insurance as Platinum Partner. As one of Sri Lanka’s leading life insurers, AIA’s involvement reflects its mission to help people live healthier, longer, and better lives. Through this partnership, AIA reaffirms its commitment to holistic wellbeing by supporting healthier, happier workplaces and communities.

The program is further strengthened by the support of: EY – Assurance Partner, Wijeya Newspapers – Print Media Partner, Galle Face Hotel – Hospitality Partner, FCB KL.LK – Creative Partner, and MTV – Electronic Media Partner.

Each partner plays a vital role in reinforcing EFC’s vision of excellence.

All legally registered organisations in Sri Lanka with at least three years of operations are invited to apply. This is a unique opportunity to gain national recognition, benchmark performance against industry leaders both locally and globally, and showcase organisational innovation and commitment.

Excellence will be assessed across four transformative pillars: ‘Strategic HR Excellence’, ‘Leadership and Culture’, ‘National and Socio-Economic Contribution’, and ‘Ethics and Compliance and Digital Transformation’.

Together, these pillars provide a holistic view of organisational health—where strong leadership, meaningful engagement, and responsible practices converge to create thriving environments for employees and communities alike.

To ensure transparency and professionalism, the evaluation process will be overseen by an Independent Technical Awards Committee, guided by the values of integrity, inclusivity, and impact.

Marking 96 years of championing sustainable employment, the EFC now calls upon every future-ready organisation in Sri Lanka to step forward and be recognised for their vision and commitment.

Applications are open until 10 October. Registration is free of charge.
