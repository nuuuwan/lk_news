Card transaction facilities introduced to the judicial system

As an initial step towards automating the payments made by the general public to the judicial system, card payment facilities have been introduced to the judiciary under the patronage of Chief Justice Preethi Padman Surasena this afternoon (10), at the premises of the Supreme Court.

Through the payment system, in future, the public will be facilitated to make all types of payments—including court fines, case fees, stamp duties, and certified copy fees—ranging from Magistrate’s Courts up to the Supreme Court, via card payments and online payment systems, the Ministry of Justice said in a statement.

Accordingly, from today, lawyers and the general public will have the convenience of making payments related to the Supreme Court proceedings using DEBIT and CREDIT cards.

Members of the Judicial Service Commission, the President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, Attorney-at-Law Rajeev Amarasuriya, as well as the Registrar and Deputy Registrars of the Supreme Court, also participated in the event.

The fast-track program to digitize Sri Lanka’s judicial system, implemented under the guidance of Chief Justice Preethi Padman Surasena, is scheduled to be officially launched on September 12, 2025, at the auditorium of the Hulftsdorp Judicial Officers’ Training Institute in Colombo, with the participation of the Minister of Justice, Attorney-at-Law Harshana Nanayakkara.
