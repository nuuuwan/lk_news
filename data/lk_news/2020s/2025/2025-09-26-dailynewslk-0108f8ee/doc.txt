Kesara shines at Indian  National Car Racing C’ship

Sri Lanka’s young motor racing sensation, Kesara Godage, has stormed to the top of the points standings at the FMSCI Car Racing Championship 2025 in Chennai, India. Competing in a Honda in the ‘Super Stock’ category at the Madras International Circuit, the 19-year-old driver secured third place in the opening race of the second round before finishing runner-up in both the second and third races, after successfully concluding round one.

With these results, Kesara now leads the overall championship table after two rounds. The series features four rounds of three races each, with the third round scheduled for mid-next month. All eyes will be on Kesara as he looks to extend his dominance on Indian soil.

In the first round, he showcased his skill by winning the first and third races while taking second place in the other.

Last year, Kesara made history by sweeping all three races in the MRF Saloons category of the Indian National Car Racing Championship – a feat hailed as the greatest achievement by a Sri Lankan racing driver in India.
