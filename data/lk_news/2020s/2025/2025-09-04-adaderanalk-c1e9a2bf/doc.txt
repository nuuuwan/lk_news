Cabinet approves new circular for state school admissions

The Cabinet of Ministers has granted approval to the proposal to issue a new circular regarding the admission of students from Grade 2 to Grade 11, excluding Grades 5 and 6, in government schools.

The decision has been taken considering the need to implement the proposed new education reforms and to maintain the number of students per classroom within the approved limits.

Therefore, it has been recognized that an appropriate mechanism should be introduced to allow student admissions to intermediate grades—excluding Grades 5 and 6—while safeguarding every child’s right to education in the country, Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa stated.

Taking these factors into consideration, plans are in place to issue a new circular that provides guidelines for allowing students who genuinely need to transfer from one school to another for various reasons to apply for admission, giving priority to such students, the Cabinet Spokesman added.

Accordingly, based on the recommendations submitted by the subcommittee appointed by the Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Education, Higher Education, and Vocational Education, the guidelines provided in previous circulars regarding admissions from Grade 2 to Grade 11—excluding Grades 5 and 6—will be revoked.

The Cabinet has approved the proposal presented by the Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, in her capacity as the Minister of Education, Higher Education, and Vocational Education, to issue the new circular with the updated guidelines.
