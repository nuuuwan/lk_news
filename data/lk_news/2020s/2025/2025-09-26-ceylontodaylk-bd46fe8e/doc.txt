Sri Lanka Launches ‘Mission Olympics 2028’

Under the guidance of the Minister of Sports Sunil Kumara Gamage, Sri Lanka officially launched the ‘Mission Olympics 2028 – Journey to the Rings’ initiative yesterday (25) at the Duncan White Auditorium.

The programme, implemented under the full supervision of the Department of Sports Development, aims to identify and support athletes with the potential to compete at the Olympic Games, Asian Games, Asian Para Games, and Commonwealth Games.

The initiative focuses on providing financial and logistical support to athletes who have already demonstrated exceptional talent on the international stage, as well as those with the potential to reach Olympic standards. The ultimate goal is to guide these athletes toward podium finishes at global events.

Speaking at the event, Minister Sunil Kumara Gamage emphasised that all funds allocated for the programme are derived from public tax revenue. He stressed that it is the responsibility of athletes to honour this support through commitment and excellence. “This is not private money — it belongs to the people. It must be managed transparently and returned to the public in the form of national pride,” he said.

The Government has approved a monthly allowance scheme for athletes and coaches under four performance categories, as part of its national budget. The breakdown is as follows:

– Category 1: Rs. 150,000 for athletes, Rs. 100,000 for coaches

– Category 2: Rs. 100,000 for athletes, Rs. 65,000 for coaches

– Category 3: Rs. 75,000 for athletes, Rs. 50,000 for coaches

– Category 4: Rs. 50,000 for athletes, Rs. 30,000 for coaches

– Additionally, all athletes will receive a Rs. 60,000 nutrition allowance

Deputy Minister of Sports, Sugath Thilakaratne also addressed the gathering, reiterating that athletes must be accountable for the public funds they receive and remain dedicated to their training and performance. He expressed confidence that Sri Lanka’s athletes will rise to the challenge and bring international glory to the nation.

The athlete pool will be reviewed and updated every six months, with performance evaluations and consultations with coaches to identify hidden talent. Those who show consistent progress will remain in the programme.

Thilakaratne also emphasised the importance of clean sport, stating that all athletes must undergo anti-doping tests. He warned that any confirmed use of banned substances would tarnish the country’s reputation on the global stage.

The Ministry of Sports pledged continued investment in international exposure, technical equipment, and knowledge-sharing to uplift Sri Lankan sports.

The event was also attended by Deputy Minister Eranga Gunasekara, National Selection Committee Chairperson Shriyani Kulawansa, National Sports Council Chairman Priyantha Ekanayake, National Olympic Committee President Suresh Subramaniam, and Director of Sports I.P. Wijerathna, along with a large number of athletes and coaches.
