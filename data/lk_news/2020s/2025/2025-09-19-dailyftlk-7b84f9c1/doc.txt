The Parliament Secretariat yesterday said Women Parliamentarians’ Caucus has held discussions with representatives of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD) and the Law and Society Trust (LST) on potential areas of support and ways to encourage greater political participation by young women.

The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya and Caucus Chairperson and Women and Child Affairs Minister Saroja Savitri Paulraj and focused on gender-sensitive governance and intergenerational dialogue.

WFD representatives proposed support for introducing gender-sensitive law-making and gender-responsive budgeting, strengthening the Caucus’s role in increasing women’s labour force participation, and providing research and policy input to make Parliament more gender-sensitive.

Members of the Caucus emphasised the importance of extending research beyond Parliament to grassroots activism, noting that mobilisation and women’s participation at the community level are essential for broader change. They also discussed the challenges faced by women Parliamentarians and highlighted the need for support mechanisms, including counselling.

The Caucus further engaged in discussions on intergenerational dialogue as a way to encourage young women to enter politics. Representatives from the Law and Society Trust invited Caucus members to a program on this theme scheduled for 16 to 19 September.
