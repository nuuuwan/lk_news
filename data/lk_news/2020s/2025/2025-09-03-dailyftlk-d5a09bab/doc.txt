SLPP seeks Maha Sangha’s support over harassment of war heroes

The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has written to the Chief Prelate of the Asgiriya Chapter of the Siam Nikaya, the Most Ven. Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Thero, raising concerns about what it describes as the “harassment” of war heroes.

The letter, signed by SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam, stresses that the party considers it a historic responsibility to defend those who fought to protect the freedom of the country.

“History has entrusted the SLPP with the responsibility of standing up for the war heroes who sacrificed their lives for the freedom of the motherland. This is a responsibility that the party cannot abandon,” the letter states.

Reaffirming the SLPP’s stance, Kariyawasam wrote that as both a political party and a social movement shaped by the will of the people, the SLPP remains committed to safeguarding the dignity of war heroes.

The party has also sought the blessings and support of the Maha Sangha, particularly the Chief Prelates and the wider Buddhist clergy, in fulfilling this duty.
