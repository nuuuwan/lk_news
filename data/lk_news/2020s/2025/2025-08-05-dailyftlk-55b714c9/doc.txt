This August, tea export company Empire Teas will celebrate 25 years by inviting business partners from across the world for a heartfelt celebration in Sri Lanka. From 7-9 August, guests will enjoy a curated tea journey from behind-the-scenes tours to lush plantations and a grand Gala Dinner to honour the friendships that have powered the company’s success.

From modest beginnings to becoming one of Sri Lanka’s top five tea exporters, Empire Teas now delivers over 14 million kilos of premium Ceylon tea to more than 70 countries annually. Behind this growth is a story of vision and heart, led by the founder, a third-generation tea master, Lushantha de Silva, and a team dedicated to doing things the right way, always. “This isn’t just our celebration,” says Lushantha. “It’s a thank you to our business partners who believed in us, walked with us, and helped us grow.”

Empire’s footprint extends far beyond Sri Lanka, with operations in Kenya and teams across China, Spain, and the Netherlands. Its signature brands, Hyson, Thurson, Akina, and Tea Avenue, carry the story of Ceylon tea to the world, while hundreds of private-label partners trust Empire to uphold their brand’s promise. What makes Empire truly special, though, is not just the tea. It’s the trust it’s built, the values it’s stayed true to, and the future it’s shaping. “We may have started small,” reflects Lushantha, “but we’ve grown with soul. And this is just the beginning.” Thus, Empire continues to grow with soul, anchored in values, inspired by legacy, and driven by a bold vision for the future.
