Sri Lanka completes first Japan funded project after debt restructure

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has completed the construction of a key transmission line funded by Japan which was delayed due the island’s debt default.

Habarana-Veyangoda Transmission like funded with a yen loan of around 65 million Us dollars, was opened at a ceremony attended by Japan’s Ambassador Akio Isomata.

“This project is a significant milestone as it is the first yen-loan project which has been completed and handed over to Sri Lanka since the disbursement of eleven suspended yen-loan projects was resumed in July last year, after the interval of three years…,” the Japanese embassy said in a statement.

The new, large capacity and long-distance transmission, which help Sri Lanka reduce CO2 emissions by cutting down on transmission loss, Ambassador Isomata said.

The project was a vital part of Sri Lanka’s electricity system to ensure stability, reliability, and greater capacity, and it would help prevent the power failures faced in the recent past, Kumara Jayakody, the Minister of Energy had said. (Colombo/Sept04/2025)
