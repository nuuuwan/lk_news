Indian External Affairs Minister’s tourism diplomacy: Lessons for Sri Lanka

Indian External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar’s recent address at the FAITH Tourism Conclave in India was more than a promotion of travel and hospitality – it was a masterclass in soft power, national resilience, and strategic messaging.

While his speech centred on India’s tourism revival, the underlying themes: diaspora engagement, cultural pride, and navigating global turbulence hold profound relevance for Sri Lanka as it seeks to rebuild its own tourism sector amid economic and geopolitical challenges.

In this context. The Island Financial Review spoke to a veteran in the Sri Lanka tourism sector to inquire how he perceived the high-calibre Indian minister’s views on tourism and their relevance to Sri Lanka Tourism. The following are some excerpts from the interview.

“Jaishankar framed tourism not merely as an economic activity but as a tool for shaping India’s global identity. His emphasis on UNESCO heritage sites from the Hoysala temples to Gujarat’s Statue of Unity mirrors Sri Lanka’s own treasures: Sigiriya, Galle Fort, and Kandy’s cultural triangle. Yet, India’s systematic branding of intangible heritage – yoga, Kumbh Mela, even Bollywood nostalgia offers a blueprint. Sri Lanka, too, could amplify its festivals like Esala Perahera, Thai Pongal and crafts like mask-making, handlooms as part of a curated ‘living heritage’ experience.”

“Crucially, Jaishankar highlighted the diaspora’s role in tourism, urging overseas Indians to ‘bring friends’ home. Sri Lanka’s diaspora, which is also significant and influential, could be leveraged similarly. Imagine targeted campaigns inviting Sri Lankans abroad to explore homestays in Jaffna or surf camps in Arugam Bay – blending emotional homecoming with sustainable tourism.”

“He noted that India’s tourism boom , stems from infrastructure leaps: doubled airports, revamped railways, and initiatives like affordable regional flights and pilgrimage circuits. Sri Lanka’s post-crisis recovery demands parallel strides – not just in highways and hotels but in decentralising tourism. Why not develop Trincomalee’s beaches or Mannar’s bird sanctuaries as alternatives to Colombo and the South?”

“The Indian External Affairs Minister’s praise for homestays and eco-tourism resonates deeply. Sri Lanka’s community-based tourism – whether in Kandy’s villages or the Knuckles range – could thrive with state support, blending livelihoods with conservation. Likewise, India’s MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, Exhibitions) push is instructive. Colombo’s conference tourism potential could be enhanced with newly added infrastructure like City of Dreams – Cinnamon Life, positioning the city as a hub for South Asian business dialogues.”

“Jaishankar’s acceptance of global volatility – from pandemic aftershocks to trade wars was striking. His solution: self-reliance, not as isolation but as resilience. For Sri Lanka, this echoes the need to diversify tourism markets beyond European arrivals and boost domestic travel, as India has done.”

“Equally telling was his diplomatic choreography – hosting G20 events across India, from Kashmir to Kerala, and welcoming leaders like Macron in Jaipur. Sri Lanka, with its compact diversity, could adopt this ‘whole nation’ diplomacy. Imagine showcasing Trinco’s port to Indian investors or Jaffna’s revival to Tamil diaspora leaders – turning tourism into strategic storytelling.”

“Jaishankar’s speech was a reminder that tourism is more than revenue – it’s identity, unity, and geopolitical leverage. Sri Lanka, at a crossroads, must heed these lessons. As the Indian minister rightly said, ‘Tourism connects the world to a nation, and the nation to itself.’ For Sri Lanka, that connection could be the key to revival,” he said.

In conclusion, the Sri Lankan tourism veteran listed out key takeaways from Jaishankar’s speech:

1. Brand the intangible: Celebrate culture, food, crafts, and local festivals.

2. Engage the diaspora: Make them ambassadors for ‘come home, bring friends’ campaigns.

3. Decentralise growth: Invest in rural tourism, homestays, and eco-adventures.

4. Diplomatic storytelling: Use tourism to reframe Sri Lanka’s global narrative – resilient, diverse, open.
