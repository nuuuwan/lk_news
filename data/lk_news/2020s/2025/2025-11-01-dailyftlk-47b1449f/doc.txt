India to support training of teachers under new education reforms: PM

Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya who also serves as the Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education Minister, announced this week that India has pledged to assist Sri Lanka in strengthening its education system by providing teacher training and creating opportunities for innovative educators.

Speaking at the opening ceremony of a multi-ethnic, trilingual school in Polonnaruwa constructed with assistance from the Government of India, the Prime Minister said the initiative reflects a deepening of educational cooperation between the two countries.

She noted that India’s support will focus on enhancing teacher capacity and promoting creative, learner-centred teaching practices aligned with Sri Lanka’s education transformation program.

“This collaboration will help us build a stronger, more inclusive education system that prepares students for the future,” Dr. Amarasuriya said, emphasising that teacher training and innovation are central to the Government’s reform agenda.

The new school, designed to promote trilingual education and social cohesion, represents another milestone in Sri Lanka–India educational partnerships aimed at fostering diversity and equitable access to quality education.
