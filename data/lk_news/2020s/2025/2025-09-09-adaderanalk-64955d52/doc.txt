Speaker announces SC verdict on Presidents’ Entitlements (Repeal) Bill

The Speaker of Parliament (Dr.) Jagath Wickramaratne announced today (09) that the Supreme Court has determined that no provision of the Presidents’ Entitlements (Repeal) Bill is inconsistent with any provisions of the Constitution of Sri Lanka.

Accordingly, the Supreme Court held that the bill can be enacted by a simple majority in Parliament, the Speaker said, announcing the court’s determination on the petitions filed against the bill.

Furthermore, the Speaker revealed that the Supreme Court has dismissed the petition filed against this Bill as the petitioner has failed to invoke jurisdiction in accordance with the mandatory provisions of Article 121(1) of the Constitution.

The Supreme Court had previously, on August 25, indicated that it would submit its confidential determination on the constitutionality of the bill—aimed at removing privileges of retired Presidents—to the Speaker of Parliament.

After an extensive hearing, a three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justices Achala Wengappuli, and Sampath Abeykoon issued the order concluding the hearing of petitions filed against the Presidents’ Entitlements (Repeal) Bill.

The Presidents’ Entitlements (Repeal) Bill, which seeks to repeal the Presidents’ Entitlements Act, was presented to Parliament by the Minister of Justice Harshana Nanayakkara on August 7.

On July 31, the Presidents’ Entitlements (Repeal) Bill was gazetted. The bill was drafted to revoke special privileges extended to former Presidents and their widows.

Earlier in July, the Cabinet of Minister also granted approval to the proposal to gazette and present in Parliament the draft bill formulated to amend the Presidents Entitlements Act (No. 4 of 1986).
