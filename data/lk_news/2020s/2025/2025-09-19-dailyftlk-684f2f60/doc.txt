Two design powerhouses, Sri Lanka’s celebrated handloom brand Barefoot, and Dutch luxury interiors brand POLSPOTTEN, are joining forces for the first time in a landmark collaboration set to debut in 2025/2026.

The upcoming collection will blend Barefoot’s mastery of handloom craft and colour with POLSPOTTEN’s bold, contemporary design language, marking the first collaboration between Sri Lanka and POLSPOTTEN while building on Barefoot’s decades-long tradition of working with international partners.

The collaboration is part of the EU–Sri Lanka Matchmaking Program, delivered with the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB), supported by the European Union to Sri Lanka and the Maldives and the Cultural Relations Platform (CRP), with the University of the Arts London (UAL) and the British Council as knowledge partners, and The Institute of Future Creations (TIFC) as program leader.

Inspired by the vibrancy of Sri Lanka’s textile traditions and the playful sophistication of Dutch design, the collection will explore new interpretations of Barefoot’s hand-woven fabrics, transformed into unique homeware and interior pieces. While the final designs remain under wraps, early concepts hint at an exciting fusion of texture, form and colour, reimagining Sri Lankan craftsmanship for a global luxury audience.

POLSPOTTEN Creative Director Shiran Gort said: “This collaboration allows us to explore Barefoot’s exceptional weaving heritage through a fresh lens. We are bringing together two strong design identities, one rooted in bold, contemporary Dutch aesthetics and the other in the deep skill and colour mastery of Sri Lankan handlooms. The potential for creative innovation is incredible.”

For Barefoot, this marks a significant milestone. Barefoot Next Generation Lead Sophia Sansoni said:

“Working with POLSPOTTEN is an opportunity to take Sri Lankan handloom into new creative territory. It is a first for us to collaborate with a Dutch luxury interiors brand, but it builds on our long history of working internationally. We see this as a way to show the world what our artisans can achieve when their skills are paired with daring, world-class design thinking.”

EU/EDB Program Project Lead and TIFC Co-Founder Robert Meeder said: “Barefoot and POLSPOTTEN share a deep respect for craft, colour and storytelling. This is not just about making products, it is about creating design-led cultural exchange and elevating Sri Lankan craftsmanship in markets where it can be appreciated at the highest level.”

Former Dutch Ambassador to Sri Lanka Bonnie Horbach, who championed early discussions between the two brands, emphasised the strategic value of such partnerships. “These are the kinds of projects that connect people, markets, and opportunities. They strengthen bilateral relations while opening doors for trade, skills development, and cultural exchange,” she said. “When a collaboration like this succeeds, its impact extends far beyond the showroom floor.”

With the launch anticipated for 2025/2026, this Barefoot × POLSPOTTEN collection is poised to be more than just a meeting of two brands. It will be a showcase of craftsmanship, creativity and cultural collaboration, with more surprises still to come that promise to put Sri Lanka and the Netherlands firmly on the global design map.
