# SriLankan Airlines’s five-year plan to focus on financial stability

ECONOMYNEXT – SriLankan Airlines’ said its new five-year strategic plan will focus on achieving financial stability, and recovery from recent fleet disruptions, among other matters.

“SriLankan Airlines’ comprehensive five-year strategy is steering the airline towards operational efficiency and recovery from recent fleet disruptions,” the airline said in a statement.

“Moving forward, SriLankan will focus on achieving financial stability through ongoing debt restructuring, fleet expansion, integration of global sustainability practices and adoption of technological innovations to deliver seamless experiences for the passengers.”

The airline said it had optimized fleet management, driven revenue growth, cost rationalisation and restructuring debt in the last year.

“SriLankan Airlines has improved its on-time performance to 74% this year, up from 69% in 2024, driven by agile fleet management despite global engine and spare parts shortages and performance challenges.”

New measures have enabled faster fleet maintenance turnarounds, proactive scheduling, maintenance staggering and precise spare parts stocking, the airline said, while new in-house facilities for calibration, testing and inspections strengthened the airline’s autonomy.

Two aircraft grounded for an extended period due to engine unavailability have now returned to service, with a third set to join operations early next year.

In June, the airline inducted a leased Airbus A330-200 wide-body aircraft, expanding operations and services.

“Over the past year, SriLankan Airlines has streamlined its network through route rationalisation, demand-synchronised schedules and enhanced digital sales platforms, leading to revenue growth.

“Key initiatives include revised timings on Indian routes, particularly Bangalore, Kochi and Hyderabad, to better serve the growing Indian leisure market.

From July 2025, the airline introduced double daily services to Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok, alongside four additional flights to Dubai.

During the first five months of the 2025/26 financial year, the airline said it recorded a 10% increase in passenger revenue, 22% higher passenger numbers and a 10% growth in capacity. (Colombo/Sep24/2025)
