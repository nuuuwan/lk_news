Sri Lanka rice, coconut production up; fish, tea and rubber down in June: CB

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s agricultural production in paddy and coconut picked up in June, the central bank said, while tea, fish and rubber production decreased due to unfavourable weather.

“Paddy production for the 2025 Yala season, based on the sown extent as of end June 2025, is forecasted at 2.19 million metric tons, a 10.8% increase from the previous Yala season,” the central bank’s Agriculture Sector Data Bulletin for June 2025 said.

Paddy production forecasts for 2025 is estimated as 4.8 million metric tons, a 2.3 percent increase from 2024.

Coconut production increased by 18.3 percent year on year in June following a recovery since February.

Meanwhile fish production decreased by 20.6 year on year in June, attributed to a decline in both marine and inland fishing activities.

Tea production decreased by 6.3 percent in June mainly attributed to adverse weather conditions.

Rubber production also saw a year-on-year decline in June, according to highly provisional data from the Rubber Development Department.

“Natural rubber prices in global markets decreased in June 2025 across major exporters like Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia, driven by oversupply, high inventories and trade uncertainties.” (Colombo/Aug14/2025)
