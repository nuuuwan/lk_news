Sri Lanka’s Advocata Institute conference to discuss driving economic growth

ECONOMYNEXT – The Advocata Institute conference ‘Ignite Growth: Pathways to Sustainable Economic Growth’ is set to discuss innovative approaches to accelerate productivity and drive economic growth, the policy think-tank said.

“Sri Lanka stands at a pivotal moment, transitioning from crisis to growth. Early signs of stabilisation offer a promising outlook for economic recovery, but significant challenges remain,” Advocata said.

The #ResetNow Conference scheduled for January 22 and 23 will focus on the transformative potential of productivity efficiency through evolving business models, lean management practices, and operational improvements.

It will also serve as a platform to mainstream productivity-enhancing ideas across political parties, the media, and the general public.

“Economic growth is not just an aspiration; it is the only viable path to overcoming the current crisis and ensuring sustainable debt management.”

To achieve this, Advocata says, the country must focus on productivity enhancement and sustainable reforms to establish long-term prosperity.

“Stabilising public finances through expenditure reduction, revenue generation, and structural reforms is vital to building a resilient market system.”

These reforms must be carefully managed to mitigate their impact on the most vulnerable citizens, it pointed out.
