Uva Highlands Estate achieves all-time record price of Rs. 3,700 per kg for BOP Grade

Uva Highlands Estate uniquely and picturesquely located in the agro-climatic district of Malwatte Valley in the Eastern Highlands of the Uva district is famed for its high-quality teas, especially the exquisite distinctive seasonal flavour.

Grown 3,000 to 5,000 feet up on the eastern slopes of Sri Lankaâ€™s central mountains, teas from the Malwatte Valley region within the Uva district do have a distinct flavour and pungency during the period July-September each year following the extreme dry weather conditions accompanied by the desiccating winds.

This estate is ISO 22000:2018, HACCP and Rainforest Alliance certified.

Uva Highlands Estate is managed by Malwatte Valley Plantations PLC under the stewardship of Group Manager Daminda Wanigasekara.

This line of tea was sold and marketed by Forbes & Walker at the tea auctions held on 4 and 5 August.
