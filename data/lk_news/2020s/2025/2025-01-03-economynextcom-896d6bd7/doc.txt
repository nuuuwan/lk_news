CEAT India team, EDB discuss trade expansion in Sri Lanka

ECONOMYNEXT – A delegation from CEAT, an RPG India company, has met with Sri Lanka’s Export Development Board to discuss expanding CEAT’s presence in the island by diversifying its product portfolio in the rubber sector.

CEAT CEO Arnab Banerjee met EDB chairman Mangala Wijesinghe, recently at the EDB Head Office in Colombo.

“The delegation expressed interest in expanding CEAT’s presence in Sri Lanka by diversifying its product portfolio in the rubber sector,” EDB said.

“Highlighting the company’s recent acquisition, Banerjee elaborated on the CAMSO brand, which is produced in Sri Lanka under RPG’s ownership.”

Banerjee provided an overview of RPG’s operations across various sectors, including agriculture, engineering, and rubber.

Wijesinghe congratulated the team on their expansion initiatives and “underscored additional investment opportunities in Sri Lanka, particularly in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, ICT, agriculture, and logistics”.

Last month France-based Michelin said it was selling two plants in Sri Lanka that made bias tyres and tracks for compact construction equipment to India’s CEAT group.

The meeting was attended by senior officials from CEAT, including Chief Financial Officer Vipul Vaid, Chief Executive of CEAT Specialty Amit Tolani, and Managing Director and CEO of CEAT Sri Lanka Ravi Dadlani. (Colombo/Jan3/2025)
