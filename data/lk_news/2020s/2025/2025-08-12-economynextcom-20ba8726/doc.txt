Sri Lanka to map its rubber plantations using GIS

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will geo-locate rubber lands of small estate owners across the country and create a detailed database using Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, Minister Nalinda Jayatissa said.

This is in response to the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) that must be complied with when exporting rubber and rubber-related products to the bloc, a major market for Sri Lankan rubber, he said.

“Sri Lanka will also have to comply with the new regulations after December 31, 2025 to ensure that rubber supply chains do not contribute to deforestation,” he told reporters.

The project to create a digital system for mapping/registering rubber lands was approved by the cabinet.

The EUDR policy is aimed at minimizing deforestation and forest degradation linked to agricultural commodities imported into the EU, and applies to commodities like wood, rubber, cattle, coffee, cocoa, palm oil, and soybean. (Colombo/Aug12/2025)
