Japan’s revolutionary “W.O.W” technology to debut in Sri Lanka

Japanese innovation with 40 patents targets global health and wellness markets

A revolutionary Japanese technology with the potential to reshape sectors from food preservation to healthcare will make its debut in Sri Lanka. The “W.O.W” (Water Optimising Waves) innovation, developed by Evertron Co., Ltd., was unveiled at the Hilton Colombo by its inventor and CEO Hisao Tanaka, in a landmark gathering of industry leaders and innovators.

“Sri Lanka is the first country where I am fulfilling my dream of sharing this technology internationally,” he said, noting the nation’s historical ties with Japan.

The patented W.O.W system – protected by around 40 global patents – enhances the molecular structure of water, enabling it to maintain cellular freshness in food, flowers and even human cells.

Its applications span SleepTech, HealthTech, FemTech, SportsTech, FoodTech, AgriTech, BeautyTech, PetHealthTech, AgeTech, and EnergyTech. With the global beauty industry projected to reach $ 5.7 trillion by 2027, the technology’s potential in this sector alone is enormous.

Initially designed to revolutionise refrigeration, W.O.W transforms existing refrigerators into freshness-preserving units, keeping produce vibrant for longer periods. Beyond food storage, it has shown potential to improve sleep quality, support athletic recovery, reduce menstrual pain and aid in human cell preservation.

Tanaka, who previously led Cyclone Japan, a company known for pioneering Dyson’s cyclone vacuum cleaners in Japan has spent 40 years pursuing this vision.

Chief Guest and well-known specialist Dr. Amal Harsha De Silva commended the innovation, calling it “the road to a healthy future” for both Japan and Sri Lanka.

He noted that the two nations have a long history of friendship and that Japanese culture stands as a true global example of longevity.

Speaking at the event, Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lanka Former President Kosala Wickramanayake praised the initiative.

“Innovation like this is a great initiative, and a technology of this nature is surely going to prosper in the near future — especially in a world where health is wealth,” he said.

The technology operates through two core principles – Water Micronisation and Water Pearl Chain Structure – generating an electric field that influences water and other substances at a molecular level. Patented in over 30 countries, it represents a leap forward in sustainable innovation.
