Nepal Parliament set on fire after PM quits amid anti-corruption protests

Nepal’s Parliament building has been set on fire, as protesters have broken in and smashed windows

Hundreds of protesters stormed Nepal’s Parliament building in Kathmandu yesterday after days of anti-corruption demonstrations, setting part of the structure ablaze and vandalising its interior, the BBC reported.

Protesters smashed windows, spray-painted anti-Government slogans, and carried paintings and uprooted plants out of the compound on motorbikes. Around a fire lit at the building’s entrance, many waved Nepal’s flag and chanted against corruption. One graffiti message read: “you took the wrong fight.”

The unrest followed the resignation of Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, who stepped down on moral grounds after at least 19 people were killed during the protests, local media reported. Seventeen died in Kathmandu and two in the eastern city of Itahari, according to police. Dozens more were injured in clashes.

Thousands of demonstrators, many identifying as Generation Z, had gathered outside Parliament to oppose a Government ban on platforms including Facebook, X and YouTube, while also calling for an end to political corruption. “Rather than the social media ban, I think everyone’s focus is on corruption,” protester Sabana Budathoki told the BBC. Another demonstrator said the ban was meant to “silence” voices, prompting them to “raise” their voices instead.

Police responded with water cannons, tear gas, batons and rubber bullets after crowds breached restricted zones. Kathmandu Valley Police spokesman Shekhar Khanal confirmed fatalities and said force was used when protesters scaled the Parliament wall. Tear gas also reached a hospital treating the injured, with one official telling AFP it created “a disturbing situation” for doctors.

The Government argued the social media restrictions were necessary to tackle fake news, hate speech and online fraud. Since Friday, users have faced difficulty accessing platforms, though some have turned to VPNs. Two services have since been restored after registering with authorities.

The United Nations Human Rights Office called for a “prompt and transparent investigation” into the deaths and raised concerns over allegations of disproportionate use of force.

A curfew was imposed around Parliament and other parts of Kathmandu. A Nepal Army spokesman confirmed troops were deployed to enforce order.

The BBC reported the protests have become the most violent in Nepal in years, with grievances over corruption and economic stagnation converging with opposition to the Government’s social media clampdown.
