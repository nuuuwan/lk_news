Inspiring Sri Lanka’s children to dream big on World Children’s Day

In celebration of World Children’s Day on 1 October, SriLankan Airlines facilitated the flight experience for a special program for children selected through a creative competition from every province across Sri Lanka.

Through this unique initiative, 250 youngsters aged 12 to 15 were gifted the opportunity to enjoy a nearly two-hour flight aboard a SriLankan Airlines Airbus A330-300, with breath-taking views of Sri Lanka’s stunning landscapes from the sky. For many, it was their first flying experience.

The children were warmly welcomed at Bandaranaike International Airport and taken on a guided tour by SriLankan Airlines’ Ground Handling team and Airport and Aviation Services (AASL), where they experienced the full international travel process, from check-in to boarding, before taking off to the skies with SriLankan Airlines.

The flight, which departed from Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), offered a bird’s-eye view of some of Sri Lanka’s most iconic landmarks, including the coastal belt of Colombo, Galle, Adam’s Peak, Pidurutalagala, Sigiriya, Mullaitivu, Delft Island, Anuradhapura, and Negombo, before returning to the airport. The children’s experience was captured and will be broadcast by Derana TV through a one-hour program on 6 October.

SriLankan Airlines Manager – Corporate Communications Deepal Perera said: “At SriLankan Airlines, we believe that the sky should never be the limit to a child’s dreams. It was a privilege to partner with Derana and Signal on this extraordinary initiative, giving children from every corner of our island the chance to experience the wonder of flight on International Children’s Day. For many, it was their very first time in the air. We are glad to have been part of a journey that may inspire future aviators, explorers, and leaders of tomorrow.”
