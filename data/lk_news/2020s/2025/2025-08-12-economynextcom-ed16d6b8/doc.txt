Sri Lanka discussing tax, local market access for Sinopec refinery: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is discussing tax and local market access for a refinery to be built by China’s Sinopec, Deputy Economic Development Minister Anil Jayantha said.

“..[W]hen it comes to tax-related issues and other things, there is a little delay,” Minister Jayantha told an investment forum in Singapore organized by the Colombo Stock Exchange and Securities and Exchange Commission.

“As of now, what I can say, it is in the final stage. There are a few things yet to be agreed upon, but almost it is done.”

Also being discussed is the refinery’s access to local markets. The refinery was supposed to be an export-oriented project approved by the Board of Investment.

“We are talking about market accessibility and the demand for energy,” Minister Jayantha explained.

“As of now, in Sri Lanka, the daily requirement is around 120,000, 140,000 balance per day. This investment has a huge capacity.

“The investment capacity has been doubled. So since it comes through BOI agreements, there are limitations about the accessibility to local markets. We are discussing these things.”

The project may be finalized by the end of the year, he said.

Sinopec also has a fuel distribution unit in Sri Lanka with a network of pumping stations.

It is not clear what the problem with local market access is if Sinopec uses the refinery fuel, or if the refinery responds to competitive tenders by any other distributors. (Colombo/Aug12/2025)
