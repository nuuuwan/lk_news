Elevare – ‘a platform that celebrates the hero within every journey’

Derived from the Latin word “Elevare” – meaning “to elevate” – the name itself reflects our mission: To create a platform that celebrates the hero within every journey.

Elevare is a quarterly luxury business and lifestyle magazine, uniquely positioned to connect Sri Lanka’s leading entrepreneurs, both at home and abroad, with emerging ventures and creative voices. It delves into the rich intersections of enterprise & human experience, diplomacy & culture, craft & commerce, innovation & identity. The magazine seeks to elevate stories that matter; stories of resilience, courage, and power.

Elevare is a publication of Business Media International chaired by Ms. Manori Hettiarachchi and director Akash Karunathilake.

Led by Editor-in-Chief Nayomi Apsara, at Elevare, “we believe that business transcends numbers; it’s a living expression of people, stories, memory, and meaning. Entrepreneurship, to us, is deeply personal and profoundly transformative. That’s why our pages carve out space for art, heritage and cultural exchange alongside business features and inspiring profiles”.

“Our readership is comprised of Business leaders, entrepreneurs, diplomats, cultural figures, investors, venture capitalists, luxury lifestyle consumers, artists, designers & innovators; individuals whose influence shapes industries and drives meaningful change within society”.
