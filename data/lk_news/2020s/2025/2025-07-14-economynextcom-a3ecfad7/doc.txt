Sri Lanka restructures debt from Saudi Arabia

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka signed bilateral amendatory loan agreements with Saudi Fund for Development (SFD) to restructure around 517 million Saudi Arabia Riyal (SAR) under the external debt restructuring process of the island nation, the Finance Ministry said.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has played a pivotal role by providing continuous loan disbursements, even after Sri Lanka declared a debt standstill decision due to the economically challenging situation the Ministry said.

“This assistance enabled (us) to achieve the significant progress of the development projects without any hindrances of implementation. Moreover, the loans extended by (the) Saudi Fund for Development were provided on concessionary terms by offering the relief to the country’s overall debt burden,” it said in a statement.

The agreements were signed on Monday and a total restructured amount was Saudi Riyal (SAR) 516,95 million.

Treasury Secretary Harshana Suriyapperuma  signed the agreements on behalf of Sri Lanka while Sultan Abdulrahaman A Almarshad, the Chief Executive Officer of the SFD signed the agreements for the SFD.

“The conclusion of the loan restructuring agreements will certainly pave the way to developing further the deep and long standing bilateral relationships between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Government of Sri Lanka,” the Finance Ministry said. (Colombo/July 14/2025)
