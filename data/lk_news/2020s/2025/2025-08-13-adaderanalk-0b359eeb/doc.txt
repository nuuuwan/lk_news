Floods affect over 1.7 million people in India’s Bihar

Over 1.7 million people were affected by the ongoing flooding in India’s eastern state of Bihar, officials said Tuesday.

The floods have hit the state’s 10 districts, including the capital city of Patna.

According to officials, the heavy rains have pushed up the water level of rivers in the state, resulting in the severe waterlogging of low-lying areas.
