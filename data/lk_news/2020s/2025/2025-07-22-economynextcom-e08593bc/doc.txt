Preethi Padman Surasena nominated as Sri Lanka chief justice

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s President Anura Disanayake has submitted the name of Preethi Padman Surasena for chief justice to the Constitutional Council, minister Nalinda Jayatissa said.

“Yes, the president has submitted Preethi Padman Surasena’s name to the constitutional council as chief justice,” Jayatissa said in response to a journalist’s question.

Jayatissa said Surasena was a senior judge of the Supreme Court and someone who had worked in the justice system a long time, and that was why the president submitted his name, when asked about overlooking seniority.

Justice Surasena chaired a panel appointed by parliament to investigate allegations against Inspector General of Police Deshabandu Tennakoon. (Colombo/Jul22/2025)
