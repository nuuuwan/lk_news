Two new operators for branded clothing shops at BIA

The Cabinet of Ministers approved awarding contracts to three new operators for branded clothing shops in the departure and transit areas of the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake for three to four years.

The approved operators are Odel PLC and Insomn Ltd., chosen based on the recommendations of the Standing Procurement Committee appointed by the Cabinet of Ministers.

Following an international competitive bidding process, the selection process attracted bids from three companies, with two successful bidders securing the opportunity to operate branded men’s and women’s outlets for a duration of three to four years.

The Cabinet of Ministers also approved the recall of bids for additional shops, ensuring that future opportunities align with the strategic development goals of the airport’s commercial offerings.
