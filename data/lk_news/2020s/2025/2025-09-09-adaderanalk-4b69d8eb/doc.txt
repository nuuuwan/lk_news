Nepal Army to take charge of security following violent protests

The Nepal Army on Tuesday said that it will take charge of security operations from 10 pm, hours after Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli resigned following 27 hours of violent protests in Kathmandu and other parts of the country.

In a statement issued by the Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the army said that “some groups are taking undue advantage of the difficult situation and causing severe damage to ordinary citizens and public property”.

It warned that all security mechanisms, including the Nepal Army, will be mobilised to contain the violence if such activities continue.

The Nepal Army also appealed for public cooperation, urging citizens not to engage in or support destructive acts.

Violence continued on Tuesday in several parts of Nepal even after Prime Minister Oli’s resignation, which appeared to have little effect on the protesters who set fire to the Parliament, the President’s Office, PM’s residence, the Supreme Court, political party offices and homes of senior leaders.

Prime Minister Oli quit shortly after hundreds of agitators entered his office demanding his resignation for the death of at least 19 people in police action during Monday’s protests by Gen Z over corruption and a government ban on social media. The ban on social media was lifted Monday night. PTI SBP GSP GSP
