HelpAge SL and HelpAge Deutschland empower senior citizens through HASOP

HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL) in partnership with HelpAge Deutschland (HAD), is making a significant impact on the lives of older persons through the HelpAge Sri Lanka Older Persons’ Empowerment Project (HASOP).

Launched in December 2024, the project continues through the end of 2025, working across Galle, Matara, and Hambantota districts to promote dignity, inclusion, and active participation for senior citizens.

The HASOP adopts a holistic approach to elder empowerment, integrating advocacy for rights, improved access to healthcare, sustainable livelihood development, and strengthened leadership within Senior Citizens’ Clubs (SCCs).

“Through HASOP, we are not just delivering services — we are creating empowered communities where elders lead, contribute, and thrive,” said HASL Head of Programs Chaminda De Silva. “This project is redefining how society views ageing—not as a burden, but as a phase of life full of potential. We are equipping older persons with the tools, knowledge, and confidence to advocate for their rights and take ownership of their well-being.”

According to De Silva, the project is being implemented across over 10 Divisional Secretariats—Niyagama, Elpitiya, Galle Four Gravets, and Welivitiya Divithura (Galle District); Weligama, Thihagoda, and Kamburupitiya (Matara District); and Sooriyawewa, Lunugamvehera, and Thissamaharama (Hambantota District).

Achievements to date include the strengthening of 100+ SCCs through leadership and governance training, delivery of 100 health workshops with screenings, distribution of medical equipment, training of Home Care Volunteers, and support for elder-led livelihoods through skills training and micro-loans. Project sustainability planning is underway, with exit meetings, audits, and a final evaluation set for November to December 2025.

“HAD is committed to enabling people to live with dignity in old age. Our collaboration with HASL—though relatively new—is grounded in a shared mission to improve the lives of vulnerable older individuals, their families, and communities,’’ said HAD Project Manager Verena Berndt.

She said that HAD is proud to support HASL’s decades-long efforts in elder care, from mobile medical services to home care volunteer networks and cataract surgeries. “Together, we work to strengthen social protection, promote income security for older persons, and respond effectively to humanitarian needs—always as equal partners in development and humanitarian cooperation. By advocating for policy changes and shifting societal perceptions, we aim to build an inclusive future where older people are seen, heard, and valued, she said.”

HASL Executive Director Dr. Harasha Bandara said that the HASOP stands as a national model for age-inclusive development. “We believe that growing older should not be seen as a limitation, but rather as a powerful opportunity for continued contribution, leadership, and active citizenship.”

He reiterated that as a charity dedicated to serving the needs of Sri Lanka’s ageing population since 1986, HASL recognises that the support of international organisations goes a long way in sustaining and expanding our meaningful work. “Together, we are shaping a future where every older person can live with dignity, respect, and purpose,” he said.
