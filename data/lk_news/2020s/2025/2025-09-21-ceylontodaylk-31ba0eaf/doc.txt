World Athletics Championships Tokyo 2025 Ends in Style with Records, Farewells, and First-Time Winners

The final day of the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo was a fitting climax to nine days of thrilling competition at the Japan National Stadium. From record-breaking performances to emotional farewells, Sunday (21) delivered a full spectrum of sporting drama.

USAâ€™s Melissa Jefferson-Wooden etched her name in history by completing the sprint treble â€” winning the 100m, 200m, and anchoring the victorious 4x100m relay team. She became only the second woman to achieve this feat after Jamaicaâ€™s Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who bowed out of her World Championships career with a silver medal in the same race.

USA claimed gold in the womenâ€™s 4x100m, menâ€™s 4x100m, and womenâ€™s 4x400m â€” the latter in a championship record time of 3:16.61. However, Botswana stunned the field in the menâ€™s 4x400m, with Collen Kebinatshipi chasing down Rai Benjamin in the final stretch to win gold in 2:57.76.

Germanyâ€™s Leo Neugebauer emerged victorious in a dramatic decathlon, scoring 8804 points after a decisive javelin throw and a strong 1500m finish. The event saw several top contenders withdraw or falter, including Damian Warner and Pierce LePage.

Kenyaâ€™s Lilian Odira stunned the field in the womenâ€™s 800m, surging past Olympic and world champions to win in 1:54.62 â€” breaking the oldest championship record. It was the first time three women broke 1:55 in a single race.

After a disqualification in the 1500m semifinals, USAâ€™s Cole Hocker bounced back to win the 5000m in 12:58.30, outkicking a strong field that included Isaac Kimeli and Jimmy Gressier.

Australiaâ€™s Nicola Olyslagers cleared 2.00m to win her first outdoor world title in a rain-soaked final. She edged Polandâ€™s Maria Zodzik on countback, while Yaroslava Mahuchikh and Angelina Topic shared bronze.

Swedenâ€™s Daniel Stahl delivered a clutch final-round throw of 70.47m to win his third world discus title. The rain-delayed event ended with Samoaâ€™s Alex Rose earning his countryâ€™s first global athletics medal.
