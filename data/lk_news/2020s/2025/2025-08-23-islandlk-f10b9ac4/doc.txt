India-China Ties Can Fall Short Without Pakistan

It is far too soon for the self-styled ‘advocates’ of the Global South to hail Trump’s tariff theatrics, when most of these countries still rule through propaganda and oppression, not transparent institutions. Equally, it is premature to herald the so-called “honeymoon” between India and China; yet it remains crucial to observe these developments with measured attention.

Last Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Delhi, inaugurating a series of dialogues signaling a renewed impetus in India-China bilateral relations. Within hours, President Xi Jinping arrived in Lhasa to preside over the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Xizang Autonomous Region. As the Dalai Lama’s spiritual and administrative succession remains uncertain while he resides in India, administering his “transnational government” with historical support from both India and the United States, and as India contends with its own domestic and regional complexities, Beijing has been consolidating influence over its periphery, particularly through intensifying engagements with Prime Minister Shehbaz’s Pakistan and with Yunus’s Bangladesh. These manoeuvres directly challenge India’s strategic equilibrium and accentuate the imperative for Delhi to recalibrate its regional and global posture.

China’s approach to its neighbourhood manifests a meticulous choreography, leveraging historical grievances and economic inducements to cultivate alignment that constrains India’s strategic manoeuvrability. This long-term positioning has often been interpreted through Western prisms as aggressive expansionism, yet such readings risk oversimplifying the nuanced calculus Beijing applies in balancing India’s neighbours. India, for its part, has a storied history of learning from misjudgements: from Jawaharlal Nehru’s overestimation of Sino-Indian amity to Indira Gandhi’s democratic erosions, these episodes have evinced the costs of strategic complacency. More than ever, India’s contemporary leadership must internalize these lessons to pre-empt the constriction of its regional space by external actors.

The historical context of India-Pakistan relations accentuates the necessity for dialogue even amidst intractable hostilities. Both nations now maintain nuclear arsenals sufficient to annihilate entire regions, rendering any escalation potentially catastrophic. Pakistan has, over decades, adeptly manipulated strategic patronage, oscillating between the United States and China, to reinforce its posture against India. During the Cold War, Pakistan exploited American strategic imperatives and Sino-Soviet rivalries to sustain asymmetrical advantages, fomenting crises that constrained Indian options. India, however, in the post-Cold War era, has progressively leveraged its Western partnerships and technological prowess to reconstruct its geopolitical standing, exemplified by the proliferation of Indian-origin executives and policy shapers within global corporations, as well as in transnational political influence.

At this juncture, India’s domestic and diplomatic capacities under Prime Minister Narendra Modi invite sober reflection on the vision of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, India’s first Bharatiya Janata Party Prime Minister, who meticulously adapted his ambitions to safeguard peace and regional stability. Vajpayee’s approach to diplomacy was suffused with strategic creativity and statesmanship. His historic bus journey to Lahore in 1999, despite the looming Kargil conflict, was not merely a symbolic overture but an embodiment of India’s potential to reconcile with Pakistan through structured dialogue. He declared, “I have never despaired, and I have always believed that friendship with Pakistan is possible, but it must be based on reality, not illusions.” Vajpayee understood that enduring regional stability necessitates both the audacity to initiate dialogue and the prudence to prepare for contingencies. This duality remains instructive for contemporary policy formulation.

India’s lessons from Vajpayee’s tenure extend beyond the Indo-Pakistani framework. He demonstrated the ability to integrate domestic political plurality with strategic diplomacy, thereby reconfiguring the psyche of the Indian polity towards measured realism. In foreign affairs, he consistently evinced a capacity to reconcile competing imperatives—nuclear deterrence, economic integration, and regional engagement—into a coherent doctrine. His reflection, “Peace is not the absence of conflict, but the presence of justice,” captures the ethos that must animate India’s current regional strategy. Modi’s government, benefiting from a more robust institutional apparatus and a prolonged mandate, possesses the operational latitude to translate these lessons into tangible policy outcomes.

The current trajectory of India-China relations provides an unprecedented opportunity, as long as India’s capability and willingness to normalize relations with Pakistan are maintained. Following Modi’s engagement with Xi Jinping during the Kazan summit, and the ongoing dialogue mediated through Special Representatives Ajit Doval and Wang Yi, both nations have committed to a calibrated resumption of diplomatic and trade exchanges. The statements emanating from these dialogues evince a shared recognition that rivalry need not preclude collaboration: “India and China are partners, not rivals,” Modi asserted, emphasizing mutual growth and the imperative of preventing boundary divergences from metastasizing into conflict. Wang Yi, in consonance, articulated that the implementation of the Kazan consensus enables bilateral ties to enter “a new course of improvement and development,” reflecting Beijing’s acknowledgment of the strategic reciprocity inherent in stable Sino-Indian relations.

This is precisely where India must address the internalised dimensions of hostility with Pakistan. The perpetuation of a warmongering psyche within segments of the Pakistani polity, combined with entrenched narratives within certain Indian political constituencies, sustains a cycle of mistrust. Constructive engagement necessitates not capitulating to immediate provocations but fostering sustained channels of communication, intelligence sharing, resource sharing, and multilateral engagement to gradually recalibrate perceptions on both sides. Here, Vajpayee’s methodology—prioritizing incremental confidence-building measures alongside assertive deterrence—remains a template of enduring relevance.

India’s ability to draw on Vajpayee’s legacy is evident in the regional context. Like ASEAN and the EU, India has the demographic, economic, and political weight to foster South Asian stability. Vajpayee emphasized that “India’s role in the region is not to dominate but to harmonize,” a principle that today requires both strong defence and proactive engagement with Pakistan and China.

A critical dimension involves India’s engagement with internal and external narratives surrounding China. Excessive reliance on Western framings risks constraining autonomous strategic judgment. India’s diplomatic apparatus will have to parse Beijing’s manoeuvres—whether in Bangladesh, Pakistan, or along the Himalayan frontier—through empirically grounded, historically informed lenses. By doing so, India can identify and close spaces for hostility, pre-empt asymmetric pressures, and utilize multilateral platforms to consolidate regional stability without compromising, as Dr S. Jaishankar noted this week, “mutual sensitivities.” As Vajpayee reflected, “The path to peace is paved with courage, dialogue, and vision,” and contemporary India possesses both the institutional apparatus and strategic patience to operationalise this vision.

The confluence of historical insight, leadership continuity, and geopolitical opportunity situates India at a singular juncture. Modi’s longevity in office facilitates the calibration of policies that are both consistent and adaptive, reducing the volatility that often hampers South Asian diplomacy. As Sino-Indian dialogues advance—from boundary management to trade—India can stabilize its eastern frontier while cautiously engaging Pakistan. Drawing on Vajpayee’s statesmanship, the country must confront historical hostilities, institutionalize dialogue, and deploy economic and technological leverage to counter coercion. As Modi observed, “The emerging Asian century is closely associated with India-China cooperation,” a principle equally relevant across Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal, making diplomacy, deterrence, and development central to India’s strategic posture in an era of nuclear parity and evolving multipolarity.
