Nepal Protests: Kathmandu Airport reopens for civilian flights

The Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal has announced that Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport, Nepal’s main gateway, has reopened.

Domestic and international flights, suspended since Tuesday, “will resume today,” the authority said in a statement, without elaborating.

The shutdown had left hundreds of international tourists, including Indians, stranded amid the deadly unrest.

Meanwhile, SriLankan Airlines informed Ada Derana that it will resume flights to Nepal from tomorrow (11).

The situation in Nepal remained relatively calm on Wednesday, following two days of youth-led “Gen Z” protests that turned violent after a security crackdown left at least 19 demonstrators — mostly students — dead.

With Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and his cabinet having resigned, and as law enforcement struggled to maintain control, the Nepal Army took charge of security on Tuesday night.

The military appealed for public cooperation, urging citizens to refrain from destructive acts, and warned that all security mechanisms would be deployed if violence persisted.
