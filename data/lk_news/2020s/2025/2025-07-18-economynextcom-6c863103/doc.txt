Sri Lanka SOE sales not completed due to following proper procedure: ex-President

ECONOMYNEXT – Sales of several state firms which were on line to be privatized could not be completed due to time it took to follow proper procedures, ex-President Ranil Wickemesinghe said.

“There was a committee, the members of the committee insisted that they follow all the proper steps,” Wickremesinghe said at a forum on organized by Advocata Institute, a Colombo-based think tank.

“I used to push them but they said ‘We do not want questions coming up later and for us to be locked up. So they followed the procedure.”

Wickremesinghe said there was no ‘delay’ as such but the process was time consuming.

By the time it came to July (2024) there were offers from investors but it was too close to polls and it would have become an election issue and he said not to go ahead, Wickremesinghe said.

“Otherwise, they could have been finished by December,” he said.

When he wanted to speed up the transactions the International Monetary Fund also said proper procedure should be followed, he said. (Colombo/July18/2025)
