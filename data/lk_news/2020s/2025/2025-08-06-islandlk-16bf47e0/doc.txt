Intrepid together with MDF and SLTDA conducts empowering women in tourism capacity-building sessions in Bandarawela

Intrepid Colombo has successfully concluded the third chapter of its transformative “Women in Tourism” initiative, expanding its reach to the Uva Province with two impactful capacity-building sessions held recently in Bandarawela.

Conducted in partnership with Australia’s Market Development Facility (MDF) and the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), the session welcomed a group of enthusiastic participants across two specialized workshops designed to empower women at different stages of their tourism careers.

The first session brought together women business owners already working within the tourism industry, while the second welcomed aspiring and current female tour leaders, creating a comprehensive approach to women’s empowerment across the tourism value chain. Since its inception in September 2024, the program has seen a remarkable success.

“What makes this iteration particularly exciting is how we’ve tailored our approach to meet women where they are in their careers,” said Poornaka Delpachitra, Country GM of Intrepid. “Whether they’re established business owners looking to scale up or aspiring tour leaders taking their first steps into the industry, we’re providing the tools, networks, and confidence they need to succeed. The enthusiasm and engagement we witnessed in Bandarawela was truly inspiring.”
