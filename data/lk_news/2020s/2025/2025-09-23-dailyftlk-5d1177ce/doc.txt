People’s Bank partners Justice Ministry to drive countrywide court digitalisation

People’s Bank yesterday announced a collaboration with the Justice Ministry and the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka to introduce digital payment solutions across the judicial system.

The ceremonial launch took place at the Sri Lanka Judges’ Institute Auditorium, in the presence of Chief Justice Preethi Padman Surasena, Justice Minister Eranga Weeraratne, Chief Presidential Adviser on Digital Economy Dr. Hans Wijayasuriya, Attorney General Parinda Ranasinghe, PC, Judges of the Supreme Court/Members of Judicial Service Commission S. Thuraijara PC and Mahinda Samayawardena, Justice Secretary Ayesha Jinasena PC, People’s Bank Chairman Prof. Narada Fernando, CEO Clive Fonseka, Deputy General Manager – Payment and Cards Nilmini Premalal, and Bar Association of Sri Lanka President Rajeev Amarasuriya.

As part of this national project, People’s Bank will deploy card acceptance facilities at courts throughout the country. This will enable litigants, attorneys, and the public to make secure, cashless payments conveniently—enhancing efficiency, transparency, and accountability in the judicial process.

In addition to system deployment, People’s Bank is conducting awareness and training programs for Supreme Court staff members and other court officials. These sessions provide practical guidance on the use of digital payment systems, operational processes, and customer service best practices, ensuring the smooth adoption of the new system.

Prof. Fernando said: “This partnership reflects People’s Bank’s commitment to supporting the Government’s vision for a digitally empowered nation. By collaborating with the Ministry of Justice and the Supreme Court, we aim to modernise payment infrastructure in the judicial sector while improving service delivery for all citizens.”

Fonseka said: “As Sri Lanka’s leading bank in digitalisation and innovation, we are proud to be part of this national initiative, which is closely aligned with the Government’s digitalisation roadmap. This project underscores our role as a key driver of financial inclusion and technological advancement across the country.”
