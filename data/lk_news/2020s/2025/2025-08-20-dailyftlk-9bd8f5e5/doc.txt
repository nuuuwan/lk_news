Econsulate launches Sri Lanka’s first platform in ground–air robotics

Econsulate has launched Sri Lanka’s first platform in ground–air robotics.

Named “Xavier 4.0” it is a mission-ready platform combining the power of the RG 311 #UGV and the Beak B 150 #UAV, designed and developed from the ground up, into one seamless autonomous platform.

“With all-terrain mobility, autonomous navigation, 3D spatial mapping, rapid aerial deployment, and high-definition imaging working in harmony, it redefines how ground and air intelligence operate together,” Econsulate said.

“Designed, engineered, and built entirely in Sri Lanka, Xavier 4.0 is the first of its kind in the region and places Econsulate among a select group of companies worldwide to achieve such integration. This is more than a technological achievement, it’s a milestone for Sri Lanka and a signal to the world that world-class innovation can rise from our shores,” the company added.
