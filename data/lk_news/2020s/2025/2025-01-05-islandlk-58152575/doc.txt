Ogilvy’s Geometry Global becomes only SL agency to win at global Epica Awards 2024

Geometry Global, a Strategic Business Unit of the Ogilvy Group Sri Lanka, achieved a significant milestone as Sri Lanka’s only agency to be recognised at the prestigious Epica Awards 2024. The agency secured a Bronze in the ‘Public Interest – Social Advocacy’ category for its meaningful ‘Books that Keep on Giving’ campaign for ProMate (Printxcel), a leading stationery manufacturer in Sri Lanka.

The Epica Awards are the only global creative awards judged by journalists from the marketing and communications industry, with the 2024 winners being evaluated in Paris by a jury of editors and media personnel from across Europe and the United States.

Geometry Global’s ‘Books that Keep on Giving’ initiative for ProMate Sri Lanka addresses the critical social need of supporting visually impaired students’ education amid Sri Lanka’s 300% surge in paper costs. Armed with the insight that over LKR 25 billion worth of paper are discarded annually in the country, the campaign called on the public to donate their used notebooks which were then upcycled for Braille writing. Repurposing the donated notebooks in this manner meant that they offered visually impaired students the same learning opportunities of a brand-new book, making them ‘Books that Keep on Giving’.

The Bronze award at Epica 2024 builds on Geometry Global’s recent success at the Dragons of Asia 2024, where the Agency clinched the coveted Blue Dragon for the ‘Best Campaign in Country’ and the Gold in the ‘Best Cause/Charity Marketing’ category.
