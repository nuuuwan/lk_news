Sri Lanka anti-corruption commission blocked by Treasury fiscal rule

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery of Commission is unable to carry out its functions after the Finance Ministry blocked its attempts to recruit staff citing fiscal rules, Director General Ranga Dissanayake said.

The is getting thousands of complaints but only has 169 investigations officers and out of a requirement of 75 legal officers only 31 were available.

The CIABOC needs around 967 staff but the Treasury has blocked recruitment saying it has to approve salaries and the cadre under a new fiscal management law, he said.

Dissanayake said the intention of the anti-corruption act was for the agency to be independent, to combat corruption but Treasury had claimed that the Fiscal Law had precedence.

He did not believe it to be the case and the Speaker of the Parliament had sought the advice of the Attorney General.

Those who drew up the law and had envisage the Finance Ministry blocking funds and had an alternative mechanism of getting outside donations from local or international sources.

However, that process was beset with potential problems as the motives of the donors and he preferred resolve the problem through other means.

The anti-corruption commission had sent the list of cadres and funding to the Treasury for observations and not approval, he said as such approval was not required under the CIABOC governing law.

At a meeting with the President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in June a request had been made to solve the problem in a week, but no objections had been raised by the Treasury at the time, he said.

Several months later the letter had come informing of the fiscal rules, he said, delaying the full functioning of the commission.

At the moment the Commission had police officers on secondment probing complaints but all staff were overwhelmed, he said. (Colombo/Oct02/2025)
