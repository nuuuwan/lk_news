Japanese JDR medical team arrives in Sri Lanka

In a continued demonstration of solidarity with Sri Lanka following the devastation caused by Cyclone Ditwah, Japan has dispatched a Japan Disaster Relief (JDR) medical team to strengthen emergency humanitarian operations.

The 27-member team, comprising doctors, medical experts, relief personnel and rescue specialists, arrived in Colombo Wednesday night, marking a significant contribution to Sri Lanka’s ongoing disaster-response and medical-assistance efforts. With four members having been deployed earlier, a total of 31 JDR personnel are now engaged in supporting Sri Lanka’s post-cyclone relief efforts.

Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka Akio Isomata along with Head of the JDR Medical Team Kiichiro Iwase formally handed over the 27 deployed personnel including medics, doctors, and relief/rescue Personnel to Sri Lankan authorities.

The medical team will be working in coordination with national agencies to provide critical on-ground medical support, bolster relief operations, and assist in areas where health services have been severely disrupted due to the cyclone.
