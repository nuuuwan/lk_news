Spotlight on Michael de Silva

Michael de Silva certainly has a fan base in Sri Lanka, although he now lives in Switzerland.

Last week’s story about Suzi Croner (Flückiger) coming this way with a Swiss outfit, the Willy Schere Band, had quite a lot of readers querying about one particular member of the band … and he happened to be Michael de Silva.

They all seem eager to see him in action, in Colombo, and he will be doing just that, with Suzi and the Willy Schere Band at the Oktoberfest celebrations, at Cinnamon Lakeside.

In the past, Micheal, who studied at St. Peter;s College, Bambalapitiya, has performed with several well-known outfits, including Purple Rain – in their original lineup.

Suzi, in the meanwhile, indicated that she had a heavy workload, in Switzerland, before her departure for Colombo.

From Colombo, she would be heading for Australia for her Country Road concert, in October.
