The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) is in high-level talks to establish an innovation hub in Sri Lanka that will connect universities, industry, and Government institutions with international research expertise, the President’s Media Division (PMD) said.

At a meeting held at the Presidential Secretariat on  Tuesday, RMIT officials and senior representatives of the Secretariat discussed the initiative, which is being coordinated through the National Initiative for Research and Development Commercialisation (NIRDC).

According to the PMD, the proposed RMIT Sri Lanka Innovation Hub will strengthen joint doctoral programs, align research with national priorities, and expand opportunities for commercialising innovation.

The hub is also expected to provide training and global access for local researchers, students, and professionals, while creating avenues for new funding and investment into Sri Lanka’s R&D sector.

Participants at the discussion included Senior Additional Secretary to the President Russell Aponso, RMIT Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Innovation) Prof. Calum Drummond, STEM College Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Innovation) Prof. Sujeewa Sethunga, NIRDC Director General Dr. Muditha D. Senarath Yapa, and other officials.
