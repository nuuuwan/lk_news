Sri Lanka’s first plastic testing lab debuts

GP Certified has announced the launch of GP Labs, Sri Lanka’s first and only dedicated plastic testing facility, designed to bring scientific precision and international quality standards to the country’s growing plastic recycling and polymer manufacturing sectors.

With plastic waste and sustainability becoming global concerns, Sri Lanka’s recycling sector has often faced the challenge of the lack of scientific validation for recycled plastic. GP Labs directly addresses this gap by offering comprehensive testing for both recycled and virgin plastics, enabling recyclers, manufacturers, and FMCG brands to ensure their products meet the highest standards in quality, safety, and environmental responsibility.

Located close to Colombo, GP Labs offers an extensive range of plastic testing services across general, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties. This includes tests such as tensile strength (ASTM D638), melt flow rate (ISO 1133), ash content, colour analysis, and oxidation induction time. The lab is fully equipped to evaluate common plastic types like PET, HDPE, LDPE, PP, PVC, and PS in various forms including pellets, flakes, and finished goods.

In addition to plastics testing, GP Labs also provides environmental monitoring services, including indoor air quality and water testing for production facilities which is an important feature for manufacturers committed to safe, compliant, and sustainable operations.

The lab offers several flexible service models: GP Test Assay: A full-spectrum test package for recycled plastics; Individual Testing: Customised testing based on material type or need and

Environmental Monitoring: Testing for air, water, and emissions in industrial environments

Custom Services: Tailored solutions for R&D and new polymer innovation.

With rapid turnaround times, instant digital reporting, and cost-effective packages, GP Labs aims to elevate the standard of plastic processing in Sri Lanka while supporting industry growth and compliance with international benchmarks.

GP Certified Chief Technical Officer Yugantha Perera said: “GP Labs is a major step forward for Sri Lanka’s recycling and manufacturing industries. It not only promotes quality but also builds the credibility of recycled plastics for local and global markets.”

GP Labs is now open to recyclers, manufacturers, and exporters looking to validate, improve, and scale their plastic products responsibly.
