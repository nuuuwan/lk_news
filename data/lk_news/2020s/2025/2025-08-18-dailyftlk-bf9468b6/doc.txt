Partnership brings iconic Italian design and sustainable mobility to the Maldives’ high-luxury hospitality sector

Trade Promoters Ltd. (TPL), a leader in engineering and energy solutions across Sri Lanka and the Maldives, has signed an exclusive distributor agreement with Kinetic Green Tonino Lamborghini Ltd. to introduce the iconic Tonino Lamborghini electric golf carts to the Maldives.

Under this agreement, TPL becomes the sole distributor for the Maldives, overseeing sales, marketing, and after-sales service for the luxury electric golf cart range through its dealer in the Maldives Electrify Maldives Ltd. The partnership merges global design and manufacturing excellence with local expertise – delivering Italian design with cutting-edge Indian electric vehicle technology to the Maldives.

“We are excited to introduce the elegance, innovation, and performance of Tonino Lamborghini electric golf carts to the Maldives,” said Trade Promoters Ltd. Joint Managing Director Ranil H. Fernando. “Since 2019, TPL—through its appointed dealer, Electrify Maldives—has delivered reliable power and engineering solutions across all sectors in the Maldives. We support over 120 of the 187 operational resorts and work closely with various businesses and SOEs operating in the country.”

“We are proud to appoint Trade Promoters Pvt Ltd. as our exclusive partner for the Maldives,” said Ferruccio Lamborghini, Vice President of Tonino Lamborghini SpA and Director of Kinetic Green Tonino Lamborghini Pvt Ltd. “Their deep-rooted presence in the region, commitment to service excellence, and proven track record in representing premium global brands make them the perfect ambassador for Tonino Lamborghini electric golf carts. The Maldives is a high-luxury destination that mirrors our brand values of sophistication, performance, and Italian design—and we are confident that Trade Promoters Pvt Ltd. will deliver this experience with integrity and passion.”

In a landmark unveiling on 17 July, Kinetic Green Energy and Power Solutions Ltd. of India and Tonino Lamborghini SpA of Italy debuted their exclusive range of electric golf and lifestyle carts. Meticulously crafted to redefine luxury mobility, the vehicles fuse world-class Italian design with Kinetic Green’s expertise in electric vehicle technology.

“For a long time, the golf cart segment has awaited a true disruptor—an offering that transcends the mundane,” said Kinetic Green Founder and CEO Dr. Sulajja Firodia Motwani. “Over the years, golf carts have extended their reach beyond fairways to luxury resorts, airports, and even private estates, yet the design remained stagnant. This is where we see immense global potential for a bold, premium alternative.”

A symbol of refined luxury, the Tonino Lamborghini electric golf carts were designed in Italy and will be manufactured in India. They will carry the iconic red shield with the charging bull—hallmarks of the brand’s Italian heritage. Available globally, these vehicles represent the future of high-end electric mobility.
