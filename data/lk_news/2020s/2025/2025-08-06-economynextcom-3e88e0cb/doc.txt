Sri Lanka sees foreign buying in rupee bonds amid certainty over Trump tariff

ECONOMYNEXT – Foreign investors bought Sri Lanka government securities after selling in the previous week, the Central Bank data showed, as the week ended on July 31 saw some certainty over U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff, analysts said.

Foreign investors bought 1,664 million rupee ($5.55 million) worth of government securities in the week ended on July 31, after suffering a 1.4 million dollars outflow in the previous week.

Global investors have been waiting for positive news from U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff threats and the week saw Trump’s administration announcing the tariff for many countries including 20 percent for Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka suffered an outflow of 10.1 billion rupees in the two weeks soon after Trump’s tariff declaration in the first week of April and the rupee has fallen slightly since then, while global investors have been shifting to safe-havens like gold.

The island nation has, however, enjoyed a total inflow of 30.3 billion rupees (around $101 million) into rupee bonds since December 26 last year through July 31, the data showed.

Sri Lanka’s deflationary policies have helped to see inflows amid curtailed imports, analysts have said.

The country witnessed foreign outflows worth 48.2 billion rupees in 2024 with 66 percent or 78.1 billion rupees worth outflow from the government securities in the first nine months of last year. (Colombo/July 26/2025)
