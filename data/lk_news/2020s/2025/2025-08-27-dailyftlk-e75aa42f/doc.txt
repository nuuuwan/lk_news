Model Children and Women’s Bureau opens at Colombo North Police station

Embassy of Japan Head of Economic and Development Cooperation Kenji Ohashi, and UNFPA Sri Lanka Assistant Representative Dr. Dayanath Ranatunga, handed over the newly constructed Japan-funded Model Children and Women’s Bureau (MCWB) at the Colombo North (Modara) Police Station to Sri Lanka Police. The Bureau, formerly known as the Emergency Waiting Area (EWA), represents a strengthened approach to supporting survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) and child abuse with dignity, privacy, and protection.

Police Inspector General Priyantha Weerasuriya, Western Province SDIG Sanjeewa Dharmarathne, officers representing the Women and Children Abuse Investigation Range, World Vision Lanka National Director Dr. Dhanan Senathirajah, senior officers of the Sri Lanka Police, officials from the District Secretariat, and representatives from World Vision Lanka were present at the ceremony.

The Colombo North MCWB joins a growing network of 14 operational facilities across Sri Lanka, including Jaffna, Batticaloa, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Kalutara, Mirihana, Mundalam, and others. In 2024 alone, over 4,000 women and children received support through these spaces. MCWBs provide survivors with private and confidential environments, access to psychosocial support, medical referrals, legal aid, and pathways to justice. Child-friendly play areas and disability-inclusive design ensure that every survivor and their family can access services in a safe and supportive environment.

Speaking at the event, Ranatunga, underscored the importance of survivor-cantered responses: “When a survivor takes that first, frightening step to seek help, what they encounter in that moment matters deeply. It can be the difference between hope and despair, between safety and continued harm, between seeking justice and retreating into silence. Survivors who walk through these doors should be met with empathy, confidentiality, and respect. She should see in your actions the assurance that violence is not tolerated, and that she is not alone.”

Ohashi reaffirmed Japan’s support to Sri Lanka’s efforts in ending violence against women and children: “Japan has been a committed partner in promoting the Women, Peace and Security agenda in Sri Lanka. The establishment of these Model Bureaus marks an important step towards building a safer, more secure, and inclusive society. We look forward to the day when Sri Lanka will be free from gender and child-related challenges.”

Weerasuriya emphasised the role of the police in upholding survivor dignity: “For survivors, approaching the police can be one of the most difficult steps. Through these Model Bureaus, we ensure that survivors are met with compassion and professionalism, and that their dignity and safety are protected at all times. The Sri Lanka Police is committed to ensuring these spaces function to their fullest potential, and that every survivor is provided the support and justice they deserve.”

The establishment of the Colombo North MCWB was made possible through the generous funding of the People of Japan, with construction supported by World Vision Lanka, and implemented by UNFPA Sri Lanka in partnership with the Public Security Ministry and Sri Lanka Police.

UNFPA Sri Lanka expressed its deep appreciation to the People of Japan, the Public Security Ministry the Sri Lanka Police, and World Vision Lanka for their invaluable contributions in creating a safer environment for survivors of violence across the country.
