Dialogue Across Worlds: Science, Spirituality, & The Journey Of A Book

About the Author: Bhante Missaka Kamalasiri, a Buddhist monk of Sri Lankan origin, has spent decades exploring the Himalayan spiritual landscape. Far beyond the role of a traveler, he has immersed himself in spiritual practice and direct experience, guided by his teacher, Ananda Maitriya Mahasthavir. Drawing inspiration from the wisdom of the Himalayas, his work bridges culture, spirituality, and human understanding, reminiscent of the contributions of Alexandra David Neel and Paul Brunton.

In a conversation that meandered like the mountain trails he once walked, Bhante Missaka Kamalasiri reflected on the broader vision behind his book, Whispering Echoes of the Himalayas.

“I never intended this work to be confined within the boundaries of a single cultural or religious community,” he explains. “Its reflections are relevant both East and West. It embraces intra-faith and inter-faith dialogue, but also reaches beyond religion, touching environmental concerns, anthropology, and human sciences.”

“The goal,” he continues, “was to gently guide travelers and anthropologists into spiritual reflection, while allowing those immersed in religious life to reconnect with the rhythms of ordinary existence. I wanted to create a bridge between worlds.”

Reflecting on the challenge of reaching such diverse readers, Bhante Missaka Kamalasiri smiles. “It was a deliberate effort. I cannot yet judge how successful I have been—that belongs to the readers. But in our modern world, scientific clarity and spiritual depth must walk together. This book is my attempt to make that union visible.”

When asked about the foreword by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, he humbly remarks, “It is a profound honor. His Holiness embodies compassion and wisdom. For him to endorse this work reflects its spirit: bridging cultures, traditions, and perspectives.”

“I have walked this path guided by my teacher, Ananda Maitriya Mahasthavir. These experiences form the foundation of the book, allowing readers to witness the Himalayan journey not as a distant traveler, but through lived spiritual insight.”

His inspirations extend to thinkers such as Alexandra David Neel and Paul Brunton. “Like Brunton and Neel,” he notes, “I aim to connect exploration, education, and spiritual insight. The book invites dialogue across worlds, between science and spirituality, anthropology and religion, the individual and the universal.”

By the end of our conversation, the mountains themselves seemed to speak through him. “My hope,” he says, “is that readers will be drawn into these dialogues, discovering new sensitivities and insights, and finding that spirituality is intertwined with the very fabric of our world.”
