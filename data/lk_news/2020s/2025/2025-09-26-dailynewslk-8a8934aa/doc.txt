Sri Lanka Expected to Reach Pre-Crisis Economic Levels by 2026 – President

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake says Sri Lanka is on course to restore its economy to the level it was in 2019, before the onset of the financial crisis, by next year.

Speaking in New York at a meeting with Sri Lankans living in the United States, on the sidelines of the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly, the President noted that the country, which declared bankruptcy in 2022, has since made remarkable progress in overcoming the crisis.

“Sri Lankans abroad gave immense support during the presidential election, both financially and morally. Their contribution was vital to our victory,” he said, recalling how his party grew from just 3% of the vote in 2019 to securing the presidency in 2024 and achieving the highest number of parliamentary seats in Sri Lanka’s history.

President Dissanayake also reflected on the challenges faced after Sri Lanka’s official debt default on April 12, 2022, which he described as a turning point.

“One of our key tasks was to stabilize the economy and ensure that such a collapse would never happen again. We were able to resolve the crisis significantly within a short period,” he said.

He added that international organizations, credit rating agencies, and financial institutions have recognized Sri Lanka’s rapid recovery, which many experts had predicted would take at least a decade.

“If our collapse was in 2022, by those calculations it should take until 2032 to recover. But we are confident that by next year, we will return to the economic conditions of 2019,” the President emphasized.
