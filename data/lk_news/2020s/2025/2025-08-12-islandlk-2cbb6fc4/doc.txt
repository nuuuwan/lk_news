Vietnamese conglomerate evincing keen interest in SL’s renewable energy sector

Sri Lanka’s renewable energy ambitions are drawing the attention of some of Vietnam’s largest corporations, with the ROX Group — a leading Vietnamese business conglomerate — signaling its intent to explore major investments in the country’s power sector.

Yesterday ROX Group chairman Le Anh Due and a high-level executive team met with Power and Energy Minister Eng. Kumara Jayakody at the ministry’s Colombo office. The meeting was a direct outcome of the agreements and ties strengthened during President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s recent official visit to Vietnam, some observers said.

According to the minister’s Media Secretary, the Vietnamese executives expressed particular interest in the development of large-scale renewable energy projects, with solar and wind power generation at the forefront of discussions. Their focus areas include the Northern and Eastern Provinces, which are home to some of Sri Lanka’s highest solar irradiance levels and strongest wind corridors. The delegation will conduct a field inspection of potential project sites in these regions this week.

Minister Jayakody welcomed the interest from Vietnam, emphasising Sri Lanka’s improving investment climate.

“We have accelerated the implementation of projects that contribute to the growth of our electricity sector. As one of the most stable countries in the region with strong public support for development, we offer a very positive environment for foreign investors, he told The Island Financial Review.

The ROX Group has a diversified global footprint, with investments and operational experience in the UK, several European markets and across Central Asia, including Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan. During discussions, company executives outlined their technical expertise and shared lessons from large-scale renewable energy projects abroad, noting how Sri Lanka’s geographical advantages could be leveraged to create a sustainable, profitable energy base.
