Pali grammar book launched in Sri Lanka

ECONOMYNEXT – An ancient Pali grammar book ‘Balawatharo’ has been reprinted by Pathfinder Foundation with the support of the High Commission of India, Colombo and Indian Council of Cultural Relations (ICCR).

“The reprint will make this valuable text, which has, for generations, served as a cornerstone of Pali studies in Sri Lankan Pirivenas and schools, accessible to students of Pali in Sri Lanka,” the High Commission said.

Deputy High Commissioner Satyanjal Pandey launched the reprint at the sacred Dalada Maligawa Temple, Kandy.

Copies were presented to the chief prelates and other monks of the Malwatte and Asgiriya chapters.

Pathfinder, the High Commission, and ICCR have previously reprinted the Pali grammar treatise ‘Namamala’. (Colombo/Sep15/2025)
