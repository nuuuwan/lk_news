No takers for Sri Lanka Treasury bill tap issue for second week

ECONOMYNEXT – There were no takers for a post-auction sale of Sri Lanka Treasury bills, at the weighted average yield, after the main auction also saw less than offered bills sold.

At this week’s bond auction, less than offered bills were sold.

Sri Lanka’s banks have cut their bill portfolios as private credit expands and deposits have to be raised at higher rates, which can shrink their net interest margins. (Colombo/Aug11/2025)
