Sri Lanka speaker endorses Samurdhi, rubber control bills

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s speaker of parliament Jagath Wickramaratne has endorsed the certificates on the Samurdhi (Amendment) Bill and the Rubber Control (Amendment) Bill.

The bill to amend the Samurdhi Act, No. 1 of 2013 provides for the strengthening of financial accountability within financial institutions and the improvement of financial supervision of such institutions.

The amendment ensures compliance with the prevailing statutory and national auditing procedures by assigning the responsibility to audit the accounts of Samurdhi community-based banks and Samurdhi community-based banking societies to the National Audit Office.

This strengthens accountability within financial institutions, parliament said in a statement.

The Rubber Control (Amendment) Bill, which seeks to amend the Rubber Control Act, No. 11 of 1956, replaces the designations “Controller” and “Rubber Controller” with the title “Director-General,” providing for the control of the rubber development sector under the office of a Director-General.

The two bills will come into operation as the Samurdhi (Amendment) Act, No. 15 of 2025 and the Rubber Control (Amendment) Act, No. 16 of 2025. (Colombo/Aug28/2025)
