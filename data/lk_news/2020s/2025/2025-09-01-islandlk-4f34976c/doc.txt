Sri Lankan scene … for Ne-Yo

Ne-Yo, the renowned American singer, songwriter, record producer, dancer, and actor, who rose to fame in the early 2000s with his debut album ‘In My Own Words,’ is scheduled to perform live in Colombo in December, this year.

According to reports, the concert has already received the official endorsement of the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, recognising it as a flagship initiative in developing the country’s concert economy by attracting fans, and media, from all over South Asia.

Ne-Yo, who is primarily associated with R&B, pop, hip hop and soul, has won three Grammy Awards .

His hit singles include ‘So Sick’, ‘Sexy Love’, ‘Because of You’, ‘Closer’, Give Me Everything (feat. Nayer), and ‘Time of Our Lives’ (feat. Pitbull).

Ne-Yo’s itinerary for late 2025, includes dates in the US and Japan, with shows at venues like the Allegan County Fair in Allegan, Michigan, on 12 September, the Sandia Resort And Casino in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on 20 September, and the Glion Arena, in Kobe, Japan, on 27 September.

He is also scheduled to perform at Drai’s Nightclub, in Las Vegas, on October 10.

Girls, I’m told that Ne-Yo does leave an impression on his female fans—holding their energy at an all-time high – and that he is, without a doubt, a talented entertainer in his own right.
