The Foreign Ministry yesterday said Italy’s Deputy Foreign Minister Maria Tripodi will be in Sri Lanka from tomorrow for a three-day official visit.

According to the ministry, this will be the highest-level Italian visit to Colombo in nearly 10 years.

During her stay, Tripodi and Deputy Foreign Minister Arun Hemachandra will jointly chair the first round of Sri Lanka–Italy Political Consultations. The two Governments are expected to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to formalise a mechanism for regular political dialogue.

Tripodi is also scheduled to meet Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya and hold talks with Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath.
