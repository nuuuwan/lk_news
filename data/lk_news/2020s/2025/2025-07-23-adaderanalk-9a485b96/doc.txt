Doha-bound Air India flight faces technical snag; plane makes precautionary landing

A Doha-bound Air India Express flight from Calicut International Airport was forced to return on Wednesday morning due to a technical fault, airport officials confirmed. The aircraft was carrying 188 passengers, including crew and pilots.

The plane landed safely back at the airport after a two-hour journey. Flight IX 375 took off from Calicut at around 9.07 am but made a return landing at 11.12 am due to a fault in the cabin air conditioning system.

“There was some technical issue in the aircraft’s cabin AC. It was not an emergency landing,” an airport official clarified. Passengers were safely deboarded upon return. According to the airline, engineers were working to either rectify the issue or provide a replacement aircraft. An Air India Express spokesperson said it was a “precautionary landing” and that an alternative flight would be arranged for the passengers by 1.30 pm. “Till then all arrangements, like food and water, have been made for the passengers at the airport,” the spokesperson added.
