Over 19,000 overseas workers contribute to relief fund

Treasury Secretary Dr. Harshana Suriyapperuma said that as of Tuesday (2) over 19,000 Sri Lankans working abroad have contributed to the ‘Rebuilding Sri Lanka’ Fund, established to support national recovery efforts following the extensive damage caused by Cyclone Ditwah.

Delivering a special statement, the Secretary explained the ongoing initiatives undertaken by the Ministry in collaboration with other state institutions.

“A large number of our citizens are currently suffering due to the adverse weather conditions. While the Government is actively providing relief, many overseas Sri Lankans have also requested an opportunity to assist those affected by the disaster. Accordingly, the Finance Ministry, together with relevant state agencies, has implemented two coordinated mechanisms to facilitate such support,” he said.

“If overseas Sri Lankans experience difficulties transferring money through formal banking channels, they may send funds via their nearest Sri Lankan mission abroad. The assistance you provide whether funds or essential goods may reach your family member, neighbour or any Sri Lankan in need. At this critical moment, the support of everyone is essential to restore the lives of those affected,” Dr. Suriyapperuma added.
