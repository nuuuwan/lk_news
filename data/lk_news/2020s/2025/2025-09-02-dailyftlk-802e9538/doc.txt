NMSJ commends Election Commission on party registration policy

The National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) in a statement yesterday welcomed the stance of the Election Commission against registering new political parties based on ethnicity or religion.

In a statement, the Movement said that political parties seeking to govern Sri Lanka should act on national policies and goals, rather than narrow ethnic or religious agendas. It noted that Sri Lanka’s post-independence history shows how communal politics has often undermined national aspirations, and warned against passing such divisions on to future generations.

The NMSJ urged all stakeholders to support the Commission in ensuring that parties reflect inclusive national interests, calling the decision an important step for the country’s long-term unity and stability.
