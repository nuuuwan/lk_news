Sri Lanka’s central bank extends Pan Asia primary dealer ban for further 6 months

ECONOMYNEXT- Sri Lanka’s central bank will extend the ban on the primary dealership arm of Pan Asia Banking Corporation (PABC) for another six months, the company said in a stock exchange filing.

The central has said the suspension will have no bearing on the bank’s regular banking activities and trading on the secondary market.

PABC’s primary dealer license has been suspended since August 2017 for its transactions with Perpetual Treasuries Ltd during a securities fraud which caused losses to the state and the Employees’ Provident Fund, a superannuation fund of private sector worker savings. (Colombo/Aug15/2025)
