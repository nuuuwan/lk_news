The 27th Presidential Export Awards (PEA) ceremony, organised by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB), will take place on Thursday, 11 December 2025, at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH), under the patronage of President Anura Kumara Disanayake.

The Presidential Export Award is the highest recognition awarded by the President to Sri Lankan exporters who have made significant contributions to the export sector and the economic development of the country. This awards ceremony aims to honour exporters who have played a pivotal role in Sri Lanka’s economic growth.

The Presidential Export Awards program was launched by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board in 1981, and to date, 26 award ceremonies have been organised. Approximately 1,500 guests, including Cabinet Ministers, diplomatic officials, Government officials, and exporters, are expected to participate in the 27th Presidential Export Awards Ceremony.

This year’s awards ceremony is held to recognise Sri Lanka’s best exporters for the financial year 2024/2025. A total of 66 awards will be presented under two main categories, comprising 15 overall awards and 51 product and service sectoral awards. Additionally, merit awards will be presented to qualified sectors as determined by the panel of judges, taking into consideration the applicants’ performance as well as the export contribution of relevant sectors to the national economy. The selection of sectoral awards is based not only on export revenue but also on several other criteria, including export market diversification, employment generation, growth in export earnings, repatriation of export earnings to the country, environmental sustainability and corporate social responsibility, and value addition.

Demonstrating the export community’s enthusiasm for this prestigious award, a large number of applications were received by the Export Development Board this year. The initial evaluation of applications was conducted by the Technical Committee, and the selection of award winners was made by a distinguished panel of judges headed by a retired Honourable Judge of the Supreme Court. Ernst & Young (EY) serves as the “Knowledge Partner” for the 27th Presidential Export Awards Ceremony.

In line with the new Government’s policy framework, new strategies have been implemented to expand Sri Lanka’s exports, and it is expected that Sri Lanka’s exports will increase significantly as a result. Accordingly, the government considers the initiatives taken by exporters in areas such as market diversification, product diversification, innovation, value addition, introducing local brands to the world, sustainability of exports, and development of regional value chains as important for achieving its targets.

The Presidential Export Awards Ceremony presents winners with a trophy/plaque and certificate, and award recipients are entitled to use the Presidential Export Awards logo as a marketing tool for a period of three years.

The 27th Presidential Export Awards Ceremony is organised by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board under the supervision of EDB Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mangala Wijesinghe, under the guidance of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development Minister Sunil Handunneththi, and on the advice of Deputy Minister of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development Chathuranga Abeysinghe, and Secretary to the Ministry Thilaka Jayasundara.

People’s Bank has joined hands with the Sri Lanka Export Development Board as the Platinum Sponsor, while the Sri Lanka Tea Board and the Sri Lanka Export Credit Insurance Corporation serve as Silver Sponsors for the 27th Presidential Export Awards Ceremony, which is held to promote and encourage exports from Sri Lanka.
