Marking a significant milestone for the country’s healthcare industry, LAUGFS Life Sciences is advancing sterile infusion therapy production, reducing reliance on imports, delivering economic and clinical benefits, and positioning Sri Lanka as a regional hub for quality-driven pharmaceutical manufacturing through innovation, regulatory compliance, and private-sector investment.
