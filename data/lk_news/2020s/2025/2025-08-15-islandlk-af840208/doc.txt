Nestlé advances regenerative agricultural practices in the coconut value chain via Nestlé Coconut Development Plan

As part of the Nestlé Coconut Development Plan – the ‘Good Food Good Life’ company partnered with the Coconut Cultivation Board of Sri Lanka (CCB) to conduct a two-day training programme for coconut farmers. The training programme was initially launched in 2024. Building on its success, the second edition was introduced this year to further expand its reach and impact.

Conducted at CCB’s Coconut Development Training Center in Lunuwila, the programme trained 25 local coconut famers on the implementation of regenerative agriculture practices in their farms, benefiting the farmers in improving coconut yield whilst conserving natural resources such as soil and water.

Sharing his thoughts on the programme, Deputy General Manager of the Coconut Cultivation Board, Susantha Jayalath said “I am pleased to have partnered with Nestlé once again on this meaningful initiative to support local coconut farmers. By introducing regenerative agriculture into their practices, we’re not only helping uplift livelihoods but also contributing to a healthier, more sustainable ecosystem. At a time when the Sri Lankan coconut industry faces significant challenges, this training programme offers a much-needed platform for knowledge sharing -empowering farmers to improve their cultivation methods and adopt more sustainable approaches to farming”.
