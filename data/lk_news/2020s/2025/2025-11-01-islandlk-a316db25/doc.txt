Shells that tell a story: Dr. Dinazard Raheem on Sri Lanka’s Ancient and Endangered Snails

At first glance, a snail’s shell might seem like nothing more than a spiral of silence — a tiny relic abandoned on the forest floor. But for Dr. Dinazard Raheem, these delicate coils hold the story of an island’s past, its changing climate, and perhaps even its future.

Addressing the Nations Trust–Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) recent monthly lecture held at the BMICH, Dr. Raheem, one of Sri Lanka’s leading malacologists, took her audience on an extraordinary journey — from the island’s misty montane forests to the fossil beds of ancient continents — tracing the hidden history and fragile survival of land snails.

“Something that is really useful about snails,” she explained, “is that they have this calcium carbonate shell, which remains in the environment long after the animal has died. These shells are incredibly powerful tools — they allow us to detect species even when the live snails aren’t active.”

When the weather dries up, live snails retreat into the soil, vanishing without a trace. But their shells endure, sometimes for decades. “You can still detect the presence of a species in a place simply because you’ve found its shell,” she said, showing slides of shells in various stages of decay — from freshly dead to almost crystalline. “By the time you see that internal structure, the calcium carbonate superstructure, you’re literally looking at the architecture of time.

Land snails, Dr. Raheem explained, are far from humble creatures of the undergrowth. They are evolutionary timekeepers. “Unlike many other animal groups, some land snail families have incredibly rich fossil records,” she noted. “In Sri Lanka, the Cyclophoridians are a great example — a group represented here by living species, but whose fossils go back millions of years.”

Holding up images of Cyclophorus and Tortulosa fossils from northern Vietnam, she pointed out that these ancient shells were dated to 23 million years ago. “And even more astonishing,” she added, “there’s a tiny land snail preserved in amber from the mid-Cretaceous — around 99 million years ago. So when we study snails, we’re looking at life forms that have survived through deep time.”

The patterns of their distribution tell an even grander story — the breakup of Gondwana, the prehistoric supercontinent that once united Africa, South America, Madagascar, India, Sri Lanka, and Australia.

“The Akavadi snails, like Acavus and Oligospira, are classic Gondwanan groups,” said Dr. Raheem. “They’re found only in the southern continents — South America, Africa, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, and Australia. Their distribution reflects a shared ancient history, before these landmasses drifted apart.”

Sri Lanka today harbours 238 described land snail species, an astonishing 90 percent of which are found nowhere else on Earth. “It’s one of the highest levels of endemism in any island fauna,” she said. “For such a small island, that’s remarkable.”

The majority of these species are concentrated in the wet and intermediate zones, particularly in the lowland and montane rainforests. Yet, these are also the areas most at risk from deforestation and climate change.

“The wet zone covers less than 20 percent of the island’s land area — about 13,000 square kilometres — but it contains over 75 percent of our endemic species,” Dr. Raheem explained. “That’s where the richness lies, and it’s also where the threats are greatest.”

She warned that even the so-called “wet” areas are beginning to dry. “Some of the sites I’ve been studying seem to be getting drier,” she told the audience. “People who live near forest patches say the same. What we might be seeing is a slow drying trend — and that has major implications for species distributions.”

Dr. Raheem’s fascination with snails began early — in her school years — and later blossomed into a lifelong pursuit of scientific discovery. While studying at Imperial College, London, she spent Wednesday afternoons in the Mollusca Collections of the Natural History Museum, given a set of keys and full access to the archives.

“I was incredibly lucky,” she recalled. “The Natural History Museum in London holds nearly 80 percent of the type specimens for South Asian snail species — the original reference material used when these species were first described.”

For anyone working on tropical land snails, she said, those historic specimens are the foundation of modern taxonomy. “You can’t know what you’ve found unless you can compare it to the original types,” she explained. “That’s how we set the baseline.”

Her research has also been tied deeply to Sri Lanka. In the 1990s, she returned to the island to take part in a landmark field survey funded by the Darwin Initiative. Over 24 months, her team conducted systematic sampling at more than 250 forest sites across the island — from the southern rainforests to the highlands of Uva.

“It was transformative,” she said. “We generated the first modern distributional maps for many species and established reference collections at the Colombo Museum and the University of Peradeniya. That work showed us just how little we knew — and how much there was still to discover.”

Land snails, she reminded the audience, are not only ancient survivors — they are also modern sentinels of ecological change.

“They’re incredibly sensitive to microclimate — humidity, temperature, and forest structure,” she said. “When those change, snails are often the first to disappear. So by studying them, we can track the health of entire ecosystems.”

She also cautioned about invasive species such as the golden apple snail, which has spread rapidly across the island since the 1990s. “The golden apple snail is an absolute menace,” she warned. “At first, there were just a few colonies, but now it’s everywhere. They can devastate wetlands and paddy fields.”

Still, Dr. Raheem’s talk was as much a celebration as a warning — a reminder that Sri Lanka’s smallest creatures hold some of its largest scientific secrets.

“Snails may not be glamorous,” she said with a smile, “but they tell us extraordinary stories — about the age of our forests, the history of our planet, and the changes that are happening right now, beneath.”
