A 9-year-old girl’s quick thinking and bravery saved the life of a man attempting suicide at the Bandarawela railway station.

The courageous act was carried out by Senuki Hiyara, a student from Bandarawela, whose parents are employed abroad. Senuki and her younger brother live with their grandparents in the town. On Sep 23, while preparing to board the Calypso train to Demodara with her grandmother and brother, Senuki noticed a 42-year-old man attempting to hang himself near the railway tracks.

She first tried to speak to the man, but when he did not respond, she immediately ran to the station master’s office to seek help. Thanks to her timely alert, railway officers rushed to the spot and rescued the man, preventing a tragedy.

The individual, later identified as a former Navy member struggling with mental stress and family disputes, was handed over to the Bandarawela Police for further assistance.

Police confirmed that this was not his first suicide attempt.
