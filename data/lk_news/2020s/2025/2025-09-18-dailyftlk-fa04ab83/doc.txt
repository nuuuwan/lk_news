UNP buries hatchet with breakaway SJB members

The United National Party (UNP) Working Committee, chaired by party Leader and ex-President Ranil Wickremesinghe, yesterday agreed to revoke all disciplinary measures imposed on members who had joined the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) led by Sajith Premadasa.

The decision was made at a Working Committee meeting held on Tuesday evening (16) at the Sirikotha headquarters in Pitakotte.

A committee headed by former Attorney General and Presidentâ€™s Counsel Tilak Marapana was also appointed to examine possible legal implications arising from the move.

UNP Chairman Vajira Abeywardena said the decision removes obstacles that had prevented members who crossed over to the SJB from reuniting with the UNP and working with the party.

The Working Committee further passed a resolution, unanimously, extending gratitude to all parties that had supported collective political efforts since the arrest of ex-President Ranil Wickremesinghe.
