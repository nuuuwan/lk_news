Sri Lanka has regressed in gender equality: UN study

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has regressed in gender equality, a UN study found, with the country dropping 15 places in a global index.

A research conducted by the UN Women programme on gender equality in the country “identified that there has been a regression in gender equality in Sri Lanka in the global context,” a parliament statement said after the key findings and recommendations of the research were presented to the Women Parliamentarians’ Caucus.

“While Sri Lanka was ranked 18th among 115 countries in 2006, it dropped to 130th among 148 countries in 2025.”

“Although some of the most influential individuals in the region are women, significant inequality was identified when compared to men.”

Program representatives said the investigation focused on women’s economic empowerment, women’s leadership in governance and decision-making, women, peace and security, and the prevention of violence against women and girls.

Caucus chair Minister Saroja Paulraj proposed that each ministry allocate funds within their scope to empower women in the preparation of the upcoming budget. (Colombo/Oct2/2025)
