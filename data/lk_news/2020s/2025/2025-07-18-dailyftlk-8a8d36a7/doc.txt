A seminar focused on “Data Protection and Cybersecurity implementation” will be held on 7 August, at the NH Collection in Colombo, under the theme “Safeguarding Trust: Implementing Data Protection and Cybersecurity in a Digital Era”.

The event will feature two dedicated sessions addressing Sri Lanka’s readiness to operationalise the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) and strengthen cybersecurity practices across sectors.
