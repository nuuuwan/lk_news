Sri Lanka 2,000 note circulation delayed by cash machine calibration

ECONOMYNEXT – The new 2,000 rupee note issued by the central bank of Sri Lanka will gradually be released into circulation after banks calibrate their cash-handling machines, CBSL said.

“In order to facilitate the smooth acceptance and dispensation of the new note, Licensed Commercial Banks are in the process of calibrating their cash-handling machines,” CBSL said.

“In keeping with the pace of the process, the new note will gradually be released into circulation through Licensed Commercial Banks.”

The commemorative currency note was issued on August 29 to mark its 75th Anniversary, CBSL said.

“The new currency note will be seamlessly accommodated in all banking channels once the calibration process is concluded.”

The note is the first to bear President Anura Dissanayake’s signature. (Colombo/Sep2025)
