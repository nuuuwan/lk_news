Ex-Moratuwa Mayor remanded till 23 Sept

Former Moratuwa Mayor Samanlal Fernando, who was arrested by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), was yesterday (10) ordered to be remanded until 23 September by Colombo Chief Magistrate Asanga S. Bodaragama.

The arrest was made in connection with the alleged misappropriation of Rs 105 million allocated in 2013 by the Ministry of Ports and Highways to the Moratuwa Municipal Council under the Urbanâ€“Rural Road Development Programme. Investigators told the Court that the funds, meant for community development contracts, were instead awarded to eight contractors known to be close associates of the suspect, causing a financial loss to the State.

CIABOC officials informed the Court that at the time, the council had been directed to either follow the government financial circulars or carry out the projects through direct contracting by the municipal council. Despite this, the suspect had unlawfully intervened, bypassing procedures under the Municipal Council Ordinance and financial regulations, to divert the funds to favoured parties, committing the offence of corruption.

Investigators further stated that statements from several municipal officials were yet to be recorded and argued that releasing the suspect on bail could lead to witness intimidation.

Considering the submissions made by investigators and the Defence Counsel, the Magistrate ordered that the suspect remain in remand until 23 September. The complainant party was also directed to submit a progress report on the investigation on that date.
