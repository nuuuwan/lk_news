Sarrah Sammoon becomes first Lankan to receive prestigious Certification in Investment Migration

Sarrah Sammoon, widely recognised as a pioneer of the global mobility industry in Sri Lanka, has once again made history by becoming the first Sri Lankan to receive the Certification in Investment Migration from the Investment Migration Council (IMC) of Switzerland, the global governing body for the investment migration profession.

With over 30 years of leadership in the field, Sarrah Sammoon is a regulated global mobility specialist and the Founder and CEO of Magellan Champlain. Her firm serves multinational corporations, high-net-worth individuals, and globally mobile families across over 25 destinations. Her latest accomplishment underscores her commitment to professional excellence and responsible advisory practices in a rapidly evolving industry.

“I have always believed that global mobility must be built on trust, transparency, and ethical practice,” said Sammoon. “This certification affirms our continued dedication to offering clients the highest standard of integrity when navigating citizenship and residency options worldwide.”

The Certification in Investment Migration offers in-depth training on ethics, due diligence, anti-money laundering (AML), and best practices in the marketing and processing of Citizenship and Residency by Investment (CBI/RBI) programs.

As the first Sri Lankan to be awarded this prestigious credential, Sammoon sets a new benchmark for professionals in the region and reinforces the importance of regulation and accountability in cross-border advisory services.
