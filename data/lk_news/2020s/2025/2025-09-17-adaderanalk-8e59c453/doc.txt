The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) has announced a nine-hour water cut from 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on tomorrow (18) for several areas in Colombo and suburbs.

In light of this, the NWSDB has urged the public to make prior arrangements and store an adequate supply of water to avoid inconvenience during the period of the suspension.
