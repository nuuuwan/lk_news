Sri Lanka former president likely to face bail hearing via Zoom: Prison spokesman

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s former president Ranil Wickremesinghe is likely to be kept in hospital and face his bail hearing online via Zoom, Prison spokesman Jagath Weerasinghe told a private media channel.

“The doctors’ recommendation is that because he has complications he cannot be produced in court physically,” Weerasinghe told Derana TV.

“Most likely [bo-ho du-ra-ta], if the magistrate orders us, we are prepared to present him via Zoom technology for the hearing.”

Former President Wickremesinghe, who was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of the National hospital is due to appear in Court at 1 pm today.

Wickremesinghe, who is suffering from type 2 diabetes and a heart condition was admitted to hospital on Saturday following complications from dehydration, after a long drawn out questioning, arrest and bail hearing on Friday.

He was arrested over alleged mis-use of public property during a stop-over in London while returning from the UN General Assembly in the US. (Colombo/Aug26/2025)
