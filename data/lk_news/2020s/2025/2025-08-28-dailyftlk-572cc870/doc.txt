Abeysinghe, also acknowledged the challenges facing the gem industry, noting that it remains largely informal and is often hindered by corruption and lack of proper oversight.

“The industry, in its current form, operates through informal associations and is in urgent need of regulations and reforms. Greater transparency and accountability are essential to ensure its long-term sustainability and global competitiveness,” he emphasised.

Mayor of Colombo V.C. Balthazaar commended the initiative for its contribution to both urban development and cultural diplomacy, affirming Colombo’s growing role as a global gem hub. She praised Gem Sri Lanka as a luminous platform that not only showcases the island’s unparalleled gemstone heritage but also strengthens the nation’s standing on the international gem calendar.

Export Development Board Chairman Mangala Wijesinghe stated that the gem industry ranks as the ninth largest export sector in the country, recording an 8% growth last year and projecting a 10% growth this year. The sector has played a major role in foreign remittances, contributing to the overall earnings of $ 697 million, of which $ 332 million came from tourism. He further highlighted that July was an exceptional month for the export sector, while inflation has remained below 5%, creating a positive outlook for the economy.

CGJTA Chairman Rizwan Nayeem delivered a powerful address reflecting on the association’s proud legacy and its ambitious vision for the future.
