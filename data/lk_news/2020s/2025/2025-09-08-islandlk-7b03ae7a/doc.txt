Damn Fine Coffee announces its exclusive distributorship of Oatly in Sri Lanka

Damn Fine Coffee is proud to be the official distributor of Oatly in Sri Lanka. This partnership brings one of the world’s most iconic plant-based coffee innovations into the local market, making it easier for cafés, hotels, and households to meet customer preferences with confidence.

“Around the world, Oatly has become the barista’s choice for plant-based milk. By launching Oatly locally, Damn Fine Coffee ensures that Sri Lanka’s coffee culture keeps pace with global trends, helping partners deliver the same world-class experiences travelers and locals expect.” said Yasas Kodituwakku, CEO at Damn Fine Coffee.

“From day one, our aim is simple: make it easy for any café or hotel to serve a perfect cup of coffee. Oatly Barista Edition is built for espresso service with its great foam, reliable pours, and it helps our partners serve more guests who prefer or need a dairy alternative.”

For cafés and hotels, this collaboration will ensure uninterrupted availability and consistent stock flow for partners and meet consumer demands and preferences for plant-based options. It’s also barista-tested with Oatly built for espresso service — it froths, steams, and pours reliably so staff can serve with confidence. Going beyond, Damn Fine Coffee provides training, menu kits, and field support so every café and hotel can adopt Oatly seamlessly.
