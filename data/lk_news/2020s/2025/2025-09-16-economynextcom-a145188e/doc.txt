Sri Lanka services buoyed by wholesale, retail trade

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s services sector expanded at a slower rate in August 2025, with a Purchasing Managers Index compiled by the central bank registering a value of 68.9, compared to 70.1 in July.

“The expansion was buoyed by strong performance in wholesale and retail trade, other personal services, and accommodation, food and beverage services, which increased amid high tourist arrivals,” the central bank said.

Business activities related to financial services improved, driven by an increase in lending activities, CBSL said.

New Businesses increased due to expansions in wholesale and retail trade, and financial services related activities.

Employment continued to increase in August, reflecting “recruitments in several companies to support ongoing operational requirements.”
