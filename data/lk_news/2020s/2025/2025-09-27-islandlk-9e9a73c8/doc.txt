A hat trick with two late goals by Savain Karunasiri led Royal College under 16 to win Chandi Chanmugam Challenge trophy by 5-1 against their arch rivals St. Thomas’ College Mount Lavinia in the annual hockey encounter played at Colombo International Astro Turf last weekend.

Later Seth Pathirathna added a stylish goal to lead the Reid avenue team with 2-0 at the lemons.

In the second half, the STC bounced back with a reverse stick goal by their skipper Hansa Thilakarathne to reduce the Royal lead to 2-1 before Vidu Wijesinghe scored the third goal for Royal. Karunasiri scored two goals within quick succession in the last seven minutes of the game to secure a 5-1 victory for Royal.

With the win, Royal juniors won the Chandi Chanmugam trophy for the second successive year.
