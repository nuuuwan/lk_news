Tech Cargo Hub hosts strategic industry dialogue

Tech Cargo Hub (TCH), Sri Lanka’s leading digital warehousing and logistics solutions provider, hosted a high-impact industry conference on the 12th of July, to unveil its newest venture; TCH 2, a 20,000 sq. ft. smart warehouse designed to power the future of logistics in the region.

Held at TCH 1, the event brought together industry leaders from freight forwarding, retail, and supply chain tech to discuss a shared challenge: how to digitalize warehousing in a market long reliant on manual processes.

“Digitisation gives us the tools to make an immediate impact, even in small ways,” said Ikraam Reyaz, CEO of SFL Tech — the technology service provider and advisor for TCH — during his keynote.

TCH’s leadership team; including General Manager Fawaaz Jishty, Head of Projects Umar Haroon, and Business Development Lead Husni Uwise, delivered a deep dive into the company’s operational model. They highlighted how TCH simplifies backend complexity for logistics partners by offering true plug-and-play warehousing: digitised inventory control, real-time tracking, cross-docking, pick & pack services, and live analytics, all under one roof.
