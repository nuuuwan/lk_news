Hartal in North and East on Friday, 15 Aug., over military killing

ITAK urges President Disanayake to immediately remove excessive military presence in the two provinces

The Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi (ITAK) has called for a full Hartal in the North and East, condemning the death of a 35-year-old person caused by soldiers in Mullaitivu.

In a letter to President Anura Kumara Disanayake, the ITAK stated that the body of Edirmanasingam Kabilraj was found in the Muttaiyankattu Tank on Saturday (9) morning.

It has now been revealed that on 7 August, five men were asked to come to the 63rd Division camp of the Sri Lanka Army and were severely beaten by the soldiers there. One of them, Kabilraj, had gone missing, and later his body was found floating in the Tank.

“We have come to know that some soldiers have been arrested in this regard. We bring this matter to your Excellency’s urgent attention not only to urge your Excellency to ensure unhindered thorough investigation and for the culprits to be brought to book, but also to highlight the oppressive conduct and excessive presence of the military in the North and the East,” the ITAK letter said.

The party urged the President to take immediate steps to “remove the excessive presence of the military without delay” and also to “ensure the process of justice in this instance is carried out without interference.”

“We have called for a Hartal on Friday, 15 August, in the entirety of the North and East Provinces to protest against the military’s brutality that continues to date,” the letter said.
