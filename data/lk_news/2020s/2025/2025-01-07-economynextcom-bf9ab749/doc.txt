Sri Lanka should not to deport Rohingiya asylum seekers: opposition leader

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka should not deport a group of Rohingya asylum seekers who have arrived recently and such a move would be against the obligation of the country under international conventions, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said.

“We have go to know that there is an attempt by the government to deport them,” Premadasa told Parliament Tuesday.

“I am requesting the government not to make such an inhuman move. Turning them back is a violation of international human rights law.

“The entire world accepts that the Rohingya community is subjected to discrimination and pressures and violence.

“Please follow the policy of non-refoulement. We cannot deport them by force.”

Sri Lanka is bound to act under the Refugee Convention of 1951, and other international conventions, and Lanka should halt any plans to deport them, he said.

Sri Lanka should halt the attempts to deport the refuges and discuss with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and give them the necessary humanitarian support, Premadasa said.

Sri Lanka is still considering the matter taking into account humanitarian aspects, Media Minister Nalinda Jayatissa told a weekly post-cabinet briefing.

Sri Lanka’s Human Rights Commission has sought Presidential intervention to access the refugees, after they were blocked by the military from seeing them.  (Colombo/Jan07/2025)
