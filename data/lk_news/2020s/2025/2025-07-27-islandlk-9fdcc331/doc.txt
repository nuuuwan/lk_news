First Capital maintains constructive outlook on NDB, sees strong growth potential

First Capital Research has reaffirmed its positive stance on National Development Bank (NDB), maintaining a ‘buy’ recommendation despite a slight moderation in short-term expectations. The bank’s strong earnings recovery, declining impairments, and favorable macroeconomic conditions underpin First Capital’s confidence in NDB’s long-term growth trajectory.

NDB reported an impressive 143.6% year-on-year (YoY) earnings growth in 1Q2025, though slightly below expectations due to slower loan expansion. The surge in profitability was largely driven by a sharp reduction in impairment charges. However, quarterly earnings saw a 58.5% contraction compared to 4Q2024, primarily due to a one-off reversal of impairment charges related to International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs).

Net Interest Income (NII) declined 1.3% YoY and 18.6% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) to LKR 8.0 billion, reflecting the impact of Sri Lanka’s low-interest-rate environment. Meanwhile, fee and commission income saw modest growth of 1.6% YoY, underperforming peers due to weaker card-based transactions.

First Capital anticipates a 208.4% YoY surge in recurring net profit to LKR 8.7 billion in 2025E, supported by:

First Capital has revised its 2025E fair value estimate to LKR 170.0 (still implying a 27% upside) while setting a 2026E fair value of LKR 190.0, suggesting 42% growth potential.

First Capital’s verdict on NDB is ‘buy’ for long-term value creation.

“Despite near-term headwinds, NDB remains well-positioned for long-term value creation, backed by strong fundamentals and an improving economic landscape,” the research firm stated.First Capital’s buy recommendation underscores confidence in the bank’s ability to capitalise on growth opportunities ahead.
