SJB condemns Media Minister’s threatening statement

Says in 1988/89, media personalities who went against JVP were answered through bullets

Main Opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) yesterday vehemently condemned the threatening statement made by Health and Media Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa based on a news article published in a national newspaper.

“The Government, which has pledged to protect media freedom, is now exerting pressure on media institutions that overlook the Government’s ideology,” the SJB said in a statement.

During the 1988/89 regime, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) answered to those media personalities – Themis Guruge, Sagarika Gomas, Kulasiri Amaratunga, and Premakeerthi de Alwis – who didn’t follow JVP’s orders through bullets. Although the Media Minister does not reply through bullets, he is putting pressure on the media as usual through threatening statements.

The newspaper, which published news on violation of civilian rights, has done its responsibility as watchdog in the media by reporting an injustice done to a civilian by the Athurugiriya Police. The Media Minister, instead of asking to follow the process of publishing a correction if the news was incorrect, has threatened to suppress those who hold opposite views.

We strongly urge the Media Minister, who is entrusted to protect the rights of the media, to stop this practice immediately.”
