Samson Logistics (Pvt) Ltd (SamsonLines), a subsidiary of DSI Samson Group, in a strategic move to transform into a fully integrated third-party logistics (3PL) provider has appointed Rushdi Zackariya to its Board of Directors, effective immediately. This appointment marks a pivotal step in the company’s long-term vision to expand its service portfolio beyond freight forwarding and establish itself as a comprehensive logistics solutions provider.
