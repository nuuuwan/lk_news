Will history  repeat itself?

Sri Lanka will make their final appearance in the Asia Cup 2025 when they face a strong Indian side today (26) in their last Super Four encounter in Dubai, commencing at 2.30 p.m. (Sri Lanka time).

India sealed their place in the Asia Cup 2025 final with a clinical 41-run win over Bangladesh in Dubai on Wednesday, a result that also knocked Sri Lanka out of contention. In that game, opener Abhishek Sharma once again stole the spotlight with a blistering 37-ball 75, earning him the Player of the Match award.

Led by skipper Suryakumar Yadav, India remain the only unbeaten team of this tournament and are eager to continue their winning momentum. For India, today’s clash with Sri Lanka will serve as a dress rehearsal ahead of Sunday’s final. However, Sri Lanka will be determined to end their campaign on a positive note after suffering back-to-back defeats in the Super Four stage.

Sri Lanka experimented with a 6-4 combination in their last outing against Pakistan, sacrificing a specialist batter for an extra bowler. Chamika Karunaratne came in for Kamil Mishara, but the move backfired as Sri Lanka were restricted to 133 in their 20 overs, a total Pakistan chased down comfortably with five wickets and two overs to spare.

Earlier, Sri Lanka had gone with a 7-4 composition, fielding an extra batter, but still failed to defend their score with the ball. This inconsistency in balance has been a key issue, and once again, the team is expected to reassess its composition ahead of today’s game. Speedster Matheesha Pathirana remains unavailable due to illness, leaving Sri Lanka to rely heavily on their spinners Wanindu Hasaranga and Maheesh Theekshana, while Dushmantha Chameera and Nuwan Thushara handle the seam duties.

In batting, the spotlight will be on openers Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Mendis to provide a strong start, while the middle order which collapsed against Pakistan will need to step up.

India enjoys a commanding 21-9 lead over Sri Lanka in T20 internationals, but their Asia Cup rivalry has been far more competitive, with India holding a slender 12-11 edge. Although out of the final, Sri Lanka has every chance to challenge India strongly.

India’s campaign has underlined their balance across departments. At the top, Abhishek Sharma has been a revelation, piling up 248 runs with two fifties, while Shubman Gill has offered calm stability. In bowling, Kuldeep Yadav leads the tournament with 12 wickets, backed by the spin options of Varun Chakravarthy and Axar Patel, giving India a formidable edge.

The team management has hinted at possible changes to rest key players, though no confirmation was given yesterday. Meanwhile, Pakistan and Bangladesh faced off last night in what was virtually a semi final, with the winner earning the right to meet India in Sunday’s final in Dubai.
