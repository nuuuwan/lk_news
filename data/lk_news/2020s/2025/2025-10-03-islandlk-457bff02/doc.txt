‘Activ8 Asia named a Great Place to Work Again’

Thrilled to announce that Activ8 Asia has been certified as a Great Place to Work® for the second consecutive year. This isn’t about a logo on our wall — it’s about the people who make Activ8 Asia a place where ideas, care and reliability come together every single day.

This achievement belongs to our team. At Activ8 Asia we believe great work comes from great culture: transparent leadership that listens, flexible ways of working that respect life outside the desk, mentorship and cross-team learning that turn curiosity into growth, and everyday rituals — small celebrations, peer recognition, and honest feedback — that build trust. Our people bring energy, creativity and a service-first mindset into everything they do, and that’s what our clients feel in every interaction.

Our BPO service sits at the heart of that promise. From dependable customer support and smooth back-office operations to tailored client solutions, our BPO teams combine technical skill with empathy and consistency. Clients choose Activ8 Asia because our people care — and because our culture supports them to deliver work that’s accurate, timely and human.

“This recognition is for every person at Activ8 Asia,” said the Managing Director of Activ8 Asia. “We build systems and policies, but it’s our people who bring those systems to life. That’s why we celebrate this win, because it reflects how we show up for each other and for our clients, day after day.”

Looking ahead, we’ll keep investing in what matters: developing our people, strengthening wellbeing, and creating even more opportunities for internal growth and client impact. Because when your people thrive, your service does too.
