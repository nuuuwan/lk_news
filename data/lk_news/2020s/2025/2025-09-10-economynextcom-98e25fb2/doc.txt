Sri Lanka parliament passes law to prune president’s privileges

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka parliament passed a law to curtail entitlements of president and past leaders of the country with a majority of 150 votes.

The President’s Entitlement (Repeal) Bill was brought before the Sri Lankan Parliament to abolish the special privileges and lifelong benefits traditionally enjoyed by former presidents.

The bill saw 151 votes in favour of it against a solitary vote.

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s National People’s Power (NPP)-led ruling party promised to prune excess privileges of president and past leaders in its election campaigns.

Under the earlier law, ex-presidents were entitled to state-funded residences, vehicles, staff, security, and other facilities at the taxpayers’ expense, regardless of the country’s economic condition.

The move to repeal these entitlements came against the backdrop of Sri Lanka’s severe financial crisis and growing public anger over political privilege and wasteful expenditure.

By introducing the bill, analysts say, the government aimed to send a strong message about accountability, equality before the law, and the need to cut back on unnecessary state spending while millions of ordinary citizens continued to struggle with rising living costs. (Colombo/September 10/2025)
