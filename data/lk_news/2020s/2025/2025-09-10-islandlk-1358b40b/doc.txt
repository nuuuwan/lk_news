Call for action from Ministry and other authorities

It was, indeed, gratifying to have parents, especially mothers, contacting me and praising The Island for the article ‘Negative impact on schoolchildren; An eye-opener for Women’s & Child Ministry’.

What’s more, even AI (Artificial Intelligence) picked up the article and elaborated on it on AI Mode, and this is what AI created, with the headline ‘Negative impact on schoolchildren; An eye-opener for Women’s & Child Ministry’:

“According to an article in The Island, a Sri Lankan newspaper, the potential negative impacts of child beauty pageants on schoolchildren should be an eye-opener for the country’s Women and Child Ministry. The article highlights concerns over the effects of intense competition on young children, calling for action from the Ministry and other authorities.

‘Negative impact on schoolchildren; An eye-opener for Women’s & Child Ministry’ (The Island, Thursday, 04 September, 2025) highlighted on AI Mode

The article identifies several potential negative effects of child beauty pageants, fuelled by intense competition and pressure to win.

* Mental health issues: Critics argue that the events can contribute to anxiety, depression, and stress.

* Low self-worth: Placing high-value on physical appearance can lead to feelings of low self-worth in young participants.

* Exploitation: The article implicitly raises concerns about potential harm and the need to protect children from exploitation.

The author urges the Women’s and Child Ministry to take immediate action to address these pressing issues, emphasising the following:

* Collaboration: Authorities must work together to ensure the protection and well-being of Sri Lankan schoolchildren.

* Parental vigilance: Parents are reminded that their child’s safety is their responsibility and that they must remain cautious.

* Regulatory focus: The piece mentions a global trend towards stricter regulations and increased awareness regarding the negative impact of such events on children.

The article serves as a call for increased awareness and regulation surrounding child beauty pageants to protect the mental and emotional health of young participants.”

And … since these two letters make interesting reading, I thought of highlighting them, as well:

Mrs. Somasundera: There are parents who put too much pressure on their children to win. Some of these kids hate doing pageants and are scared to go on stage, but the mothers force them out there, anyway. Obviously, these pageant mothers are more concerned about themselves than they are about their child’s happiness. They’re not entering pageants for the kids—they’re doing it for themselves.

Mrs. Gamage: I do not support pageants for school-goers and I would never put my child in one. In my honest opinion, pageants for school-goers, and also modelling, are harmful to children.
