Sri Lanka president tells USTR: minor shocks could have major impact

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka President Anura Kumara Dissanayake told senior officials from the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) that even minor external shocks could have a considerable impact on the country.

The President met the USTR officials along with the U.S. Ambassador Julie Chung and discussed potential trade agreements expected to be developed between the two countries in the future, the President’s Media Division (PMD) said.

The meeting took place at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo on Thursday.

“The President, noting that Sri Lanka is a small economy in recovery, emphasised that even minor external shocks could have a considerable impact on the nation,” the PMD said in a statement.

“He pointed out that in moving forward with trade negotiations, all such factors should be taken into account. He further underlined the importance of ensuring that every decision made should focus on strengthening the long-term bilateral relationship between Sri Lanka and the United States.”

The USTR delegation included Emily Ashby, Director for South Asia; Brendan Lynch, Assistant USTR for South and Central Asia; Daniel Jackson, Economic and Commercial Officer of the U.S. Embassy in Colombo; and Anthony Pirnot, Political and Economic Counsellor. (Colombo/September 11/2025)
