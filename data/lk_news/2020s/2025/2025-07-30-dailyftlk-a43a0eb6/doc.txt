Thisakutti Arachchi extends unconditional apology to President over defamatory remarks

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) former MP Thisakutti Arachchi yesterday tendered his unconditional apology over an alleged defamatory statement he had made referring to the National People’s Power (NPP) and President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in 2023.

Disanayake had filed this lawsuit before the Colombo District Court claiming Rs. 10 billion as damages from Kuttiarachchi for allegedly making defamatory statements.

During a public meeting held in Colombo on 19 August 2023, former MP Arachchi had allegedly made remarks against the NPP over its alleged investments in the island nation of Malta.

Disanayake alleged that the defamatory and baseless allegations made against him by Arachchi had been telecast over television news on 19 August 2023, without verifying the truthfulness of the statements.

When the matter was called before the Colombo District Court, the case was withdrawn by the plaintiff following the defendant’s unconditional apology.
