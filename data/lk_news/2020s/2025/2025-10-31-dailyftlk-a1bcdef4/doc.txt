Morari Bapu’s Ram Yatra moves from India to Sri Lanka: Retracing Ram’s sacred footsteps across sea

A historic Ram Yatra led by spiritual leader Morari Bapu, which is currently underway, soon enters a momentous and deeply symbolic chapter as it crosses from India into Sri Lanka—the land once ruled by Ravana, where Lord Ram’s quest to rescue Mata Sita reached its divine culmination. The upcoming Katha in Negombo marks a profound continuation of this spiritual retracing, as Bapu narrates the Ramayana on the very soil that witnessed the final chapters of the epic’s eternal message of dharma, compassion, and triumph of truth.

Talaimannar marks the first landfall of Lord Ram and his vanara army after crossing the ocean via Ram Setu, the threshold of Lanka for Sita’s rescue. Across Sri Lanka, sites like Sita Eliya, Ravana Ella, and Hanuman Kanda mark the journey of search, captivity, and the final war between Lord Ram and Ravana.

Continuing the sacred trail of Maryada Purushottam Shri Ram’s divine journey, this Katha in Sri Lanka holds profound spiritual significance. It marks the land where dharma triumphed over adharma, where devotion overcame despair, and where humanity witnessed the eternal victory of truth and righteousness.

In a deeply symbolic gesture, devotees accompanying Bapu will travel together via chartered flights from India to Sri Lanka, retracing the divine path of Lord Ram’s crossing to Lanka. The Ram Katha will be held in an open pandal in Negombo, welcoming devotees and spiritual seekers from Sri Lanka and around the world to participate in this once-in-a-lifetime moment of collective faith and cultural harmony.

This Sri Lanka chapter forms a key part of the ongoing Ram Yatra, a monumental pilgrimage covering over 8,000 kilometres across India and Sri Lanka, tracing the sacred path of Lord Ram’s exile, journey to Lanka, and return to Ayodhya. The 11-day Yatra is taking over 400 devotees through a unique spiritual journey that began by train across India and continues by air to Sri Lanka—culminating in the final Ram Katha in Ayodhya.

This is Bapu’s second parikrama yatra related to Lord Ram’s vanvaas (exile); the first took place in 2021 from Ayodhya to Chitrakoot and Nandigram.

It is important to note that Bapu does not accept any payment for conducting Katha; the discourses, as well as the meals served, are completely free of charge.

This epic Yatra is being organised by Bapu’s flower (follower) Madan ji Paliwal of Santkripa Sanatana Sansthan. From the travel to the arrangements and the katha reflect the purity and inclusiveness of Sanatana Dharma. Devotees are accompanying Bapu, making this a collective offering of faith and unity.

Rooted in the eternal values of Satya (Truth), Prem (Love), and Karuna (Compassion), the Ram Yatra reaffirms Bapu’s lifelong mission to spread the light of the Ram Charita Manas and strengthen the spiritual fabric of humanity.
