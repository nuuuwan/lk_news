Sri Lanka Climate Fund ‘well on track to achieve Rs 51 million annual income target’

Sri Lanka’s leading exporters are accelerating their climate compliance efforts as global markets tighten environmental regulations, with the Sri Lanka Climate Fund (SLCF) reporting its strongest surge yet in greenhouse gas verification, carbon credit certification and sustainability advisory services.

Official data from the Ministry of Environment shows that SLCF generated Rs. 38.29 million as of October 31, 2025—well on track to achieve its Rs. 51.6 million annual target, signaling growing private-sector recognition that climate reporting is no longer voluntary but an economic imperative.

Harshani Abeyrathne, Acting Chief Executive Officer of the Climate Change Secretariat highlighted urgency for accelerated compliance across industries.

“Sri Lankan exporters cannot afford to lag behind. International buyers now expect scientifically verified emissions data and credible decarbonisation plans. Without these, our exporters risk losing access to key markets, Abeyrathne warned.

She emphasised that SLCF’s verification and certification mechanisms are critical national tools for companies navigating new climate disclosure rules emerging across Europe, North America and parts of Asia.

“The global shift toward low-carbon supply chains is irreversible. Companies that embrace this transition will gain competitiveness; those that delay will face escalating financial risks, she added.

SLCF completed 90 greenhouse gas verification projects, earning Rs. 27.96 million—a year marked by unprecedented demand from apparel exporters, plantation companies, banks, manufacturers and logistics firms.

A senior SLCF official added: “This is now part of the cost of doing business. Firms tied to European and North American value chains must demonstrate compliance or risk exclusion.”

Major corporates—Dilmah Tea, LOLC Holdings, HNB, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, Cargills, Maliban, Talawakelle Plantations, Kelani Valley Plantations and leading exporters—have already undergone SLCF verification this year.

According to the Climate Change Secretariat, the trend will accelerate as major buyers invoke climate-related procurement requirements.

Sri Lanka’s national carbon crediting mechanism, the Sri Lanka Carbon Crediting Scheme (SLCCS), recorded strong progress, with validation and verification projects generating over Rs. 2.1 million.

SLCF officials said companies are increasingly recognising the financial potential of carbon credits.

“Carbon credits are becoming a mainstream financial instrument. We are seeing renewed interest from renewable energy, plantation, and industrial sectors pushing projects for 2026, an SLCF expert said.

Water footprint verification brought in nearly Rs. 1 million, while climate advisory, SBTi guidance, project management and compliance documentation added Rs. 4.6 million.

The Ministry of Environment stressed that Sri Lanka’s commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 under the UNFCCC means the entire economy must align with scientifically credible decarbonisation pathways.

“This is not an environmental luxury. It is fundamental to maintaining export competitiveness and ensuring Sri Lanka is not penalised under emerging carbon border adjustment mechanisms.”

SLCF expects revenue to jump to Rs. 62.3 million in 2026, backed by expanded GHG verification, carbon crediting, climate-positive certification, Net Zero Energy programmes, and increased private-sector consultancy demand.
