Sri Lanka’s COYLE to get Japanese HR know-how from JETRO

ECONOMYNEXT – The Chamber of Lankan Entrepreneurs (COYLE) and the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to strengthen collaboration and foster workplace well-being.

The MoU outlines a joint framework for knowledge exchange, benchmarking, and shared learning, drawing on Japan’s expertise in human resource management and health-oriented workplace innovation.

“By collaborating with JETRO, COYLE aims to bring international best practices to Sri Lankan enterprises while creating opportunities for deeper bilateral engagement in economic and social spheres,” COYLE said in a statement.

The partnership is aimed at fostering mutual development and promoting a culture of “Health and Productivity Management” across Sri Lanka’s corporate sector.

At part of this the Sri Lanka Corporate Health & Productivity Awards (SLCHPA) will be expanded.

The awards are now backed by JETRO, and aim to be a national benchmark for corporate wellness and responsible business leadership. (Colombo/Jul31/2025)
