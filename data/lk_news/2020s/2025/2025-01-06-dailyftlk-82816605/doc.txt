Justice Preethi Padman Surasena appointed to JSC

Supreme Court Justice Preethi Padman Surasena has been appointed as a member of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC).

The appointment was made by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake with the approval of the Constitutional Council.

Justice Surasena, one of the senior-most judges of the Supreme Court, fills the vacancy created by the retirement of former Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya. The JSC plays a crucial role in ensuring the independence and accountability of the judiciary in Sri Lanka.

This development follows the recent appointment of Chief Justice Murdu Fernando as the Chairman of the JSC, succeeding retired Chief Justice Jayasuriya.
