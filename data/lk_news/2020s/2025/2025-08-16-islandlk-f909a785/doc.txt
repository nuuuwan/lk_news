Chinese Dragon Café opens flagship outlet in Jaffna

Chinese Dragon Café (CDC), one of Sri Lanka’s most recognisable names in Chinese cuisine, has opened its latest outlet in Jaffna, marking a new chapter in the restaurant’s long-standing presence across the island. Located at No. 229, Point Pedro Road, just 900 metres from the historic Nallur Kovil, this new branch becomes the ninth outlet in the country. Established in 1942 by a Chinese couple in Bambalapitiya, CDC has grown steadily over the decades, expanding from a single neighbourhood restaurant into a familiar brand with a presence in key urban areas including Mt. Lavinia, Rajagiriya, Nawala, and Nugegoda. In 2021, the café made its first move overseas with an outlet in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.

“We’ve had many loyal customers from the Northern Province, and opening in Jaffna was a much-needed step. We’re excited to serve the community there.” In recent years, CDC has also taken steps to support sustainability and local agriculture. Projects include sourcing rice from Basmati fields cultivated in partnership with farming communities and reviving mushroom farming in Kegalle. Its bottled chili paste has also become a household staple and is now sold in supermarkets countrywide.
