India to pay 25-pct tariff plus Russia penalty Trump says as Sri Lanka awaits decision

ECONOMYNEXT – India will pay 25 percent tariff plus an unspecified penalty from August 01, for buying oil and military hardware from Russia, President Trump said in a social media post as Sri Lanka awaits a revision of its 30 percent tariff.

“Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country,” Trump said in a posts on his truthsocial.com.

“Also, they have always bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia, and are Russia’s largest buyer of ENERGY, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to stop the killing in Ukraine – al things not good

India will therefore be paying a tariff of 25%, plus a penalty for the above, starting on August first.,

A few minutes later he made another post saying “We have a massive trade deficit with India.”

Sri Lanka is awaiting a reduction on the Trump tariff with several rounds of talks after an initial reduction of the Trump tariff from 44 to 30 percent. (Corrected – Trump second post – A few minutes later he made another post saying “We have a massive trade deficit with India.” Colombo/July30/2025)
