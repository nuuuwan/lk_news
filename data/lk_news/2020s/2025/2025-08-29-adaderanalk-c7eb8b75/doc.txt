Madushanka’s last-over hat-trick powers Sri Lanka to a thriller win

Sri Lankan left-arm seamer Dilshan Madushanka produced a sensational last-over hat-trick to snatch victory from Zimbabwe in a dramatic ODI clash, sealing a 7-run win in Hambantota.

With Zimbabwe needing just 10 runs off the final 6 balls, Madushanka dismissed Sikandar Raza, Brad Evans, and Richard Ngarava in consecutive deliveries to complete his magical treble and break Zimbabwean hearts.

Batting first, Sri Lanka posted a competitive 298 for 6 in their 50 overs. The innings was built on a steady foundation laid by Pathum Nissanka, who scored a fluent 76 off 92 balls with twelve boundaries.

He was supported by contributions from Kusal Mendis (38) and Sadeera Samarawickrama (35) through the middle overs.

The real acceleration, however, came in the final phase when Janith Liyanage struck an unbeaten 70 off just 47 balls, and Kamindu Mendis added a blistering 57 off 36, lifting Sri Lanka close to the 300-mark.

Zimbabwe’s bowlers had their moments, with Richard Ngarava (2/34) impressing with the new ball, while Sikandar Raza and Sean Williams kept things in check during the middle period.

In reply, Zimbabwe’s chase got off to a nightmare start as they slipped to 0 for 2 within the first over, losing Brian Bennett and Brendan Taylor for ducks. However, Ben Curran (70 off 90) steadied the innings, and captain Sean Williams (57 off 54) counter-attacked to bring the visitors back into the contest.

The real spark came from Sikandar Raza, who played a masterful innings of 92 from 87 deliveries, keeping Zimbabwe’s hopes alive and carrying the chase deep into the final overs.

Alongside Tony Munyonga (43 not out), Raza took Zimbabwe within touching distance of a memorable victory.

The climax arrived in the final over, with Zimbabwe needing ten runs to win. On the very first ball, Madushanka knocked over Raza’s stumps to end a magnificent innings.

The next ball saw Brad Evans sky a catch to the deep, before Madushanka completed his hat-trick by producing a searing yorker to dismiss Richard Ngarava. The packed Hambantota crowd erupted as Sri Lanka sealed a thrilling win, with Zimbabwe finishing on 291 for 8 after 50 overs.

Madushanka finished with figures of 4 for 62, headlining Sri Lanka’s bowling effort. He was well supported by Asitha Fernando, who claimed 3 for 50 with the new ball to destabilize Zimbabwe early, while Dushmantha Chameera maintained pressure through tight lines and lengths.

Despite Raza’s heroics, Zimbabwe fell agonizingly short, undone by Madushanka’s brilliance in the final over.
