Israeli airstrikes in Yemen kill at least nine people, Houthis say

At least nine people were killed and more than 100 wounded in Israeli airstrikes on Yemen on Wednesday, the Houthi movement said.

The Houthi-run health authority described the toll as preliminary, saying strikes hit both the capital, Sana’a, and Al-Jawf province.

Residents said casualties in the capital resulted from bombing that targeted the Ministry of Defence’s Moral Guidance headquarters in the capital’s Al-Tahrir neighbourhood, a densely populated area where old houses were damaged by the blasts.
