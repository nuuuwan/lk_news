Malaysia’s hospitality excellence: A blueprint for Sri Lanka?

As a Sri Lankan journalist exploring Malaysia’s vibrant tourism landscape – from the futuristic city of Putrajaya to the historic charm of Melaka and the bustling energy of Kuala Lumpur – I was struck not only by the country’s attractions but also by something deeper: the exceptional service culture in its star-class hotels.

Staying at properties such as Pulse Grande, Birkin International Hotel, Ramada, and Ion Majestic, I witnessed firsthand how Malaysia’s hospitality sector has mastered the art of guest satisfaction, employee empowerment as well as employee satisfaction.

“The courteous, attentive, and highly professional service is no accident. It results from world-class training, capacity building, and teamwork,” Simon Tan, General Manager of Birkin International Hotel in Melaka, told The Island Financial Review.

Wan Mohd Hadafy Bin Wan Mohd Khair, General Manager of Pulse Grande Hotel in Putrajaya, elaborated: “Malaysia’s hotel industry draws inspiration from global best practices while infusing local warmth. Many staff undergo rigorous training programmes, often benchmarked against international chains like Marriott, Hilton, and Shangri-La.”

When I noted how seamlessly Malaysian staff blend professional training with genuine hospitality – never appearing disengaged – he added: “Many guests commend this trait. Humility, respect, and courtesy are innate qualities in our staff, making training even more effective.”

Employee training & teamwork – Regular workshops on service excellence, conflict resolution, and cultural sensitivity ensure equitable respect for all guests.

Proactive service – Staff anticipate needs with politeness and presence of mind.

Employee empowerment – Valued employees deliver exceptional service as a positive feedback loop has been created.

A fellow Sri Lankan guest at Pulse Grande shared his observations: “Sri Lanka’s hotels, renowned for their scenic beauty and heritage, could benefit from Malaysia’s systematic approach to human resource development. While Sri Lankan hospitality is naturally warm, structured training, performance incentives, and guest feedback mechanisms could elevate the experience further.”

He added: “Malaysia’s success proves that investing in employees translates to guest satisfaction. Sri Lankan hotels should explore partnerships with Malaysian hospitality institutes or etiquette trainers in hospitality to foster higher value of their human resource.”

Malaysia’s hotels don’t just accommodate guests – they delight them. Their secret? A relentless focus on both employees and visitors. For Sri Lanka, a country equally rich in culture and natural beauty, adopting similar strategic training and human-centric dynamics could be the key to competing globally.

As I departed Malaysia, I carried back not just memories of stunning skylines and UNESCO heritage sites but also inspiration – a vision of what Sri Lanka’s hospitality sector could aspire to become.

Wouldn’t it be remarkable if Sri Lankan hotel staff set the next benchmark for excellence in South Asia?

The Sri Lankan guest I met at Pulse Grande had booked SriLankan Airlines for his family trip to Malaysia, which he said was his favourite airline. According to Sharuka Wickrama Adittiya, Manager for Malaysia at SriLankan Airlines, a total of 3,171 passengers traveled from Sri Lanka to Malaysia in May 2025, with SriLankan Airlines carrying 1,830 of them. Meanwhile, 5,652 passengers traveled from Malaysia to Sri Lanka in the same month, of which SriLankan Airlines carried 2,311.
