Dubai’s Progressive House Revolution

In Dubai’s dazzling nightlife scene, where mainstream electronic dance music (EDM) often dominates, Sound of Harmonies (SOH Records) has carved out a bold new path for Progressive House – a subgenre of house music, originating in the UK in the early 1990s.

Founded in January 2025 by Sri Lankans Halishan (Tuan Sabreen) and Alex – T (Alick Wiratunga) SOH is more than just a record label. It is a cultural movement redefining how the Middle East contributes to the global underground scene.

One of the label’s defining milestones came with the release of Avantime UK’s debut EP ‘Dusk and Dawn’ on Sound of Harmonies Records, in early 2025.

This massive release captured worldwide attention, supported by legends in the underground music scenario, including Hernán Cattáneo, Subandrio, and Nick Warren.

The EP also achieved the distinction of being featured twice in the Balance Croatia mix series (the mixes showcase a variety of progressive house and electronica artistes) — a testament to its quality and international impact.

SOH’s momentum doesn’t stop there. The label has become a hub for global talent, showcasing artistes such as Dylan Deck, Kohan, Control Illusion, Randle, Frezz, Carbo Nate, DEGG (MT), SHYRO, AÍRWAVÉ (DJ and producer from Kandy), Rob Hilgen, and DJ Leoni. Each brings their own sonic identity, but all share a common thread: deep, authentic Progressive House that resonates beyond borders.

What sets SOH apart is its mission to put Dubai on the global Progressive House map. For too long, the UAE has been associated with luxury-driven festivals and commercial sounds. SOH is rewriting that story, proving that underground music culture can thrive in the region. By joining Proton’s respected global platform, the label ensures every release travels far beyond the Middle East, reaching fans in Europe, South America, Asia, and beyond.

Sound of Harmonies is not just a label, it’s a movement. With its growing roster, visionary founders, and a commitment to authentic sound, SOH is building the foundations for events, collaborations, and showcases that will strengthen its position as a global force in Progressive House.

From Avantime’s landmark EP to a roster filled with innovators, Sound of Harmonies has established itself as a symbol of authenticity and ambition.

For Dubai, it represents progress. For the global scene, it’s a new epicenter. And for music lovers everywhere, it proves that underground harmony is alive, thriving, and ready to lead the future of sound.

Overall, Sound of Harmonies is making waves in the electronic music scene with its unique sound and talented roster of artistes.
