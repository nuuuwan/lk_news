The Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, has been awarded a prestigious “A” grade in Global Finance’s 2025 Central Banker Report Card.

This top-tier recognition places Dr. Weerasinghe among the elite central bank governors worldwide, acknowledging his exceptional leadership and strategic acumen in steering Sri Lanka’s economy through turbulent times.

The Central Banker Report Card, published annually by Global Finance since 1994, grades the central bank governors of nearly 100 key countries, territories, and districts, as well as the European Union, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, the Bank of Central African States, and the Central Bank of West African States.

Grades are based on an “A+” to “F” scale for success in areas such as inflation control, economic growth goals, currency stability, interest rate management, and political independence. (“A” represents excellent performance, down through “F” for outright failure.)
