Neelan: Unsilenced – Documentary On Neelan Tiruchelvam Released

The release of this documentary comes at a critical juncture in Sri Lanka’s political history. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the National People’s Power (NPP) hold an extraordinary parliamentary supermajority. This rare political opportunity provides the platform to enact long-overdue constitutional reforms—reforms that Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam envisioned nearly three decades ago as essential to redressing the grievances of Sri Lanka’s minority communities.

Yet, despite the scope of the NPP’s electoral mandate, meaningful steps toward constitutional reform have been disappointingly absent. It is my sincere hope that this documentary will serve as both an urgent call to action and a source of inspiration—encouraging the Sri Lankan public to hold President Dissanayake accountable to his promises and to advocate for Dr. Tiruchelvam’s vision of a just and inclusive constitution.

In addition to examining Dr. Tiruchelvam’s far-reaching proposals for power-sharing and minority rights in Sri Lanka, the documentary also features interviews conducted with people who discuss his international contributions—most notably Dr. Tiruchelvam’s role in monitoring Chile’s 1988 plebiscite that helped end Pinochet’s dictatorship, and Dr. Tiruchelvam’s role in shaping Kazakhstan’s post-independence constitution. These segments highlight how Neelan’s constitutional thinking and moral vision transcended national borders and helped shape democratic transitions in various parts of the world.

The two-hour documentary concludes with a poignant and beautiful elegy by the acclaimed Sri Lankan-Tamil poet Indran Amirthanayagam.
