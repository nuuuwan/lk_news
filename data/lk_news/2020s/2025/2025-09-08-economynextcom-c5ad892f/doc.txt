Japan helps Sri Lanka hospitals manage waste, with equipment and 5S

ECONOMYNEXT – Japan is providing equipment to manage infectious waste at 15 hospitals across Sri Lanka, along with training, including on 5S and Kaizen concepts, the Japanese embassy in Colombo said.

Under this project, medical waste incinerators with temperature control and exhaust gas treatment systems are being provided to 15 hospitals across all 9 provinces of Sri Lanka.

Together with technical training on proper waste management and equipment operation, the project aims to strengthen infection prevention and control capacity nationwide.

The equipment was provided under a project for which the exchange of notes was signed in April 2023 with a grant assistance of JPY 503 million from Japan, the embassy said in a statement.

Japanese ambassador Akio Isomata attended the handover ceremony at Trincomalee General Hospital, with Minister of Health Nalinda Jayathissa, and Chief Representative of Sri Lanka Office Kenji Kuronuma.

The project strengthens healthcare workers’ capacity through Kaizen, 5S and TQM methods training, ambassador Isomata was quoted as saying.

For bilateral cooperation to be sustainable, he added, private sector partnership should be promoted in medical and related industrial areas.

The project’s capacity development component includes Training of Trainers (ToT), utilizing nudge theory based on modern behavioral sciences, the embassy said.

“Using this ToT approach, the knowledge learnt cascades from Health Ministry officials to hospital infection control officers, and on to broader groups of medical service personnel, thus effectively creating safer medical environment on a wider basis.”
