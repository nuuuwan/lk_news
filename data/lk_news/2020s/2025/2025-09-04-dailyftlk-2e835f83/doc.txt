Ex-Police Chief Pujith discharged from assault case

Operator allegedly assaulted for working elevator during national anthem and meditation program in 2017

Former Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara was yesterday discharged from a case relating to an alleged assault on an elevator operator at Police Headquarters in 2017.

The Fort Magistrateâ€™s Court released him when the matter was taken up for hearing.

The complaint was first made on 2 June 2019, to the then Acting IGP.

The lift operator alleged that on 11 April 2017, Jayasundara verbally abused him, grabbed him by the collar, and attempted to assault him inside an elevator.

According to the complaint, the incident occurred after Jayasundara had directed that the elevator should not be operated during the national anthem and meditation program held at Police Headquarters at the time.
