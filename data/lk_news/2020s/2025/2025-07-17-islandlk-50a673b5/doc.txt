Thought Adani was out of Sri Lanka’s energy landscape? Think again

In a stunning revelation, Minister of Energy, Engineer Kumara Jayakody admitted on 16 July 2025 that the government must refund – not compensate Adani for costs incurred for the scrapped renewable energy deal, while dropping a bombshell: Adani is still very much ‘in the gamut.’

Despite loud claims of distancing itself from the Indian conglomerate, the government now confirms it is working “closely” with Adani, as the company has already made bids for the 100MW Wind Power Project in Mullikulam.

The minister’s surprising admission underscored the government’s continued ties with Adani.

These revelations were made at the 7th Meeting of the International Solar Alliance (ISA), a global intergovernmental organization dedicated to advancing solar power adoption for a carbon-neutral future. The ISA, a collaborative initiative between India and France, was conceptualized during COP21 in Paris in 2015 to unite efforts in combating climate change through solar energy solutions.

Responding to media questions, the minister stated that the government was engaging with Adani in line with its public mandate.

“We determined that wind power rates offered by Adani earlier were too high, and when we relayed this to the Indian conglomerate, they ‘warmly’ accepted our view and withdrew. As per the agreement, we need to refund their refundable deposit. That is not compensation, as some media outlets have misrepresented. Adani remains part of our potential renewables projects – they are very much involved and may even bid for the 100MW Wind Power Project in Mullikulam,” he said.

Addressing another query, the minister highlighted challenges in grid stabilization due to excess solar supply.

“On Sundays and holidays, demand drops to 710 MW, while rooftop solar supply exceeds 1,400 MW. We need advanced power management systems to integrate and distribute this surplus efficiently. Regional partnerships will be crucial to adopting cutting-edge technology and attracting investments to optimize our load profile,” he explained.

Ashish Khanna, Director General of the ISA, who chaired the meeting, brings over 26 years of experience in energy sector development across 15+ countries, spanning project conceptualization, financing, and implementation.

He emphasized the ISA’s role in supporting Sri Lanka and similar nations:

“Consumers with rooftop solar and batteries will transition from mere users to producers in the future. Just as you trade stocks via apps today, you’ll soon trade electricity with multiple buyers. The regional power sector is evolving in this direction,” Khanna noted.
