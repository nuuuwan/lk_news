Route permits  the root cause

Buses form the backbone of public transport system. There was a time when citizen Perera looked favourably upon the state-owned bus service (SLTB. They entertained equal intensity of frown upon private buses. The issuing of individual route permits during the tenure of the late President J. R. Jayewardene opened the floodgates to an uncontrollable private bus industry. This gradually turned from unfriendly to an outright curse. Today, no ordinary citizen sees any good in the private bus service. This is the best time either to turn back or to chart a new course.

Perhaps the Government cannot turn the clock back to the time before the open economy ushered in private buses. It may be possible, but it would be no easy task. The ideal bus service existed prior to the 1958 takeover by the government. At that time, private companies operated the entire public transport system without issuing individual route permits. Permits were held by companies, not by bus owners.

The Ceylon Transport Board (then CTB, now SLTB) became the main state-run operator, though cracks began to appear by the 1970s. In the late 1970s, the government began loosening the state monopoly, paving the way for the gradual entry of private bus operators and the emergence of a mixed competition model.

In the 1980s, the bus industry shifted from a state-controlled system to a hybrid one, with a rising tide of private operators. This transition, driven by mismanagement and mounting losses within the CTB, saw private companies enter the field. Worse, the local bus body-building facilities were abandoned in favour of Indian imports.

At present, the National Transport Commission (NTC) is the primary authority responsible for issuing and regulating passenger service permits for bus routes, commonly known as route permits. A route permit confers the legal right to operate a bus service on a designated route. These permits fall under the Private Omnibus Services Act, No. 44 of 1983, and its subsequent regulations, which are intended to ensure passenger safety, comfort, and proper ticketing. Permit holders are required to meet conditions such as maintaining buses to standard, ensuring staff conduct is acceptable, and providing passenger safeguards such as issuing tickets and carrying fire extinguishers. In theory, the system is designed to maintain quality and stability within the public bus service.

In practice, however, not a single permit holder abides by the rules and regulations laid down by the NTC. Plus, the NTC itself does little to enforce them. The end result is that the commuters are harassed daily, and in some cases, even lose their lives. The need of the hour is to overturn this anti-social public transport culture with private buses standing out as its main culprit.

The only way to rid the country of this toxic bus culture is by establishing provincial or district-level private bus companies, each with an exclusive mandate to operate services within its area. Existing private bus owners could then become shareholders of these companies, while the companies themselves would assume full responsibility for running services. Route permits would be granted only to companies—not to individuals. That would put an end to the  endless problems linked to the issuing of individual permits. This is, in fact, the model followed across the world.

Once private bus companies are in place, they would decide on standards of operation: from crew uniforms and codes of conduct to what music is played on board and at what volume. This would pave the way for a more disciplined, efficient, and passenger-friendly service.

That said, no system can succeed without proper oversight. A practical monitoring mechanism is essential to ensure that all private operators comply with the regulations set by their respective companies. Without such monitoring, nothing will change. The Sri Lankans, with their ingenious ways of bending the rules, will always find loopholes to exploit.

Since the government cannot be expected to run all public services single-handedly, a private–public partnership is essential. Establishing private bus companies would be the most effective option, particularly when it comes to addressing sudden disruptions such as lightning strikes and similar challenges. The comnuters will receive a far better service if the practice of issuing individual or private route permits is abolished, and instead, permits are granted solely to private bus companies.

Each company would hold route permits covering all routes within its designated area, meaning every bus in that region would be authorised to operate on any route. Private bus owners would become shareholders of these companies, giving them both a stake and a responsibility in the system.

The NTC, for its part, could be redefined with a new role as the state body overseeing and coordinating Sri Lanka’s public transport services, ensuring stability, accountability, and fairness across the board.
