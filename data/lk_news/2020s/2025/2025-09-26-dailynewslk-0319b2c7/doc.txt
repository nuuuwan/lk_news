Maliban Biscuits book their spot in MCA Knockout Final

National right-arm leg spinner Dushan Hemantha produced a sensational spell of 8 for 29 as Maliban Biscuits cruised into the final of the MCA Super Premier League Knockout Tournament with an eight-wicket win over Fairfirst Insurance in the semi-final played at NCC Grounds on Wednesday.

Fairfirst Insurance, sent in to bat, started positively at 89 for 2 but quickly lost momentum against Hemantha’s brilliant spell, crashing to 130 all out in 32.4 overs. His figures stand as the best bowling performance of this tournament.

Chasing 131, Maliban Biscuits made light work of the target, reaching 134 for 2 in just 25.2 overs. Openers Hiran Jayasundera (57 not out) and Sangeeth Cooray (57) put on a commanding stand of 108 runs off 118 balls to seal the victory.
