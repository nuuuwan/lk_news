Ministry of Power to review Adani energy solutions in Sri Lanka

The Ministry of Power and Energy has decided to appoint a committee to review the study of the Adani Group’s energy projects in Sri Lanka. The relevant proposal will be presented to the upcoming Cabinet meeting.

The Ministry said that the committee would review factors including estimated costs for the projects. Previously, a committee appointed by the ministry examined the wind power plant projects planned by the Adani Group in Sri Lanka.

The wind power projects proposed for Mannar and Pooneryn are expected to generate a total of 484 megawatts of electricity.

Sri Lanka, which suffered from crippling power blackouts and fuel shortages during an economic crisis in 2022, has enacted a new legislation to revamp the country’s power sector and attract investment in renewable energy.

The move, which is in line with the commitments made under a USD 2.9 billion aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), seeks to reduce losses in the state-run power company Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and make the sector more appealing to investors.
