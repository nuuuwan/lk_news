Transport Minister warns underperforming railway officials: ‘Fix it or resign’

Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation Bimal Rathnayake has issued a stern warning to officials attached to Sri Lanka Railways, stating that those who fail to ensure the proper functioning and maintenance of railway services should be prepared to step down.

Speaking at a discussion held at the Kalutara District Secretariat with Members of Parliament and transport sector officials, Minister Rathnayake criticized the poor condition of train compartments, highlighting issues such as broken windows, non-functional fans and unsanitary washrooms, especially on key office trains such as those operating between Galle and Colombo.

He also referenced a tragic incident where a young boy lost two fingers after falling against a faulty window during his first train ride.

‘These trains are meant for working people. How can we justify such poor service? Within a month, I want to see clear repairs—washrooms, windows, fans. And in three days, send me a WhatsApp message telling me what you’re going to do. If you can’t provide a basic service, then leave. This is the final warning. I’m seriously fed up,’ the Minister said.
