Sajith seeks time to file assets in digital format

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa has written to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) requesting additional time to submit his assets and liabilities declaration in digital form.

Samagi Jana Balawegaya Gampaha District Organiser Waruna Deepatha Rajapaksa told reporters that Premadasa had already lodged his assets and liabilities statement with the Secretary General of Parliament on 23 April. The Secretary General Kushani Rohanadeera, subsequently forwarded the documents to CIABOC.

According to Rajapaksa, the Commission later asked that the declaration be resubmitted in digital format so it could be published on its website. In response, Premadasa sent a letter on 10 September seeking time to provide the information electronically.

“Premadasa will declare his assets and liabilities in a digital format before long,” Rajapaksa said.
