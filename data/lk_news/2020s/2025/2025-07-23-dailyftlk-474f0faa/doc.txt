Parliament postpones debate on Electricity (Amendment) Bill

The Committee on Parliamentary Business has decided not to proceed with the scheduled debate on the Sri Lanka Electricity (Amendment) Bill, which was initially set for tomorrow (24).

The decision was made during a meeting held yesterday, chaired by Speaker Dr. Jagath Wickramaratne, according to Secretary General of Parliament Kushani Rohanadeera.

The second reading of the Bill will be postponed to a later date due to technical matters that need to be addressed before the debate can proceed.

In place of the postponed debate, Parliament will hold an Adjournment Debate on the “Proposed New Education Reforms” on 24 July. The discussion will continue until 5.30 p.m. and will be based on a motion presented by the Government.
