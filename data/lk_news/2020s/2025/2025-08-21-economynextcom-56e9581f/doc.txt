Sri Lanka Mirigama export zone not suited for growing cannabis: MP

ECONOMYNEXT – The government’s decision to allow cannabis cultivation in an export processing zone in Mirigama, close to Colombo, was not a good plan, an opposition legislator has said.

“I personally don’t oppose plans to cultivate cannabis [kan-sa]; if it brings investments into the country, suits the export economy, and you can forget what you said in the past, it is ok [ka-mak ne-he],” Nalin Bandara told parliament.

“But Mirigama land is not suited for this [ko-heth-ma su-du-su ne-he].”

“The land you have identified for the purpose in the Mirigama zone shouldn’t be given for kansa cultivation; it’s infrastructure facilities should be developed and it should be given for other investments targeting export goals.

“Kansa should be grown in areas well known for its cultivation; Wellawaya, Pahala Uva.”

Lands in export zones closer to Colombo like Mirigama, Biyagama, Katunayake, Koggala, and Malwathu Hiripitiya are short of land to offer other investors, he said.

“We don’t have lands in zones around Colombo left to give investors.”

“Although there is land available in the Bingiriya zone, which I was part of, investors want lands closer to Colombo.”

About 99 percent of land in the Mirigama zone was already given to investors, Bandara said. (Colombo/Aug21/2025)
