Sri Lankan design talent  makes global mark at  Graduate Fashion Week London

When Sri Lankan design talent takes the stage at events like London’s Graduate Fashion Week, it signals more than individual success, it proves that creative youth from our island can compete globally and highlights the untapped potential of our creative industries.

This year, that promise was brought to life by Nethangi Fernando, an emerging designer from AOD, who presented her final-year collection at the world’s largest platform for new fashion talent. Her work, developed in collaboration with Inqube — a Brandix innovation arm showcased how local education, combined with strong industry partnerships, can deliver global impact.

Following her showcase, Nethangi joined Inqube’s design team, marking a smooth transition from student to professional. Her journey is a powerful example of AOD’s international curriculum and industry-integrated model working together to launch creative careers that reach far beyond Sri Lanka.

AOD, in partnership with Northumbria University UK, offers globally recognised design degrees right in Colombo. Based at the Colombo Innovation Tower, students gain real-world exposure through future-ready programs in Fashion, Visual Communication, Interior Architecture, Animation, and more. AOD’s Design Foundation Program also provides post-O/L students with an early start toward global creative careers.

AOD’s education model emphasises strong industry collaboration, connecting students with leading apparel manufacturers, tech innovators, and export-driven businesses. Through live projects, internships, and mentorships, students build strong portfolios and gain market-ready experience. Nethangi’s final-year collaboration with Inqube, which led to an international showcase, highlights how such exposure prepares graduates for success in global fashion and the region’s innovation economy.

In a world increasingly shaped by design, innovation, and digital content, creative industries are among the fastest-growing sectors. Despite Sri Lanka’s rich craft heritage and export potential, creative education remains under-recognised. AOD addresses this by offering globally benchmarked programs, starting from post-O/Ls that align with international standards and local industry needs, preparing students to lead in both global and local creative economies.

Nethangi joins a growing list of AOD alumni, like Amesh Wijesekara and Ruwanthi Gajadeera, who’ve gained global recognition at events like London Fashion Week. Their success shows how design education can elevate both individual careers and Sri Lanka’s presence in the global creative arena.

For parents, educators, and policymakers, Nethangi’s journey illustrates how creative education, when done right, can unlock serious professional opportunities. It challenges the conventional thinking that only traditional disciplines lead to stable or impactful careers. Design, when combined with strategy, technology, and business acumen, is a powerful force in the modern economy.

AOD is committed to shaping young talent with strong foundations, global exposure, and industry readiness. Its Design Foundation Program is the perfect starting point for post-O/L students to launch successful creative careers on global platforms.
