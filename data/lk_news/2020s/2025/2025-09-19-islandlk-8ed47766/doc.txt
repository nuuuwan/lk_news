ComBank partners with Indira Cancer Trust to raise breast cancer awareness

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has joined hands with the Indira Cancer Trust (ICT) as the Gold Sponsor of the TLC (Touch | Look | Check) – Triathlon 2025, a nationwide series of events to raise awareness of breast cancer – which tragically claims three lives a day in Sri Lanka – reaffirming the Bank’s commitment to empower women and promote community well-being as a core pillar of its corporate social responsibility efforts.

This unique initiative combines the power of sport with health education to highlight the importance of early detection of breast cancer, as part of the Trust’s activities in the month of October.

The TLC Triathlon 2025 will be the first nationwide triathlon series in the country, to take the message of breast self-examination to the public. The triathlon will take place across four cities – Kilinochchi, Batticaloa, Matara, and Colombo – through a combination of swimming, cycling, and running.
