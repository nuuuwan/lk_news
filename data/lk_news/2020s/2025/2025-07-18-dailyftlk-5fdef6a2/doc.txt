Kumbal and Randoli Perahera scheduled to parade streets for 10 days from 30 July

The Sri Dalada Esala Perahera of the Sacred Temple of the Tooth Relic in Kandy is scheduled to commence on 25 July, with the ‘Kap Situweema’ ceremony.

Diyawadana Nilame (Chief Custodian of Sri Dalada Maligawa) Pradeep Nilanga Dela said the annual Kandy Perahera will commence with the ‘Kap planting’ ritual at the four main devalayas, which will be followed by the five-day process of Ethul Perahera.

Accordingly, the Kumbal Perahera and Randoli Perahera are scheduled to parade the streets for 10 days, starting from 30 July.

Meanwhile, Pradeep Nilanga Dela also stated that the shortage of elephants for the Esala Perahera has become a major concern.
