Sri Lanka parliament committee approves National Building Research Institute Bill

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s National Building Research Institute Bill, which strengthens the National Building Research Organization’s powers, has been considered and approved by a sectoral oversight committee, parliament said.

“Although the National Building Research Organization has been functioning since 1984, it has not yet been established by an Act of Parliament.

“Therefore, the proposed Bill seeks to provide the Organization with legal status in order to properly fulfil the duties, responsibilities, and services entrusted to it.”

Officials, making submissions before the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Governance, Justice and Civil Protection, pointed out that once the proposed bill is passed, the NBRO would be able to take legal action in instances where Local Government institutions fail to adhere to the recommendations issued by the NBRO with regard to landslides.

The bill is to be taken up for its second reading in parliament on September 23. (Colombo/Sep17/2025)
