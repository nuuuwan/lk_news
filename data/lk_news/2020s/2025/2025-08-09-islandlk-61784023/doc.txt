The International Institute of Health Sciences (IIHS) recently celebrated the second anniversary of its Multiversity campus in Kerawalapitiya, bringing together students, staff, and guests to mark two years of activity at the purpose-built facility. “IIHS has always been driven by a mission to empower students with knowledge, skills, and global values. The opening of the Multiversity marked a step towards offering a purpose-built environment to foster a globally relevant, innovative, and holistic academic experience. It has since evolved into a dynamic academic and cultural hub. With world-class facilities, modern infrastructure, and collaborative spaces, it has redefined how students engage with learning and with each other.” said IIHS Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Kithsiri Edirisinghe.
