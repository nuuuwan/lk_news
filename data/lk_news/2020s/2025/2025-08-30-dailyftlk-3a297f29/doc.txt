Rajitha remanded till 9 September over Kirinda Harbour case

Former Fisheries Minister Rajitha Senaratne was taken to prison after being remanded yesterday

Former Fisheries Minister Rajitha Senaratne was yesterday ordered to be remanded till 9 September by Colombo Chief Magistrate Asanga S. Bodaragama in connection with a corruption case linked to the Kirinda Fisheries Harbour project.

Senaratne, who was brought to Court under prison custody, had earlier been produced before the Colombo High Court in relation to a separate case.

The High Court Judge subsequently directed that he be placed in remand custody and produced before the Magistrate’s Court.

The remand order stems from allegations that Senaratne, during his tenure as Fisheries Minister, caused a financial loss exceeding Rs. 20 million to the Government by awarding a sand mining project at the Kirinda Fisheries Harbour to a Korean company.

A warrant for his arrest had previously been issued by the Magistrate’s Court.

The Magistrate further instructed prison authorities to ensure that Senaratne is produced before the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) on 3 September at 9 a.m. to record his statement.
