Sampath Manamperi surrenders to Court

Sampath Manamperi, wanted in connection with the discovery of two containers of chemicals suspected to be used in the manufacture of crystal methamphetamine (Ice) in the Middeniya area, surrendered to the Walasmulla Magistrate’s Court yesterday.

The containers, allegedly linked to underworld figure Kehelbaddara Padme, were said to contain raw materials used in the production of the drug. Manamperi’s attorney had earlier informed the Court of Appeal that his client was prepared to appear before the relevant Magistrate’s Court.

Following this submission, the Court of Appeal directed the Inspector General of Police to ensure the suspect’s safety upon surrender, with investigating officers instructed to comply with the order.
