Indian Rs600mn grant to construct ETU at Sri Lanka’s Mannar hospital

ECONOMYNEXT – India is providing a 600 million rupee grant to construct and supply medical equipment TO an accident and emergency unit at the District General Hospital, in Mannar, Sri Lanka.

The project involves civil construction of a two-storey accident and emergency (A&E) unit and procurement of all necessary medical equipment for the unit.
