The Health Ministry yesterday commenced the six-month Nursing Substitution and Coordination Training Course for 700 graduates at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka, marking the first such recruitment since 2021 and a renewed effort to strengthen the country’s healthcare workforce.

The awarding of appointment letters took place at the Outpatient Department Auditorium of the National Hospital under the patronage of Health Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa, who noted that 4,141 nursing officers have been recruited this year—the largest intake in recent history.

He further announced that another 2,600 recruits are scheduled to join soon, bringing the country’s total nursing cadre to about 43,500 personnel.

“This group is entering the nursing service at a time when the public health sector is being strengthened and facilities are improving,” Dr. Jayatissa said, assuring that appointments will be made in line with public service regulations and with the consent of the Public Service Commission.

He also revealed that steps have been taken to obtain approval to recruit 825 more nursing graduates in 2025, addressing long-standing vacancies in hospitals across the country.

The Minister highlighted that modern technology will be increasingly integrated into healthcare, disclosing plans to introduce a citizens’ e-Health service to enhance patient care and record management.

Nursing graduates who have completed their Bachelor of Science in Nursing from National Universities are eligible for the six-month training, after which they will be appointed as Grade III Graduate Nursing Officers based on service requirements.

The recruitment process had been suspended since 2021 due to delays in Treasury approval and has now resumed after four years. Appointed graduates must report to their respective Nursing Colleges on 6 November, before being assigned to 31 hospitals for practical training.
