A Landmark Ruling for the Buddhist world: Supreme Court of Sri Lanka Recognises Bhikkhuni Identity

In an era when constitutional justice is often contested in the glare of the media, one of the most significant rulings in Sri Lanka’s legal and religious history, was delivered almost unnoticed — yet its implications could echo globally.

On 16 June 2025, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka delivered a majority ruling in SC/FR/218/2013, affirming the fundamental rights of a Buddhist nun to be identified as “Bhikkhuni” on her National Identity Card (NIC), thereby recognizing the de facto existence of the Bhikkhuni Sangha in Sri Lanka.

The case had quietly journeyed through the judicial corridors since it was first filed on 31 May 2013, argued before the bench on 24 October 2024, and culminated in a judgment that both restores dignity and acknowledges history. No protest marches, no press conferences, no talk-show panels. And yet, in its silence, the judgment affirms something extraordinary: the legal, historical, and constitutional validity of the Bhikkhuni Sangha in modern Sri Lanka.

The first petitioner in the case was Venerable Welimada Dhammadinna Bhikkhuni, representing thousands of fully ordained Buddhist nuns who have lived in the shadows of official recognition for decades. The second petitioner was Venerable Inamaluwe Sri Sumangala Thero, the Mahanayaka of the Rangiri Dambulla Chapter of the Siyam Nikāya—who has, since 1998, presided over the re-establishment of the Bhikkhuni ordination within his chapter.

Their petition was entrusted to the skill and dedication of a distinguished legal team: President’s Counsel Navin Marapana, with Nandapala Wickramasooriya, Tharanatha Palliyaguruge, and Uchitha Wickramasinghe, instructed by, Ms Eashanie Palliyaguruge.

At the heart of the case was the Department for Registration of Persons’ refusal to issue a NIC bearing the title “Bhikkhuni” for Venerable Dhammadinna. The Department argued that it required verification from the Department of Buddhist Affairs — a government body that, crucially, does not register Bhikkhunis at all. This created a bureaucratic deadlock and denied the petitioner her right to equal recognition.

Supporting the refusal were letters and opinions from the Mahanayakas of the dominant monastic fraternities—Malwathu and Asgiri Chapters of the Siyam Nikāya, and the Amarapura and Rāmañña Nikāyas—who claimed that the Bhikkhuni Sangha no longer existed, and that its recognition would contravene Vinaya (monastic law) and the Constitution’s Article 9 duty to “protect and foster the Buddha Sāsana”.

In stark contrast, the Rangiri Dambulla Chapter maintained that it had legally and validly revived the Bhikkhuni Sangha in 1998, with over 3,000 Bhikkhunis residing in 237 monasteries across Sri Lanka, practising the Vinaya and receiving public support and state recognition through passports, exam results, and now, identity cards.

Justice E.A.G.R. Amarasekara, writing the majority judgement (concurred by Chief Justice Murdu N.B. Fernando), held that the refusal to issue a NIC identifying the petitioner as “Bhikkhuni” was unconstitutional. It violated Article 12(1) of the Constitution, which guarantees equality before the law, and Article 14(1)(e), which guarantees the right to practise one’s religion individually or in association with others.

The Court recognized that the Bhikkhuni Sāsanaya has existed de facto in Sri Lanka since 1998. It acknowledged the Rangiri Dambulla Chapter’s authority and the absence of any disciplinary action from other Nikāyas as tacit consent or lack of jurisdiction.

The circular requiring verification from a department that does not register Bhikkhunis was declared “irrational, arbitrary, and discriminatory”. The Court noted that this effectively locked Bhikkhunis out of the legal system.

Since Bhikkhunis had previously received NICs bearing their monastic title, the petitioner had a legitimate expectation for the same treatment. The denial thus infringed her right to equal treatment and religious freedom.

The judgement was allowed with costs, requiring the State to cover legal expenses—a rare and emphatic statement of support.

Justice Mahinda Samayawardhena dissented, arguing that ordination was a religious matter best left to ecclesiastical authority.

While the ruling is specific to a national identity card in Sri Lanka, its implications ripple far beyond.

This decision legally affirms the revival of the Bhikkhuni Sāsanaya as a constitutionally protected reality, restoring to ordained Buddhist women the right to public recognition of their monastic status. It provides legal and institutional grounding for policy reform across public institutions—from education to counselling and temple governance.

Perhaps more importantly, it sets a precedent for the global Bhikkhuni community. It demonstrates that even in traditions resistant to reform, the voice of justice can prevail quietly, respectfully, and irrevocably.

As Venerable Dhammadinna’s petition now results in official recognition—not just for her, but for thousands of other nuns—it sends a powerful message: The doors are now open to harness the talents, compassion, and wisdom of the Bhikkhuni Sangha for the betterment of society.

No longer invisible. Legally recognized, and spiritually affirmed, the Bhikkhuni Sangha now takes its place in the Fourfold Assembly, just as the Buddha originally demonstrated and practiced.

The ruling is not just a legal milestone; it is a moral turning point. And from this point forward, history — and the Buddha Dhamma — will remember.
