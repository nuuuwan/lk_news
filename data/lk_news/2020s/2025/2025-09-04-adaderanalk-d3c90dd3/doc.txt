CEB workers to launch ‘work-to-rule’ trade union today

All trade unions of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) have decided to launch a work-to-rule trade union action today (04).

The decision has been taken to oppose the decision to restructure the Ceylon Electricity Board and several employee demands.

According to a spokesperson, the trade union action is being launched based on 16 demands, including the restructuring process of the CEB being carried out in an illegal manner that severely inconveniences employees, as well as issues such as lack of incentives and promotions.
