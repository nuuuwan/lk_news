Panasian Powerâ€™s 5 MW Galle solar plant fully operational

Panasian Power PLC yesterday said that its 5 MW ground-mounted solar project in Galle has successfully connected to the grid and running at full capacity.

The plant had initially connected to the Galle Grid Substation on 29 August. However, due to limitations in the transmission network, the plant was not operating in its full capacity, the company said in a statement.

The CEB confirmed that the necessary upgrades have been done and accordingly, the plant was operating at full capacity from 4 September, the company said.

This is the 4th 5 MW ground-mounted solar power plant connected to the national grid out of the seven projects which the company entered into PPAs in 2024.
