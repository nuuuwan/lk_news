No more special offices for foreign funded development projects

President Anura Kumara Disanayake has given instructions to discontinue the practice of establishing special offices for foreign-funded development projects, the Presidentâ€™s Media Division said.

Meeting with Provincial Governors and Chief Ministers ahead of the 2026 Budget, the President instructed Provincial Governors and Secretaries that projects funded through foreign loans and aid should not be carried out through special project offices that require large administrative expenditures.

Instead, they should be implemented within the existing administrative structure, completed within the stipulated timeframes and the benefits delivered directly to the people, the PMD said.

Discussions focused on challenges in education, health and highways, along with possible solutions and proposals.
