Sri Lanka shifts school book printing to private sector to cut costs: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has awarded 60 percent of its school textbooks and modules printing requirement to 29 private companies, since the government printer is not cost effective, Minister Nalinda Jayatissa said.

“The state printing organizations do not offer market competitive rates,” Jayatissa told reporters.

“They have been overstaffed by previous governments, and staff have been given various incentive schemes over the years. This increases their cost of production and they can’t compete with private companies. Printing outside is cheaper for the government.

“The state organizations will be printing 40 percent of the requirement.”

Another 27.12 million copies of 366 types of textbooks/modules need to be printed, he said.

“25.49 million copies of 362 relevant textbooks/modules will be printed by these 29 institutions at a cost of 3,491.47 million rupees.

“Whether the SPC or private companies print them, the treasury pays for it.” (Colombo/Sep9/2025)
