Sunny Leone loves Sri Lanka ‘orange coconut’

ECONOMYNEXT – Bollywood actress and adult entertainer Sunny Leone has said she loves Sri Lanka’s king coconuts, which she called orange coconut, in a ticktok video made in Colombo during a visit this month.

“Fun fact, the very first time I came here was the first time I tried orange coconuts,” she says in the video shot while travelling from the airport to the city.

“And they are so much better than green coconuts. Maybe I will find one here.”

King coconuts are orange coloured and are picked young before they fully are ripe for their juice and soft and sweet kernel which can be scraped off with a spoon.

Colombo’s Bally’s Casino also posted a tiktok showing her in an event.

“Another fun fact. I shot my very first movie Bollywood here in Sri Lanka,” she continued. “It was really cool. I had some extremely interesting experiences here (smiles). One day I will do a tell all and tell all the goss.”

Canadian born Leone, whose parents were Indian, later became an American citizen and starred in erotic videos, before acting in mainstream Bollywood movies.

Her first film Jism 2, was shot in India and Sri Lanka. (Colombo/July15/2025)
