Nawaloka Hospitals sets new standard in liver diagnostics

Nawaloka Hospitals PLC has once again reaffirmed its commitment to world-class patient care by introducing the FibroScan 630 Expert ,the latest, most advanced non-invasive liver diagnostic technology.

The FibroScan 630 Expert represents a significant breakthrough in hepatology, offering painless, radiation-free, and highly precise assessments of liver stiffness (fibrosis) and steatosis (fat accumulation) through Vibration-Controlled Transient Elastography (VCTE) and Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP) technologies.

This state-of-the-art technology enables early detection and monitoring of liver-related conditions, including:

“Liver disease often develops silently, and by the time symptoms appear, damage can be severe. With the FibroScan 630 Expert, we can now identify early warning signs in a matter of minutes, enabling patients to take timely action and avoid life-threatening complications,” said Dr. Jayantha Darmadasa, Chairman of Nawaloka Hospitals PLC. “This investment reflects our mission to bring the latest medical innovations to Sri Lanka, empowering communities with better access to advanced, patient-friendly healthcare.”

Painless, Radiation-Free Testing: No needles, no biopsies, no radiation—just a comfortable, quick procedure completed in under 10 minutes.

Ideal for Screening: With 60% of diabetic patients at risk of MASLD and rising cases of fatty liver in Sri Lanka, this tool allows for widespread, effective screening of at-risk groups.

Supports Preventive Healthcare: Detecting fibrosis or steatosis at early stages prevents progression to liver failure, reducing hospital admissions and easing the burden on families and the healthcare system.

Personalized Treatment Planning: Real-time, quantifiable results help physicians create individualized management plans covering medication, diet, and lifestyle.

As Sri Lanka faces increasing lifestyle-related diseases, the FibroScan 630 Expert provides a transformative step forward in preventive medicine and patient care.

By adopting this technology, Nawaloka Hospitals continues to lead the way in introducing cutting-edge medical solutions to the nation, underscoring its role as a trusted partner in health for every Sri Lankan.
