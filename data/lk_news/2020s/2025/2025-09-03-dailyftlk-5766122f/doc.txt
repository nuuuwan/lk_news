SEC defers Dockyard trading suspension until 11 December

The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday deferred the trading suspension of Colombo Dockyard PLC shares, the company said in a stock exchange filing.

The suspension was due to take effect on 10 September 2025 after the securities of the company were twice transferred to the Colombo Stock Exchange Watch List: first in 10 June 2024, and a year later on 16 June 2025 due to the emphasis of matter on going concern contained in the Independent Auditorâ€™s Reports for the financial years ended 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2024 respectively, the stock exchange filing said.

The SEC has deferred the trading suspension until 11 December 2025.
