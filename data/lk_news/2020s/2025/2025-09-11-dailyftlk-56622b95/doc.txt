Ranil condemns Nepal violence, urges return to peace

Ex-President Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday expressed distress over the unfolding violence in Kathmandu, condemning the unrest and urging a return to peace and stability in Nepal.

In a statement, he said he condemns all kinds of killings, including those of the youth that has occurred in Nepal, adding that the burning of a former prime minister’s home and the killing of his wife was a “deeply tragic situation.” He extended his condolences to the victims’ families.

Wickremesinghe noted that assaults on government officials, including the foreign minister, reflected a worsening crisis, stressing that women’s rights had been gravely violated and that such events had damaged Nepal’s standing abroad. He criticised police shootings as an “unacceptable course of action,” saying the unrest should never have been allowed to escalate.

Referring to reports that the violence could have been contained without gunfire on the first day, he warned of the dangers of further deterioration. He also drew attention to the role of global social media platforms, stating: “The opportunity that American-owned social media companies like Google, Facebook, and YouTube have presented to overthrow governments in countries around the world cannot be underestimated.”

He argued that Nepal’s turmoil was rooted in long-neglected issues, worsened by leaders prioritising day-to-day politics over structural solutions. This neglect, he said, had fuelled youth frustration, which was only aggravated by the government’s sweeping ban on social media.

The former president strongly denounced the arson attacks on Nepal’s parliament and judiciary buildings, calling it “a great disrespect to Nepal’s democracy.” He warned that the country risked being left “without a constitution” and said it was now the duty of the military, which has assumed control, to restore order and ensure elections are held under constitutional provisions.

Reflecting on Sri Lanka’s ties with Nepal, Wickremesinghe emphasised that the birthplace of the Buddha held a unique cultural and spiritual importance. He described the violence as “barbaric acts” inconsistent with the country’s heritage and urged Nepal’s leaders to follow the Buddha’s teaching to “gather in harmony, discuss in harmony, and disperse in harmony.”
