Harsh reality of kidney crisis

Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology (CKDU) is a condition where the cause is not easily identifiable. This continues to be a challenge among young and middle-aged individuals in rural communities. The disease has taken a heavy toll on the workforce, especially farmers and their families.

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a broader term for progressive kidney damage and loss of function, typically linked to known causes such as diabetes, hypertension, or infections. CKDU, however, is a specific form of CKD where the underlying cause cannot be traced to these common factors. Unlike CKD, which has well-documented triggers, CKDU lacks a clear single origin. It is believed to be multifactorial, with possible ties to environmental conditions and occupational hazards in agricultural settings.

While CKD affects people across all ages and backgrounds, CKDU strikes hardest at working-age adults in rural farming communities, concentrated in certain geographical pockets. Its emergence has been associated with contaminated groundwater and prolonged exposure to agrochemicals.

In 2025, the International Society of Nephrology highlighted ongoing international efforts to better understand and combat CKDU through global collaboration and research. Yet, the disease continues to impose a significant economic and social burden on the nation and its most vulnerable communities.

CKDU is endemic to specific rural areas of Sri Lanka, most notably the North Central region and other dry-zone districts. The consumption of contaminated groundwater — containing geogenic contaminants such as fluoride, total dissolved solids, and other Hofmeister ions — has been identified as a primary risk factor. In addition, exposure to agrochemicals and mycotoxins are suspected contributors. Poverty, traditional practices, and the everyday living habits of affected communities, particularly among male paddy farmers, have also been closely associated with the disease.

The condition first came to light in the early 1990s, when it was recognised and reported among agricultural communities in the North Central Province. By 1994, CKDU was officially reported in Sri Lanka, with initial cases concentrated among male farmers engaged in agricultural work, especially chena cultivation. Over time, the disease spread beyond the North Central Province to neighbouring regions, including the North-Western, Eastern, and Uva provinces.

Today, efforts are under way to sustain momentum in CKDU research, with global experts sharing insights and progress in unravelling the disease. The International Society of Nephrology continues to play a leading role in closing critical knowledge gaps in kidney care, addressing the challenges of CKDU, and advancing specialised training for nephrologists worldwide.

Dialysis is free in public hospitals, but access is limited. Patients often face long waiting lists, with younger individuals who have the prospect of a transplant sometimes given priority. Public dialysis units are overwhelmed by demand, leaving many in desperate situations. Private dialysis, while available, comes at a heavy out-of-pocket cost — around Rs. 8,000 per session, translating to Rs. 663,000–994,000 annually (based on 2024 data). For most families, this is an unbearable financial burden.

Unlike other kidney patients, the vast majority in Sri Lanka are not suffering from CKD with known causes, but from CKDU — an illness with uncertain origins. Most of those affected are family breadwinners, now unable to support their loved ones. Instead, it is their families — and in many cases, even schoolchildren — who must care for them. Some children drop out of school to look after sick parents or siblings, while others are left without guardians altogether, as CKDU has already claimed their loved ones. This tragedy, which struck rural Sri Lanka decades ago, feels almost like a curse that continues to haunt these communities.

This crisis also highlights a responsibility for Sri Lankan media: to educate the public relentlessly about the importance of regular screening. Consultants stress that screening is the only real defence at present. Detecting the disease in its silent, early stages can save lives and preserve livelihoods. Without such efforts, CKDU risks becoming a pandemic within the nation’s borders.

Screening for CKDU typically involves specific blood tests. In endemic areas, a combination of serum creatinine (S.Cr) and a lower albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) cutoff is recommended for better detection. New markers such as serum cystatin C (S.Cys) and gene panels are being researched, but remain costly and impractical for widespread use. Even the basic diagnostic tests are prohibitively expensive for most affected families. While some media outlets occasionally sponsor free screenings, these efforts are neither regular nor sufficient.

This is where Government intervention becomes vital. Regular, state-sponsored free screening programmes are urgently needed to protect vulnerable populations and safeguard the nation’s workforce. Such an approach would not only curb the human toll but also prevent the “evil bonus” of social breakdown that accompanies this incurable disease. Prevention, after all, is better than cure — and far less costly than the medical and economic burden CKDU continues to impose.
