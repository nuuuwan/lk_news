Sri Lanka  vehicle import LCs to reach US$1,500-1,800mn in 2025: President

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has seen 1,260 million dollars in letters of credit opened to buy vehicles so far this year, President Anura Dissanayake told parliament, adding that the government expects this to increase to 1,500 and 1,800 million dollars by the end of the year.

“Since we resumed imports, letters of credit have been opened to the value of 1,260 million dollars,” Dissanayake said.

“We expect this to be between 1,500 and 1,800 million dollars by December.”

But saboteurs were spreading rumors that vehicle imports will cease to manipulate the rupee, he said.

“Then people who plan to buy a vehicle next year will also rush to buy this year.

This would cost the government an additional 1,800 million dollars, which the government would have to find ways to finance, he said.

The government expects to grow reserves to 7 billion dollars by the end of this year, he said. (Colombo/Aug7/2025)
