During questioning, it was revealed that Athige Primal Dhanuka Silva had acted as the shooter in the murder of Dan Priyasad. He has also been identified as the main suspect in an attempted shooting reported on 28 March 2024 in the Mahabhage Police Division.

The suspects are scheduled to be produced before the Kegalle Magistrate’s Court on 19 September.

Dan Priyasad, convenor of the “Nawa Sinhale National Movement” and a prominent political activist, was shot on the night of April 22 at the Laksanda Sevana Housing Complex in Wellampitiya. He was admitted to the Colombo National Hospital with gunshot wounds but succumbed to his injuries shortly after.

Reports indicate that Priyasad was shot four times—twice in the chest and twice in the shoulder.

Following the incident, key suspects in the murder, including Priyasad’s brother—a father-son duo identified as Bandula Piyal and Madhava Sudarshana—had reportedly fled their residences.

In response, the Western Province South Crime Division launched a comprehensive investigation, leading to the arrest of a suspect, identified as Dulan, two days later.

During interrogation, Dulan revealed that the murder had been orchestrated under the direction of notorious organized criminal and large-scale drug trafficker ‘Kanjipani Imran’. It was further disclosed that the father-son duo had been involved in the execution of the crime.

Based on intelligence indicating the father’s presence in the Cinnamon Gardens area, police officers proceeded to arrest him on May 2.
