‘I Don’t Engage in Dirty Politics’ – Sajith

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa emphasized that he does not engage in “dirty politics,” while addressing issues faced by the people during his Mobile Service program in the Kalawewa–Galnewa area.

Premadasa accused the government of planning to increase electricity tariffs in line with the IMF’s directives, despite public expectations of a reduction. He claimed that a token reduction may be offered during the election period to secure votes.

Highlighting the struggles of paddy farmers, he said that the government has failed to deliver on its promise of a guaranteed price of Rs. 120 per kilogram of paddy. Currently, wet paddy is being sold between Rs. 85–95 and dry paddy around Rs. 105, leaving farmers in severe hardship.

Premadasa also criticized farmer representatives, noting that while they once pledged a guaranteed price of Rs. 150, today even Rs. 120 is not being provided. He accused the government of bowing to IMF pressure, which he said has directly contributed to the rise in electricity costs and the decline in farmers’ livelihoods.
