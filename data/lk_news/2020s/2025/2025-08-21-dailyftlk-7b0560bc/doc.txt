CID arrests ex-IGP Deshabandu

Former Inspector General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Thennakoon was arrested yesterday by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in connection with the violent crackdown on peaceful protesters at Galle Face Green during the 2022 Aragalaya movement.

The arrest follows the decision by the Attorney General to name Thennakoon as a suspect in the case, which relates to the assault on peaceful demonstrators.

Prior to his arrest, Thennakoon had filed an anticipatory bail application before the Fort Magistrateâ€™s Court, citing concerns over a possible arrest. However, the Court rejected the application.

On 5 August, Parliament passed a resolution to remove Thennakoon from his post as IGP, with 177 MPs voting in favour and none against. One MP abstained. This was the first time Parliament had voted to remove a sitting IGP.
