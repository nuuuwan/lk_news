Sri Lanka conflict sees 484 elephants, 148 humans killed in year

ECONOMYNEXT – A human elephant conflict has left 182 humans and 484 pachyderms killed in 2023, President Anura Dissanayake said launching an initiative called Clean Sri Lanka.

He said that a main focus of the Clean Sri Lanka initiative is to restore the country’s environment.

Sri Lanka has around 7,000 elephants based on the last count, but some estimate that the actual population maybe higher.

Increasing numbers of elephants are raiding farms and houses, and farmers have retaliated with electric fences and gun traps.

Dissanayake pointed out that 595 people died from drowning last year. (Colombo/Jan1/2024)
