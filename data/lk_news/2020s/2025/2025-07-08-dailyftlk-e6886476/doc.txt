H One secures top spot at Microsoft Agentic AI Hackathon

H One, a leading innovator in enterprise AI solutions and a trusted Microsoft partner, has announced its victory at the regional Microsoft Agentic AI Hackathon.

Held in a hybrid format and featuring top talent from across the region, the event brought together pioneering minds in technology to showcase next-generation Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions. Team H One emerged as the winner for Sri Lanka with two transformative innovations tackling challenges in the insurance and data analytics sectors.

The first solution, InsurGENT, reimagines the insurance claim experience through a fully automated, intelligent verification platform. Powered by Microsoft Azure AI, InsurGENT streamlines the handling of both medical and motor insurance claims by automating the review of handwritten prescriptions and repair estimates. This delivers a seamless digital experience for customers with 24/7 self-service, real-time claim updates, and faster resolution, while significantly reducing manual workloads and processing delays. For insurers, the benefits include increased accuracy, operational efficiency, and enhanced customer satisfaction.

Complementing this is Nexis Engine, a secure, AI-driven chatbot designed to democratise data access within organisations. Nexis Engine allows both technical and non-technical users to interact with databases using natural language, automatically translating queries into optimised SQL and providing real-time insights with built-in visualisations. Deployed securely via Azure AI Foundry, the solution prioritises data privacy while enabling faster, insight-driven decisions and reducing reliance on specialised data personnel.

InsurGENT and Nexis Engine will be published on the Microsoft Marketplace, making them available to customers worldwide.

By encouraging the development of innovative solutions, the hackathon significantly contributes to the technological growth and problem-solving capabilities of the community.
