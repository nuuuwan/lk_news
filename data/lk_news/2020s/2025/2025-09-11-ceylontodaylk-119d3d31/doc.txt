Court Orders Forensic Test on Child Porn Evidence

Colombo Additional Magistrate Oshadha Migara Mahaarachchi, yesterday (10), directed the Police Children and Women Bureau to submit the pornographic videos and images allegedly involving Sri Lankan minors — seized during an ongoing investigation — to the Government Analyst for a detailed forensic report.

The order was issued after considering a request made by the Bureau, which had taken into custody several items of evidence, including computers, mobile phones, videos, and photographs linked to the case.

The Bureau informed the Court that the investigation was launched based on a complaint received through the US-based National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC). The Bureau further stated that it continues to receive numerous similar complaints through this channel. NCMEC, which operates globally and partners with law enforcement agencies in several countries, uses specialised software to detect and flag the sharing or possession of nude images or videos of children via digital devices and the Internet, the Bureau told the Court.

The Bureau also informed the Court that a growing number of individuals in Sri Lanka are using the Internet to download and circulate pornographic material involving minors through mobile phones and social media platforms.

In December 2024, Colombo Additional Magistrate Keminda Perera ordered the Police Children and Women Bureau to investigate and report to the Court on a group of Sri Lankans who uploaded pornographic photographs and footage to the Internet.

Magistrate Keminda Perera at that time observed that the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the USA had revealed that a group of Sri Lankans uploaded children’s pornographic photographs and footage to the Internet.

The Court also observed that the same institution had found out through which machines this footage was uploaded to the Internet. The officials submitted that the NCMEC had shared those details with the Sri Lankan authorities. The officials in 2024 also informed the Court that complaints are being made to them of similar incidents, yet not a single child victim has been found so far.
