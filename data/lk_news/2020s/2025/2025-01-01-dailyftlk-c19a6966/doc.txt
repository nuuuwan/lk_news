Cabinet green lights review of Anti-Corruption Act amid implementation challenges

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday gave its green light for the formation of a committee to address loopholes in legal and technical issues arising from the implementation of the Anti-Corruption Act No. 9 of 2023.

The Act which aims to strengthen anti-corruption measures has presented significant issues for the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) in conducting investigations, prosecutions and judicial and administrative activities.

In response to these challenges, the CIABOC has proposed amendments to certain sections of the Act and the inclusion of new provisions to facilitate smoother enforcement.

The committee will be chaired by the CIABOC Chairperson and will comprise senior officials from the Nation Integration Ministry, Department of the Attorney General and the Department of Legal Draftsman.

“The committee is tasked to conduct a comprehensive review of the Act’s provisions and submit a detailed report highlighting mandatory amendments and proposed new sections,” Cabinet Spokesman and Minster Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said yesterday.

Addressing the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing, he said the proposed amendments by the Committee are expected to strengthen CIABOC’s ability to combat corruption and maintain public trust.

“The report is anticipated to provide clear recommendations to refine the law and align it with practical enforcement needs,” he added.

When asked if there were cases taken up under the existing law, Dr. Jayatissa acknowledged many cases but failed to give a number.
