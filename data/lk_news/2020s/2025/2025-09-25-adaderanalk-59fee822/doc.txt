Cable car accident at Na Uyana Monastery: Several injured monks continue to receive treatment

Several Buddhist monks injured in the cable car accident at the Na Uyana Monastery (Nā Uyana Āranya Senāsanaya) at Pansiyagama in Melsiripura continue to receive treatment at the Kurunegala and Polgahawela hospitals.

The accident reportedly occurred at around 9:00 p.m. yesterday (24), as the monks were returning to their meditation huts after completing a religious ceremony held at the offering ground (Pūjā Bhūmiya).

At the time of the accident, 13 monks were inside the cable car. Among them, seven monks lost their lives.

The injured monks were admitted to the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital and the Polgahawela Hospital for treatment.

It is also reported that five monks managed to jump out of the cable car at the time of the accident, sustaining only minor injuries and thereby saving their lives, while four others suffered serious injuries and are currently hospitalized.

It has been reported that among the deceased monks, three were foreign nationals.

Police suspect that the accident occurred due to the breaking of a support cable on the cable car that was carrying the monks up a hill.
