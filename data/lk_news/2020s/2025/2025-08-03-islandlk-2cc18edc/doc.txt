Network In Action launches Sri Lanka Chapter with vision for high-trust business community

Network In Action (NIA), a global business networking platform, marked its Sri Lankan debut with a launch event at Cinnamon Grand, Colombo.

Hosted by Regional Partners Jayathas Kamalanathan and Pamatheesan Kopalapillai, the gathering introduced entrepreneurs and professionals to NIA’s unique model, blending structured in-person meetings with digital tools for tracking referrals and ROI.

The hosts emphasized their vision of fostering a high-trust business community in Sri Lanka, offering structure, accountability, and global standards. Unlike conventional networking, NIA focuses on long-term relationships, warm referrals, and shared learning rather than self-promotion. With over 200 chapters worldwide, NIA Colombo will provide monthly curated meetings and performance analytics to help members grow sustainably.

Kamalanathan highlighted Sri Lanka’s entrepreneurial talent, stating, “Many seek a consistent way to grow with the right people—that’s what NIA Colombo offers.” The event allowed guests to engage with founding members and like-minded professionals, setting the stage for a collaborative, trust-driven business network in the region.
