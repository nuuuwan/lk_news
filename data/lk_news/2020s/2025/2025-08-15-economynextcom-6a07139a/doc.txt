US envoy calls for reducing Sri Lanka non-tariff barriers

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka should enhance trade facilitation and create a more conducive environment by reducing non-tariff barriers, US ambassador Julie Chung has told representatives of the private sector.

Chung met Ceylon Chamber of Commerce officials to discuss trade, investment, and economic opportunities between Sri Lanka and the United States, the chamber said.

She commended the country’s “negotiation with the United States to achieve a fair, balanced, and reciprocal trade relationship”.

And “urged Sri Lanka to seize this window of opportunity by enhancing trade facilitation and creating a more conducive environment, including reducing non-tariff barriers, enhancing openness, and improving competitiveness”.

US companies are increasingly considering South Asia, with Sri Lanka emerging as a top option, Chung was quoted as saying.

Discussions also covered tourism as a sector with strong growth potential.

Ceylon Chamber Chairman Krishan Balendra said a coordinated destination marketing effort was needed to take advantage of the sector’s growth potential.

Ambassador Chung said that improved infrastructure is a prerequisite for supporting increased tourism inflows.

Balendra asked the US to send a delegation to the Sri Lanka Economic and Investment Summit to be held on December 2-3 in Colombo.

The ambassador invited the chamber to coordinate a business delegation to the SelectUSA
