New Vehicle Number Plates with advanced security features to be issued in November

Transport Minister Bimal Rathnayake said today (26) in Parliament that plans are underway to issue new vehicle number plates with advanced security features. The new plates are expected to be rolled out by 15 November 2025, with a temporary solution introduced in the coming week to address vehicles currently operating without number plates.

Regarding delays in issuing driving licences, Minister Rathnayake confirmed that a backlog of 900,000 licences had been cleared by April this year.

He added that driving licences with updated security features will also be distributed in the future.
