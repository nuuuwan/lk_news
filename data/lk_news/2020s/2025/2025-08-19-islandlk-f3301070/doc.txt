Dress Codes, Human Rights, Professional Image, and Cultural Identity

On a typical weekday in Colombo, you can spot the contradiction from a bus window: office workers in smart suits and closed shoes hustling through 32°C heat, while street vendors and civil servants, in sarong and short-sleeved shirts, look unbothered. The first are dressed for an imported idea of “professionalism.” The second are dressed for Sri Lanka.

That tension—between code and climate, image and identity—sits at the heart of an overdue debate. Around the world, dress codes are loosening in step with changing norms and warming cities. Here, we still default to Eurocentric formality in many public offices, schools and boardrooms, even as electricity bills soar and commuters wilt. The consequence is more than discomfort. Rigid dress policies can undermine human rights, erase cultural presence, and entrench gendered expectations, all while failing the simple test of common sense in the tropics.

Dress codes aren’t merely about “looking neat.” Scholars have long shown that clothing is a sign system through which organisations communicate status, credibility and belonging. People form split-second judgments from attire, often reading competence or ethicality from a jacket or sari long before a word is spoken. That’s why banks insist on polish at the counter; why schools hope uniforms level the field.

But those judgments are not neutral. They’re learned. And in post-colonial societies, they tend to privilege Western silhouettes (suits, ties, pencil skirts) as the visual grammar of authority. The effect is subtle: a Kandyan sari is “traditional,” a navy blazer is “professional.” The message to a young graduate in breathable cotton or natural hair is equally clear—conform, or be judged before you begin.

Autonomy and expression. Clothing is part of identity. Overly prescriptive rules—make-up mandates for women, bans on headscarves or dreadlocks, blanket prohibitions on tattoos—limit how people present themselves, often with unequal burdens on minorities.

Gender equality. Requirements that are different in cost, discomfort or time (high heels, heavy blazers, compulsory shaving) reproduce stereotypes and unequal labour. They also ignore the reality that “professional” can be achieved in many forms.

Religion and culture. A truly plural society makes space for hijabs, turbans, pottu, and sarongs, provided safety and hygiene are protected. Carving out reasonable accommodation is not special treatment; it is equal treatment that recognises difference.

Bodily health and dignity. Codes that create pain or health risks—heels on long shifts, ties and jackets in stifling rooms—are hard to defend in a warming world. Thermal comfort is not a luxury; it shapes concentration and productivity.

If a dress rule reliably makes you hot, tired and less effective, why keep it? The science of thermal comfort is blunt: in hot, humid climates, lighter fabrics, looser cuts and lower “clothing insulation” keep people comfortable at higher indoor temperatures. That means we can raise air-conditioning set points and still work well—if our clothes aren’t fighting physics. Japan’s well-known “Cool Biz” campaign did exactly that by relaxing summer dress norms and saving energy without sacrificing service.

Sri Lanka is the perfect candidate for a “Tropical Professional” standard: linen and cotton, short sleeves, open collars, breathable sarees, sandals that protect the foot but allow airflow. Less marble-lobby prestige, more climate-smart practicality. It would align comfort with cost and the country’s climate commitments, while letting our own aesthetic traditions shine.

The Vedda community offers a sharp test of our tolerance. Traditional Vedda dress is minimal and functional—built for forest life and tropical heat—often paired with a shoulder-carried axe that is both tool and symbol. In urban spaces, a security guard seeing an axe sees a weapon. An anthropologist sees a cultural marker. A rigid policy sees a breach of code.

Managers often defend strict codes as essential to client trust. The evidence is more nuanced. Attire shapes first impressions, yes, but actual performance links are context-bound. In many services, being comfortably present, culturally fluent and genuinely helpful beats sweating in a suit.

Public service and courts. Colonial-era templates linger: dark coats, ties, closed shoes, and rules that treat sarong as casual unless ritualised. A government circular embracing “Tropical Professional” dress year-round—paired with court-specific guidance that preserves dignity without thermal punishment—would set the tone. (The pandemic era gave us a preview when ministries briefly relaxed codes. We can formalise what worked.)

Schools. Uniforms needn’t enforce conformity at the expense of culture or health. Allowing breathable fabrics, head coverings, natural hair, and climate-sensible cuts—alongside clear safety rules for labs and workshops—would update discipline without dulling diversity.

Private sector. Client-facing policies can stay sharp without being rigid. Replace blanket bans (“no sarong,” “no facial hair,” “no headscarves”) with outcome-based standards: clean, well-fitted, safe for the role, culturally respectful. Let teams co-design what that looks like for their context.

* Climate first. Authorise short sleeves, open collars (no mandatory ties), breathable fabrics, and protective sandals in non-industrial roles. Encourage sarees and sarongs styled for mobility and safety. Set indoor temperatures that reflect tropical comfort—not London chambers.

* One standard, many expressions. Define professionalism by outcomes (clean, modest, functional) rather than specific garments. Provide illustrated guides showcasing acceptable looks across Sri Lankan traditions: Kandyan and Indian saree, hijab-friendly outfits, smart sarong with jacket, shalwar kameez, tailored batik.

* Fairness by design. Eliminate gendered burdens (heels, compulsory cosmetics). Replace lists of “forbidden hairstyles” with simple safety language (hair secured when machinery or flame is present). Permit religious symbols unless they create a demonstrable safety risk.

* Cultural accommodation with safeguards. For Indigenous attire and symbolic implements, adopt tiered protocols: routine accommodation in civic and cultural spaces; case-by-case in high-security venues; alternatives where safety forbids. Develop these rules with community leaders and publish them plainly.

* Manager training and feedback loops. A good policy fails without practice. Train supervisors to apply rules consistently and respectfully. Create discreet channels for staff and students to report problems and propose improvements. Review annually for climate, cost and inclusion.

None of this negates the need for stricter rules in high-risk settings. Hospitals, factories, kitchens and labs require protective gear and closed footwear. Police and armed services need uniformity to function. Even there, climate adaptation matters: lighter weaves, moisture-wicking fabrics, and design tweaks can protect both dignity and performance. The goal is not to abandon standards; it is to update them for where—and who—we are.

Dress codes are often dismissed as superficial. They aren’t. They are a daily test of whether institutions recognise the people they serve. In a country negotiating its plural identity, trying to keep energy costs in check, and facing hotter years ahead, codes that ignore climate and culture are more than outdated—they are counterproductive.

Sri Lanka has a chance to lead. A Cabinet-level circular on climate-appropriate, inclusive dress across the public service would ripple outward to schools and private employers. A judicial practice direction could signal that dignity in court is compatible with tropical dress. Universities could pilot student-led code redesigns, combining safety with self-expression. Media can stop illustrating “professionalism” with stock photos of grey suits and start showing Sri Lankan smart.

The imagined objection comes quickly: won’t standards slip? Only if we confuse rigidity with rigor. It takes more care, not less, to write codes that are fair, functional and future-proof. But the payoff is real: cooler offices, lower bills, wider inclusion, and a professional image that looks like us.

Picture a ministry lobby at noon. A receptionist in a crisp Kandyan saree greets a farmer in a neatly tied sarong and shirt. A junior officer in a tailored batik and open collar guides them to the right desk. Ceiling fans turn lazily above; the air-con hums at a reasonable setting. No one is wilting. No one is turned away for looking “too Sri Lankan.” The work gets done.

That scene is not radical. It is the logical next step for a country that takes its climate, culture and people seriously. Dress codes will always send signals. Let ours say: professional without pretence, modern without amnesia, and proudly, comfortably Sri Lankan.
