# Sri Lanka seeks investors for caustic soda, chlorine production at Paranthan Chemicals

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will call for expressions of interest from local and foreign investors to produce caustic soda and chlorine as a public-private partnership project at the Paranthan Chemicals Limited factory, minister Nalinda Jayatissa said.

“Paranthan Chemicals Limited has completed a feasibility study on restarting the caustic soda, chlorine manufacturing plant at the premises where its Factory is located,” Jayatissa told reporters.

The proposal to look for investors for the proposed project to be implemented on the 30-acre land allocated to Paranthan Chemicals, a state-owned enterprise, was approved by the Cabinet.

Paranthan Chemicals currently imports chlorine and distributes it throughout the country, he said.

“Since the entire chlorine requirement for the country’s water treatment is imported, there is a risk of it being disrupted in the event of disruptions to global supply chains.

“Also, establishing a chlorine manufacturing plant in the country has been identified as a nationally important task to ensure water security.”

Jayatissa said resuming production at the site is expected to create about 95 direct employment opportunities and about 2,000 indirect employment opportunities.

Previous governments have also looked for investors for value addition projects at the factory in Sri Lanka’s north.
