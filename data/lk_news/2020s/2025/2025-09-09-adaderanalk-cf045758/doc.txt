Nepal PM resigns after deadly protests triggered by social media ban

Nepal’s prime minister KP Sharma Oli has resigned after violent anti-corruption protests.

The news comes as demonstrators defied an indefinite curfew and clashed with police, a day after 19 people died in violent protests triggered by a social media ban.

Mr Oli’s government lifted the ban after protests turned violent when police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters trying to storm parliament on Monday.
