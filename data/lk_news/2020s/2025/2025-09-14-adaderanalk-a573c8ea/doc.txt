“President’s Fund which benefited only a limited group has now become a public fund” – PM Harini

Under the present government, the President’s Fund, which had been turned into a privilege for a selected individual groups, is now being utilised 100% for the people, Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya stated.

The Prime Minister made these remarks while attending the Central Province program held today (14) at the Kandy District Secretariat to recognize students who showcased outstanding achievements in the 2023 (2024) and 2024 G.C.E. Advanced Level Examinations, representing each subject stream from every district in the island followed by the decision taken by the President’s Fund.

During the event, the Prime Minister presented certificates to the students who excelled in their respective subject streams.

Extending her best wishes to the students who displayed outstanding performance in the 2023 (2024) and 2024 G.C.E. (Advanced Level) Examinations and to their parents, Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya emphasized that they are expected to contribute to and lead the country’s future transformation through the opportunity they have received today.

When we talk about the president’s funds, what we mostly hear is about how the President’s Fund was misused. A privileged group had used it to increase their own privileges and benefits.

Today, that situation has completely changed, and we are pleased that the President’s Fund is now being used 100% for its true purpose. The fund has now become closer to the people, enabling them to easily access its benefits in their own areas.

Furthermore, the government has recognized human resource development as a key priority. With that aim, we are investing in education. This investment is not only financial but extends across all other aspects as well.

We are in need of a generation of humane citizens who can think in line with a changing world, see every perspective, and bring about change in the world.

Addressing the gathering, Hon. Speaker of Parliament Dr. Jagath Wickramaratne stated:

The President’s Fund belongs to the people, and it is also their utmost right. Our responsibility is to ensure that it is duly placed in the hands of the people.

Amidst this ongoing democratic transformation, the development of human resources is extremely important. Sri Lanka is a country with a large youth population, and therefore this government is creating the educational environment for achieving that cause.

Deputy Minister of Transport and Highways Dr. Prasanna Gunasena remarked that society is looking forward to a generation of children who are not confined to certificates and qualifications in files but are socially sensitive, capable of thinking beyond social frameworks, and prepared to build the country the society demands.

This event was attended by Hon. Speaker of the Parliament of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, Dr. Jagath Wickramaratne; Governor of the Central Province, Prof. S. B. S. Abayakoon; Deputy Minister of  Higher Education, Dr. Madhura Seneviratne; Deputy Minister of Buddha Sasana, Religious, and Cultural Affairs, Gamagedara Dissanayake; Deputy Minister of Transport and Highways, Dr. Prasanna Gunasena; Deputy Minister of Health and Mass Media, Dr. Hansaka Wijemuni; Members of Parliament; officials of the Board of Governors of the President’s Fund; administrative officers; school students; and parents.
