North, East hartal ends after Govt. gives assurance to investigate military death, remove Army camps

Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) MP Shanakiyan Rasamanickam yesterday said the hartal in the North and East was called off by noon the same day after Government assurances to investigate the death of a 32-year-old in Mullaitivu caused by the military.

“The hartal called by the ITAK was a resounding success. Following (Sunday’s) press briefing by the Cabinet Spokesperson, and based on assurances given regarding the investigation and steps being taken towards the removal of Army camps, we decided to limit the hartal until 12 p.m.,” he said on ‘X.’

“I also strongly condemn the actions of National People’s Power (NPP) members in the North and East who have reportedly threatened shop owners to keep their businesses open or face legal consequences — such intimidation is a clear violation of the people’s democratic right to protest,” he added.  However, it was reported that most shops in Jaffna were open, while shops in Kilinochchi stayed shut till about 10:30 a.m. and business and other day-to-day activities in Vavuniya were carried out as usual.

Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa on Sunday said that investigations were underway. “Three Army personnel have already been arrested and handed over to the Court,” Dr. Jayatissa said.

The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA), Tamil National Alliance (TNA), and Ceylon Workers’ Congress (CWC) had declared their support for the hartal organised by the ITAK yesterday.
