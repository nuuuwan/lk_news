Inaugural National AI Expo and Conference kicks off next week

On 29 and 30 September the nation’s digital future will be on full display at the first-ever National AI Expo and Conference 2025 at Monarch Imperial, Colombo.

This is more than just an event; it’s a launchpad for the country’s AI movement, pioneered by the Digital Economy Ministry and SLT-Mobitel, opening the doors of AI and digitalisation to all of Sri Lanka, empowering individuals, businesses, and communities to explore, learn, and actively shape the nation’s digital future.

Under the theme “In Pursuit of AI”, the Expo will demonstrate how artificial intelligence is reshaping sectors such as agriculture, education, banking, finance, IT, healthcare, and manufacturing. Over two action-packed days, attendees can look forward to over 12 sessions, featuring more than 25 speakers and 25 exhibitors, all highlighting innovations that are driving Sri Lanka’s AI movement.

SLT Group Chairman Dr. Mothilal De Silva said: “SLT-Mobitel as Sri Lanka’s National ICT Solutions Provider, recognises the immense potential of artificial intelligence and it becomes our responsibility to drive the country’s digital future.”

He added: “Through the National AI Expo and Conference, we are committed to ensuring every Sri Lankan, from all communities, has the opportunity to participate and benefit from the AI revolution. It will be our legacy contribution to building a digitally inclusive and prosperous Sri Lanka, and we look forward to the active participation of all key stakeholders at the event next week and throughout this journey.”

The conference will bring together some of the brightest minds in technology and entrepreneurship. Participants will gain hands-on experience through workshops hosted by global tech leaders, including Huawei, Microsoft, TechOne Global, Universal College Lanka, and Webappclouds, providing practical insights into AI, machine learning, and generative AI applications.

The Expo will also feature a dynamic startup showcase, live exhibitions, and extensive networking opportunities that connect entrepreneurs, students, researchers, and investors, establishing it as a hub for innovation and collaboration.

At the Expo, SLT-Mobitel’s stall will provide immersive AI experiences, featuring AR and VR demonstrations across multiple AI zones. Visitors will have the opportunity to interact with practical applications of AI, experiencing firsthand how this technology is shaping industries and everyday life in Sri Lanka.

One of the highlights of the event is the Code Blast Hackathon Challenge 2025, powered by Mobitel, which invites young developers, startups, and tech enthusiasts to create real-world solutions using Mobitel’s mSpace platform. The initiative reflects a broader push to nurture innovation and equip the next generation of Sri Lankan technologists with the tools to make a real impact.
