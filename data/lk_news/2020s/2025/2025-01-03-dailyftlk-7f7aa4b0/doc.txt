Vehicle attack on pedestrians in New Orleans kills 14

14 people were killed and dozens injured when a man plowed into a crowd on Bourbon Street in a pickup truck, in New Orleans’ bustling French Quarter district early on New Year’s Day.

Shamsud-Din Jabbar, the suspect in the New Year’s Day attack in New Orleans acted alone, the FBI said Thursday, describing the deadly event as “an act of terrorism.”

Before the attack, the FBI says Jabbar posted videos online proclaiming his allegiance to the Islamic State group.

Investigators found guns and what appeared to be an improvised explosive device in the vehicle — which bore the flag of the Islamic State group — along with other explosive devices elsewhere in the French Quarter.

Wednesday’s attack unfolded on Bourbon Street, known worldwide as one of the largest destinations for New Year’s Eve parties. Large crowds also gathered in the city ahead of the College Football Playoff quarterfinal at the Sugar Bowl that had been scheduled for later Wednesday at the nearby Superdome. The game was postponed until Thursday afternoon following the attack.
