The notion of ‘female mentality’

Sri Lankan women are qualified. There is no dispute about it. They deserve equal footing in every sphere and must be given the same opportunities. If they can fly airplanes and serve in the armed forces against terrorists, they should have access to all positions in the country, whether in the public or private sector.

Last week, the media reported that the Government had decided to recruit women for various positions in Sri Lanka Railways and the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB), including railway guards and train drivers. By next year, the Government expects women to take on these roles, and the Transport Minister also spoke of plans to handover the country’s school bus service to women.

In 2025, Sri Lanka began allowing women to apply for railway station master posts after a fundamental rights petition led to a Supreme Court order to amend the relevant Gazette notice. Recruitment of women drivers and conductors for the SLTB was also set in motion to address staff shortages.

Two women challenged a June 2025 Gazette notification that limited applications for station master posts to men. In July, the Supreme Court granted leave to proceed, recognising gender-based exclusion as a breach of constitutional rights. By late August, the Attorney General’s Department informed the Court that the Gazette had been sent to the Cabinet for amendment to include women applicants.

In May 2025, the Minister of Transport announced that the SLTB would recruit women as drivers and conductors to fill staff gaps and strengthen the institution’s revenue. Media reports noted that these positions are being filled on a contract basis.

The authorities have taken the right step in handing over school buses to newly recruited female drivers and conductors. Women are best suited for the school bus service, as many are mothers or expect to become mothers in the future.

What remains is to challenge the social stigma attached to bus conductors. The role itself carries a poor image because conductors rarely assist passengers and generally treat them harshly, especially in private buses. Even in the SLTB, conductors have developed a bad reputation for refusing to accept season ticket holders and, when forced to do so, subjecting them to verbal harassment. Female conductors may therefore be welcomed by SLTB passengers. The authorities must ensure that new recruits are not influenced by the habits of male conductors already in service.

Research indicates that women are safer drivers than men. They are less likely to take risks, drink, or die on the roads. Statistics show men are more likely to cause accidents leading to injury and death.

Yet women face systemic barriers. Despite higher education levels, the “glass ceiling” keeps their presence low in senior management and board positions—12.5 percent and 8.2 percent respectively. Male-dominated sectors, such as logistics, make it difficult for women to move into leadership. Female labour force participation in Sri Lanka remains far lower than male participation and has declined over time, even with women achieving high educational standards.

In Sri Lanka, traditionally male-dominated fields include agriculture (ploughing and tilling), crafts, machine operations, construction, engineering, the logistics sector, and high-paying areas such as IT and finance. Women have entered some of these domains—law, medicine, and accountancy in particular—while efforts continue to increase their participation in sectors like engineering, maritime, and construction through training programmes and policies aimed at reducing gender-based barriers.

Women are also moving into industries not usually linked with them, such as automobile repair. Progress is visible in engineering, mechanics, and technical roles through targeted initiatives that open doors for greater involvement.

The notion of a ‘female mentality’ may refer to psychological and cognitive patterns commonly associated with women. These are shaped by culture and society, and vary widely among individuals. Traits such as holistic thinking, strong intuition, emotional processing, social awareness, and communication are often contrasted with the traits typically associated with men. Intuition, in particular, is sometimes described as a higher form of intelligence.

Some research suggests women tend to adopt a more holistic and intuitive approach to understanding concepts, while men may lean toward detail-oriented analysis. Traits such as empathy, expressiveness, and attentiveness to feelings are often associated with femininity, with some studies linking these capacities to the mirror neuron system. Women are also frequently described as more communicative and collaborative, with a strong drive for social connection and nurturing relationships.

These are among the qualities often seen in strong women. Sri Lanka is home to many such women, and they continue to drive significant changes in the country by recognising their role and value.
