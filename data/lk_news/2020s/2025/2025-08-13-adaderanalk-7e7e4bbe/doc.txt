Tamil Nadu fishermen strike in Rameswaram over frequent Sri Lanka Navy arrests

Rameswaram fishermen in Tamil Nadu have commenced an indefinite strike condemning frequent arrests by Sri Lanka Navy, according to India media reports.

A unanimous decision was reportedly taken by members at the Tamil Naduâ€™s All Mechanised Fishermen Consultation meeting.

Accordingly, over 700 mechanised boats remained anchored in fishing harbours in Rameswaram islet, demanding the Indian central government to secure release of fishers arrested by Sri Lanka.

Around 10,000 fishermen are taking part in the indefinite strike.

According to fishermen associations in Rameswaram, 61 fishers have been arrested by Sri Lankan navy since June 15. None of them has been released by the Sri Lankan government so far.

The fishers said the Indian central government must immediately start dialogue with Sri Lanka and secure the release of all the fishers along with their boats.

They also demanded that Katchatatheevu island must be taken back from Sri Lanka.

Further, fishermen have announced a protest in Thangachimadam today, hunger strike on August 15 and rail roko on August 19 to press for their demands.
