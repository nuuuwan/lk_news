The Science and Technology Ministry yesterday pledged full support to twin students from Anuradhapura who created an artificial intelligence-powered robot, noting the importance of nurturing young innovators and linking them to research and commercialisation opportunities.

Science and Technology Minister Prof. Chrishantha Abeysena, met with Sasiru Nimnal and Ramiru Nimnath, twin students of Vidyadeepa Maha Vidyalaya in Katukeliyawa, to appreciate their creation, a humanoid robot developed using AI and robotics technology.

The meeting, held at the Ministry yesterday, explored ways the Ministry can support further development of the robot and the students’ future innovations.

Addressing the gathering, Prof. Abeysena said, “No new invention should be abandoned. We are ready to provide all necessary support for the development of this creation and for other talented students across the country.”

He highlighted plans to establish 100 school innovation clubs this year, which will gradually expand across the entire school system, aiming to connect young innovators with universities, research facilities and commercialisation pathways.

Representatives from the Arthur C. Clarke Institute, the Inventors Commission, and the National Innovation Agency expressed readiness to provide technical guidance and assist in securing patent rights for the students’ robot.

The twins revealed their ambition to further develop the humanoid robot into a tourist guide, showcasing how AI can be applied to practical, real-world challenges.
