Sri Lanka Trump tariff shock too early to assess: CB Governor

ECONOMYNEXT – The shock to Sri Lanka from a Trump tariff is too early to assess, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said, though slower global due from the fallout has been factored in to macro-economic projections.

“What we do not know is if there is a shock to the economy,” Governor Weerasinghe said earlier this week.

It was too early to predict whether there would be employment losses, he said.

Sri Lanka has reduced its 44 percent Trump tariff to 30 percent is negotiating to bring it down further to ensure that competing countries do not have lower rates.

The International Monetary Fund has said gross domestic product could be hit between 0.25-1.5 percent depending on what the rate was. (Colombo/July13/2025)
