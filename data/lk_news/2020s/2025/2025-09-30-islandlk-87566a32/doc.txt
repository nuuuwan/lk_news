Mahindra Ideal Finance Ltd. (MIFL), one of Sri Lanka’s fastest-growing non-bank financial institutions, has further expanded its island-wide presence with the opening of a new branch in Gampola on 18 September 2025. This marks the company’s 37th branch and reflects its continued commitment to improving access to financial services across the Central Province and beyond.

MIFL’s Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Mufaddal Choonia, led the opening ceremony, together with members of the company’s senior management and branch staff. The new branch offers a full portfolio of services, including multi-brand Vehicle Leasing, Business & SME Loans, Revolving Loans, Gold Loans and Fixed Deposits, aimed at supporting both individual and business customers in the area.

“Our expansion into Gampola is part of a broader effort to bring customised, transparent and flexible financial solutions closer to where our customers live and work. We believe every Sri Lankan should have access to tools that help them build a better future for themselves, regardless of geography.”

The Gampola branch adds to MIFL’s growing regional network, which plays a central role in the company’s strategy to extend responsible and technology-enabled finance to emerging communities in Sri Lanka.
