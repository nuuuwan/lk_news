Court issues notice to Rajitha to appear on 29 August

The Colombo Chief Magistrateâ€™s Court yesterday issued a formal notice to former Minister Rajitha Senaratne, instructing him to appear before the Court on 29 August in connection with a case filed by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC).

The notice was issued by Chief Magistrate Tanuja Lakmali Jayatunga, under Section 60(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, following a review of the complaint submitted by the Bribery Commission.

On Tuesday, the Colombo Chief Magistrate rejected a request made by the former Minister to temporarily suspend the arrest warrant issued against him.

The warrant was issued on 12 August by Additional Magistrate Pasan Amarasinghe, in connection with an investigation into a sand mining project at the Kirinda Fisheries Harbour, allegedly awarded to a Korean company, resulting in a loss exceeding Rs. 20 million to the Government.
