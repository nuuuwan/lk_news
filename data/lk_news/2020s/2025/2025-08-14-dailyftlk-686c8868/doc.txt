Colombo Dockyard PLC (CDPLC) recently delivered the eighth vessel in the 5000 DWT Eco Bulk Carrier series, named “Misje Lily,” to Misje Eco Bulk AS of Norway, marking another milestone in this successful long-term collaboration.

Following the handover of the first vessel in September 2022, CDPLC has continued to deliver each ship in the series with increasing efficiency. The completion of Misje Lily once again demonstrates Colombo Dockyard’s ability to meet international standards.

The 89.95m DNV-classed Eco Bulker was conceptualised by Wartsila Ship Design Norway, with detailed design work carried out by CDPLC’s skilled in-house design team. In line with the latest trends in sustainable shipping, the vessel is equipped with an advanced Energy Storage Battery System (ESS) for Electric Hybrid Propulsion, complementing the conventional diesel propulsion system to enhance operational performance and reduce environmental impact.

The successful delivery of Misje Lily reaffirms Colombo Dockyard’s reputation as a reliable builder of high-quality, eco-friendly vessels for discerning global clients.
