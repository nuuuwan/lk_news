India sends Bailey bridge units and team to aid recovery efforts

An Indian Air Force C-17 arrived in Sri Lanka yesterday with modular Bailey bridge components and a 25-member team to support recovery work following the floods and landslides.

The shipment includes a 110-foot two-lane bridge that can be deployed immediately, additional modular sections for multiple sites, and five dinghy boats for transport and rescue operations. Engineers trained in rapid bridge installation and medical staff are part of the contingent.

Officials said the equipment will be used to restore access to areas cut off after bridge failures, allowing supplies and relief services to reach affected communities. Authorities welcomed the assistance, noting that reconnecting isolated areas remains one of the most urgent challenges in the disaster response.
