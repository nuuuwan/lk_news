When Women Lead, Nations Change: Sri Lanka’s Unfinished Journey

“I am the first to enter politics from here, and my brothers and sisters will undoubtedly follow,” said Ambika Samuel, the first Malayaha woman elected to Sri Lanka’s parliament. With not an ounce of political lineage behind her, the daughter of plantation worker parents, paved her way up through determination and social activism. She faced a myriad of challenges from language barriers to social marginalisation, yet proved that women’s political leadership can be achieved, through dedication, vision, and a deep commitment to service. Is Ambika’s success an exceptional rare breakthrough or is it one of the many journeys every woman takes to become a leader of her own? I will explore our answer to this question with the anecdotes of similar rebels, and the literature published by various organisations that have given power for the women’s voice to be heard in the political network of Sri Lanka.

Women make up over 56% of registered voters, yet they accounted for barely 5% of legislators in parliament between 2020 and 2024. Sri Lanka’s Gender Inequality Index took a hit in 2024, worsening from 93 to 122, thanks to low political representation of women, triggering alarm bells of stagnating gender equity gains. The upside? In 2025, the index started to bounce back, indicating modest progress in women’s political representation and gender equality at large. Similarly, the 25% quota for women in local government which Sri Lanka established in 2017 has not brought meaningful change according to gender activists who view it as a symbolic measure. The activists argue that political parties would have run with no female candidates or very few candidates if quotas did not exist because men have traditionally controlled these parties and continue to block women from entering politics. Equity alone isn’t enough, without women actively in politics. Their concerns risk being overlooked in the halls of power.

According to the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES), women in Sri Lanka continue to face systemic barriers to political participation due to the structure of the electoral system and broader social dynamics. The research shows that women running for office face multiple obstacles because of voting systems, funding shortages, media restrictions and violence against women in elections (VAWE).

The process of campaigning for national office requires candidates to visit extensive electoral areas which becomes extremely difficult for female candidates who lack sufficient financial resources. The 2009 Inter-Parliamentary Union survey of women parliamentarians and the 2013 UN Women study show that financial constraints remain the primary obstacle for women to run for political office or seek election.

Media functions as a key element which determines how women politicians become visible to the public. The platform enables candidates to reach voters yet Sri Lankan women face barriers when it comes to receiving substantial media attention about national security and economic and political matters. Their inability to be seen in the public eye damages their ability to make important decisions.

The practice of VAWE represents a significant obstacle to democratic advancement. The 2018 and 2019, IFES evaluations showed that VAWE occurred throughout the 2018 local government elections in both digital and physical spaces.

These difficulties are demonstrated by the experience of a former female provincial councilor. “My friend and I were the only women in a hall full of more than 100 men,” she recalled. She begged party leaders to nominate at least one female candidate, but her request was denied, and as a result, that party did not field any women in the 2020 parliamentary election. In order to achieve true gender equality in political representation, systemic changes are required, as this case shows that quotas by themselves are insufficient to overcome long-standing male dominance in party politics. Similar trends have also been noted outside of Sri Lanka, such as in Indonesia, where party structures have continued to restrict women’s influence despite legal candidate quotas increasing their presence.

The implementation of gender quotas represents an essential starting point, but it fails to achieve complete transformation of political representation. The shift from domestic responsibilities to political leadership demands more than mere relocation because their participation needs to be backed by training programmes, local community involvement, and political experience (Krook, 2010; Dahlerup, 2006). The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) indicates that women who want to become political leaders need to dedicate multiple years to establishing credibility and party connections through community work and educational and mentoring programmes.

The UNFPA predicts that women will maintain their political careers through supportive systems which include childcare facilities and flexible work arrangements; political parties need to create gender-sensitive organisational systems, which should include balanced candidate selection methods, mentoring initiatives, and safety measures against harassment and electoral violence.

The media along with public awareness initiatives fight stereotypes that restrict women to household duties to establish their right to participate in decision-making processes. The transformation of quotas into lasting political engagement tools requires eliminating every obstacle that exists within structural frameworks and cultural systems and systemic structures. Sri Lanka has achieved some advancement in political gender equality yet various persistent challenges remain.

The stories of leaders like Ambika Samuel show that women’s political breakthroughs are possible, but they remain the exception rather than the norm. The 25% quota for local government representation has not led to substantial changes in female participation because political parties continue to control the system and women face resource shortages, media bias, and electoral violence.

Systemic reforms need to replace quotas in order to establish enduring changes. Women leaders who hold political positions need proper training, support systems, and recognition to maintain their leadership positions. Political parties need to establish gender-sensitive practices which include open nomination processes, mentoring systems, and harassment prevention measures. The success of women in politics depends on structural measures which include childcare facilities, flexible work arrangements, and targeted training programmes to support their domestic duties.

The transformation of social views about women will occur through media campaigns, grassroots activism, and civic education programmes which will establish them as voters and decision-makers. The path to real equality requires specific policies along with sustained dedication over time. The country of Sri Lanka will achieve full democratic change through women leaders only when they gain actual power rather than holding ceremonial roles.
