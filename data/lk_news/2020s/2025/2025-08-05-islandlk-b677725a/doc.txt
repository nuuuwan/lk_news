‘The First Fools’ who saw Singapore through to independence

In a bold and timely release marking Singapore’s 60th year of independence, a new book is shaking up the familiar narrative of nation-building by offering a surprising and deeply human portrait of the men behind the republic’s birth. ‘The First Fools: B-Sides of Lee Kuan Yew’s A-Team’ is a literary excavation of the 10 men who signed the 1965 Separation Agreement, offering fresh insight into their lives beyond the headlines and history books.

Published by The Nutgraf — a boutique editorial studio run largely by former journalists — the anthology is not a typical commemorative volume. Instead of celebrating political milestones and statecraft, it uncovers the untold personal stories of Singapore’s founding fathers: their hobbies, love lives, eccentricities, and even secret pasts.

Speaking exclusively to The Island Financial Review, Peh Shing Huei, Editor of the book, said the team set out to produce something unlike anything already on the shelves. “There are already countless books and documentaries detailing their political legacies — their policies, speeches, and public service. But what about who they were as people? Their B-sides, so to speak?”

That question led to ‘The First Fools’, a title intentionally playful and irreverent, mirroring the tone of a book that dares to show Lee Kuan Yew as “the lover,” Jek Yeun Thong as a “crypto-communist,” and Othman Wok as a “ghost story writer.”

In perhaps the most unexpected chapter, founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew is depicted not as the unyielding architect of modern Singapore, but as a man profoundly and singularly devoted to his wife, Kwa Geok Choo.

“We were very conscious not to romanticize unnecessarily, Huei told The Island Financial Review. “But there was something so moving and consistent in every account we heard — that for all his steely pragmatism, Lee had this deep, unwavering love.”

The authors interviewed Philip Yeo, a former senior civil servant who served as Lee’s Special Advisor for Economic Development. His comment was both humorous and poignant: “A teapot has many teacups, just like an emperor has many concubines. But Lee Kuan Yew had only one teacup.”

Their love story, including a secret marriage while studying in England, is rendered with tenderness and surprising intimacy. “Kwa was more than a spouse — she was his confidante, his emotional compass,” said Huei. “She helped him see people clearly, and often softened his more authoritarian impulses.”

One of the most memorable anecdotes in the book is about a “missing photo” of Kwa combing Lee’s hair — a moment captured by Straits Times photographer George Gascon but mysteriously absent from the public record. The image, like the relationship it portrays, remains elusive yet resonant.

The First Fools follows ‘The Last Fools’, a 2022 release by The Nutgraf that profiled eight lesser-known civil servants from Lee Kuan Yew’s inner circle. Where the earlier book explored the “A-sides” of obscure figures, ‘The First Fools’ presents the “B-sides” of famous ones.

“These men signed the document that made Singapore an independent nation,” said Huei. “But they also lived, loved, wrote, joked, doubted, and dreamed. That’s what we wanted to show. And we hope their stories resonate not just in Singapore but also in Sri Lanka and the wider region, where questions of identity, leadership, and legacy are just as urgent.”
