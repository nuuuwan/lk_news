# Supplying T-56 ammo to ‘Commando Salintha’: Palinagar Army Camp CO Arrested

The Commanding Officer of the Army camp in Palinagar, a Lieutenant Colonel, has been arrested by the Western Province North Police Crimes Division for allegedly supplying 260 rounds of ammunition for T-56 rifles to an underworld figure known as ‘Commando Salintha’.

The ammunition, reportedly sold for Rs 650,000, was linked to criminal activities by Salintha, who was recently apprehended in Jakarta, Indonesia. The Army officer is currently in the custody of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).

Police said the Lieutenant Colonel, while serving as the Commanding Officer in Palinagar, supplied the ammunition in two batches—200 rounds and 60 rounds—and received the payment in return.

Reports indicate that the officer had previously served at the Commando Regiment Headquarters in Ganemulla in 2017, where ‘Commando Salintha’ had been under his command. He was later transferred to the Light Infantry Regiment following a disciplinary issue.

In a related development, a Sub-Inspector of Police attached to the Gampaha Division’s Crime Investigation Unit has also been arrested on suspicion of maintaining close ties with ‘Kehelbaddara Padme’, a known member of an organised criminal gang. ASP F.U. Wootler, Police Media Spokesman, confirmed that the Sub-Inspector was taken into CID custody.

These arrests follow the recent extradition of ‘Kehelbaddara Padme’ and four other gang members from Indonesia. Interrogations of those suspects led the CID and the Western Province North Range Crimes Division to identify both the Lieutenant Colonel and the Sub-Inspector as connected to the underworld network.

Meanwhile, Public Security Minister Ananda Wijepala informed Parliament on the same day that a total of 15 Sri Lankan underworld figures with Interpol Red Notices issued against them are currently in custody abroad, including in Russia, Oman, India, and the UAE. The Minister stated that these individuals would be repatriated to Sri Lanka once security clearances are completed in the respective countries.
