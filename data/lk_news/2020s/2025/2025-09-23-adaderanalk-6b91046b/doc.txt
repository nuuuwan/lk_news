The owner of a lorry that was found concealing heroin and crystal methamphetamine (commonly known as ‘Ice’) in Seenimodara, Tangalle, yesterday (22), has been ordered to be detained for questioning.

Mount Lavinia Magistrate Pasan Amarasena issued the order to allow the Mount Lavinia Police to question the suspect in connection with the discovery of a large haul of narcotics.

The lorry was discovered by police near a house in Seenimodara, Tangalle, where the bodies of two men had previously been recovered. The narcotics were found hidden near the property.
