Sri Lanka approves over 62,000 state jobs in last eight months: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has approved 62,314 state sector jobs in the last eight months under the new government, Cabinet Spokesman and Media Minister Nalinda Jayatissa said.

“In the last eight months, 62,314 cadre positions have been approved to be recruited to state services,” he told reporters at the weekly Cabinet media briefing in Colombo on Tuesday.

“Some have already been recruited. For some the exams are being held and for some others, the interviews are going on.”

The new government’s recruitment drive comes against the last government’s move to shrink state sector jobs to reduce the budget deficit.

However, Minister Jayatissa justified the move saying that the approval came due to vacancies existing in several ministries.

He said approval had been given for the Defence Ministry to fill 12,433 cadre positions while 11,888 state jobs including government medical officers were approved for Media and Health Ministries. (Colombo/August 12/2025)
