President nominates Justice Surasena for Chief Justice post: Cabinet Spokesman

Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa yesterday confirmed that President Anura Kumara Disanayake has nominated Justice Preethi Padman Surasena for the position of Chief Justice and submitted his name to the Constitutional Council for approval.

“Yes, the President has submitted Preethi Padman Surasena’s name to the Constitutional Council as Chief Justice,” Dr. Jayatissa stated, responding to a question at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing.

Commenting on the decision, the Cabinet Spokesman said Justice Surasena is a senior judge of the Supreme Court with a long and respected career in the judiciary. “That’s why the President submitted his name,” he added, addressing questions about overlooking seniority.

Surasena was the Committee Chair appointed by Parliament to investigate allegations of gross abuse of power against suspended Inspector General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Thennakoon.
