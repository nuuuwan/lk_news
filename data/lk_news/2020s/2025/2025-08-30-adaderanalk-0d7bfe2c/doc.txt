Criminal gang leaders including ‘Kehelbaddara Padme’ to be brought to Sri Lanka today

Five high-profile underworld figures, including ‘Kehelbaddara Padme’, who were arrested in Indonesia, are scheduled to be brought back to the island this evening (30), according to Sri Lanka Police.

A special police team from Sri Lanka was dispatched to Indonesia this morning to facilitate their return. The team has reportedly taken the criminal gang members into their custody from the Indonesia authorities and is now bringing them back to the island.

According to reports, the special police team accompanying the arrested suspects are currently en route to Sri Lanka from Jakarta.

Notorious organised criminal Mandinu Padmasiri, alias ‘Kehelbaddara Padme’, and gang members known by the aliases ‘Commando Salintha’, ‘Backhoe Saman’, ‘Thembili Lahiru’ and Kudu Nilantha, were arrested in Jakarta recently, and a woman and a small child who were with them were also taken into custody.

However, Indonesian authorities had deported the woman and child back to the island last evening since no serious criminal charges have been filed against the woman.

The suspects were apprehended during a joint special operation conducted by a special team of Sri Lanka Police in collaboration with the Jakarta Police and with the assistance of INTERPOL.
