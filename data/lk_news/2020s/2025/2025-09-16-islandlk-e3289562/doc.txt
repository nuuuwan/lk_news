Sun Siyam Pasikudah’s New Chapter

As with all Sun Siyam properties, Sun Siyam Care, the group’s sustainability arm, is deeply embedded in Pasikudah. Every booking supports marine conservation projects, with special attention here to the fragile bay ecosystem. Coral restoration efforts, beach clean-ups, and community education programs are part of the resort’s daily rhythm.

The resort works closely with local farmers and fishermen, sourcing produce and seafood responsibly to minimize its footprint while strengthening livelihoods. Guests are invited to visit nearby communities, offering a more authentic perspective on Sri Lankan life beyond the resort walls. In a region still rebuilding from the scars of conflict and natural disasters, Pasikudah’s presence carries a promise: that tourism can be a force for good when guided by care.

While the Maldives may be Sun Siyam’s birthplace, Pasikudah represents the brand’s expansion of spirit. Group CEO Deepak Booneady calls the transformation “not just about design, but about cultural authenticity and purpose-driven hospitality.”

For Pasikudah, that authenticity is distinctly Sri Lankan. As the only Sun Siyam property outside the Maldives, it holds a dual identity, an ambassador for the group’s ethos, and a showcase of Sri Lanka’s own hospitality heritage. It signals to the world that the eastern coast is ready for travelers seeking stories, not just stays.

Luxury here is not about excess, but about connection to people, to culture, and to place. It’s an invitation to slow down, to listen to the ocean’s whispers, and to carry a piece of Sri Lanka home with you.

In the words of its founder, Ahmed Siyam Mohamed: “Our goal was always to share the warmth of our islands and our people with the world.” In Pasikudah, that goal finds a new home, one where Sri Lanka’s own spirit dances alongside Maldivian soul.
