Rs. 2 billion private sector leisure and real estate investment in Pinnawela

Marking a major milestone for both the hospitality industry and the regional economy, construction has already commenced on Elephant Vast Resort — the first luxury boutique apartment-cum-hotel complex in the Pinnawela area.

The project represents an investment exceeding Rs. 2 billion, making it the largest private sector leisure and real estate investment in the region.

The main investor, Dr. H. Ratnayake, has allocated a 14.5-acre site for the development and has already invested approximately Rs. 300 million to initiate construction.

Project Consultant and Chairman of Ariel Assets Real Estate Development Strategies, Architect Ranga Soysa, said the first set of apartments is expected to be completed by the end of next year.

“Although many tourists visit Pinnawela, only a few stay overnight. Our goal is to increase guest stays to around seven nights through them introduction of traditional wellness and rejuvenation packages, he told the media.

The project will feature three categories of single-block luxury homes, which can be purchased outright or leased to guests opting for wellness packages.

The Pinnawela development will also include 60 villas and a 30-room boutique hotel, offering a blend of modern luxury and eco-friendly design.

Soysa added that the team plans to replicate similar projects in Thalpe, Hewaheta, Bolgoda and Panama, with a total investment of around Rs. 8 billion by 2030, adding approximately 150 more villas and hotel rooms. The total direct employment generation across all projects is estimated at around 700.

Marketing efforts for the first project have already begun in partnership with Dr. Prem Jagyasi, a Chartered Consultant in Medical Tourism, Wellness, and Global Healthcare based in India, as well as through a UAE-based real estate company.

“We have already sold about 30 apartments, including 12 purchased by foreign investors, Soysa noted.

In addition to promoting tourism, the project aims to bring economic benefits to surrounding rural communities. The team plans to host a series of cultural events to revive Sri Lanka’s traditional arts and folk dances.

“The first cultural event was held at the Fort Railway Station on Sunday, featuring traditional performances, Soysa said. “We plan to host more events in Galle Fort, Ella and Dambulla, culminating in a major cultural festival at Ambuluwawa next August, he added.
