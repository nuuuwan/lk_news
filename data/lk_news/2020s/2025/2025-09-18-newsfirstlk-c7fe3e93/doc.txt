Sri Lanka Plans To Ban Corporal Punishment

COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lanka is set to revolutionize its justice system with the rollout of child witness rooms in 50 courts nationwide, marking a major step toward making legal processes more child-friendly and trauma-sensitive. The announcement was made by Minister of Justice Harshana Nanayakkara, during the opening of the country’s first-ever child witness room at the Kandy High Court.“This is a turning point for Sri Lanka’s justice system,” Minister Nanayakkara declared.“Children will now have a voice in courts without fear—protected by law, supported by technology, and treated with dignity.”The new facilities, equipped with modern audio-visual technology, allow children to testify from a separate room within the court premises, shielding them from direct confrontation with perpetrators and minimizing psychological harm.The initiative is part of a broader reform agenda under the Child Protection and Justice Bill, which aims to embed the principle of the best interest of the child at every stage of the legal process. The bill will also introduce legal provisions for case conferences, case management, and diversion mechanisms to steer children away from the criminal justice system.Minister Nanayakkara also confirmed that legal reforms to prohibit corporal punishment have already reached Parliament, aligning with Sri Lanka’s commitment to child rights and international standards.“In line with the government’s digitisation vision and the judiciary’s commitment to modernizing court systems, we are proud to see these child-friendly facilities begin to take shape,” he said.The Ministry of Justice plans to expand these facilities to 15 more high courts initially, followed by 35 additional courts, ensuring national coverage and access to child-sensitive justice.
