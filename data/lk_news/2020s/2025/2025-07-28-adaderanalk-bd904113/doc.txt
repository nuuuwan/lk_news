Trump says he is setting new 10 to 12-day deadline for Russia on war

U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday increased pressure on Russia to end its war in Ukraine, saying he was setting a new deadline of 10 to 12 days for Moscow to make progress on doing so.

Trump, who is holding meetings in Scotland, said earlier on Monday that he was going to shorten a 50-day deadline he had set because of frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
