Knuckles Spring Water enters Bahrain market

The Embassy of Sri Lanka in the Kingdom of Bahrain actively facilitated the entry of Knuckles Spring Water, produced by Sri Lankan corporate Cargills (Ceylon) PLC, into the Bahraini market. This marks the first time Cargills-manufactured products have been introduced to Bahrain.

Sourced from the pristine Knuckles Mountain Range in Sri Lanka, Knuckles Spring Water is bottled at the source to preserve its purity and natural mineral content. It is available in both glass and PET bottles and will be distributed through the renowned Al Jazira Supermarket chain across Bahrain.

A standout feature of the product is the inclusion of Braille lettering on the glass bottles—an important accessibility feature that enables visually impaired consumers to identify the product, underscoring the commitment to inclusivity.

This market entry is part of the Sri Lanka Embassy’s ongoing efforts to promote value-added Sri Lankan products and to build strong brand recognition for Sri Lanka in Bahrain in line with its broader economic diplomacy objectives.
