Blackout at Sri Lanka court during ex-President’s bail hearing

ECONOMYNEXT – A blackout occurred at the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court during the bail hearing of ex-President Ranil Wickremesinghe, a court reporter said.

Wickremesinghe was brought to court after being arrested in the afternoon following a questioning.

The bail hearing went on for hours with the court eventually taking a 30 minute recess.

Lights then went out plunging the premises packed with officials, media and supporters into darkness.

Wickremesinghe was asked earlier in the proceedings to step into the suspect’s cage, eliciting a loud gasp from people gathered outside.

His arrest was over the use of state funds for a stop-over in London while returning from a foreign visit while he was president.

Wickremesinghe became acting president following the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on July 15, 2022.

Days later parliament elected him as the 8th Executive President of the country, during the worst economic crisis of its post-independence history.

He is credited for steering the island nation towards recovery.

He served until Anura Disanayake was elected president on September 21, 2024. (Colombo/Aug22/2025)
