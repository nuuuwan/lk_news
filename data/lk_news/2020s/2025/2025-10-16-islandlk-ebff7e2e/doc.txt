Sri Lanka gears up to host 9th International Boat Show & Conference

From January 30 to February 1, 2026, the island nation will welcome the world to Boat Show & Conference 2026, South Asia’s premier marine festival. Held at the spectacular Port City Colombo and open daily from 3:00 PM to 10:00 PM, the event promises to be the biggest and most dynamic edition in its history.

Organized by the Chamber of Marine Industries Sri Lanka and managed by CDC Events (Pvt) Ltd, the show is backed by the Ministries of Industry and Entrepreneurship, Foreign Affairs, Employment and Tourism, and the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB). This strong endorsement underscores Sri Lanka’s ambition to become a regional hub for boating, yachting, marine tourism, and boat and ship building.

A Regional Success Story — Since its launch in 2008, the Boat & Marine Show has grown from a niche exhibition into South Asia’s largest marine showcase promoting boating as a lifestyle, drawing global buyers, investors, and enthusiasts. Previous editions in 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2023 set the stage for an even grander 2026 edition.

What’s on Display — This year’s event will feature: Boats, yachts, and ship builders from Sri Lanka and abroad; Marine engines, repairs, navigation systems and composite materials; Diving operators, water sports providers, and eco-tourism ventures; Yacht brokers, marinas, and charter services; Whale and dolphin watching operators. The mix of trade and entertainment ensures the show appeals to both industry leaders and the public.

Global Participation — Delegations from India, Singapore, Maldives, South Korea, Belgium, Germany, Holland, the UK, Seychelles, and the Middle East are expected, giving exhibitors unparalleled access to international buyers and decision-makers. Participants will include investors exploring joint ventures in marine industries; hotels, resorts, and tour operators; navy, coast guard, and port authorities; adventure clubs, yachting associations, and high-net-worth individuals.

Backed by Government, Powered by Industry — The Sri Lankan government has identified the show as a priority event for promoting exports, investment, and tourism. For exhibitors, this translates into credibility and visibility; for buyers, it signals a stable, investor-friendly environment.

More Than a Boat Show — Boat & Marine Show 2026 is not only an exhibition but a celebration of marine lifestyle and culture. It combines business networking with entertainment, creating opportunities for trade, partnerships, and leisure in the heart of Colombo.

The first day will host a conference spotlighting Sri Lanka’s rich nautical tourism potential and the need to safeguard its marine ecosystems.
