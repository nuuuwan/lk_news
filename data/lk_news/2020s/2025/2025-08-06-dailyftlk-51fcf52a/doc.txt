New delimitation committee appointed to update administrative divisions

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the appointment of a new delimitation committee to review and update administrative boundaries for Divisional Secretariat (DS) divisions and Grama Niladhari (GN) divisions.

The decision comes after limited progress on the work of two earlier committees. The first, appointed in 2012, made several recommendations, but only some were implemented. A second committee, reappointed in 2021, saw none of its proposals acted upon.

“Under the new mandate, the committee will seek feedback on both previous reports from Divisional Coordination Committees and District Coordination Committees,” Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

He said after reviewing this input, the Committee will prepare a fresh set of recommendations for the Government.

Dr. Jayatissa noted that the updated delimitation process is intended to address population shifts, ensure fair representation, and improve the efficiency of public administration across the country.
