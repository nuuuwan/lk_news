The event will be attended by prominent figures from the Ministry of Ports & Civil Aviation, government authorities, trade organizations and leading maritime companies, reflecting the integral role of SLANA in advancing national shipping policies and fostering industry development.

SLANA’s mission to safeguard the interests of NVOCC agents and promote the maritime sector aligns with the larger vision of enhancing Sri Lanka’s position as a key player in global and regional trade. Events like the SLANA Sixes help reinforce these efforts by strengthening bonds within the industry and encouraging collective growth.

The SLANA Sixes 2025 promises a thrilling day of cricket, camaraderie and celebration of the maritime industry’s invaluable contributions to Sri Lanka’s economy.
