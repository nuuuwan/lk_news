Pagariya JBN Power Conclave showcases global business leadership in Colombo

The Pagariya JBN Power Conclave, an exclusive international summit for JITO’s Chief Patrons (CPs) and leading Jain business leaders, was held from 15 to 17 August at the ITC Ratnadipa in Colombo.

Hosted by JBN Apex and JITO Chennai Plus Chapter, the 2.5-day conclave brought together over 600 influential entrepreneurs, investors, and thought leaders from India and across the globe. The gathering was designed to enable high-level networking, sectoral collaboration, and new business opportunities, while also offering a platform for knowledge-sharing through keynote addresses, fireside conversations, and curated business dialogues.

Adding to the star power and thought leadership of the conclave were several distinguished guests. Bollywood superstars Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgn made special appearances, while prominent Indian leaders such as Union Minister Smriti Irani and Dr. Shashi Tharoor participated in engaging sessions, lending both political and cultural gravitas to the event. Their presence underscored the conclave’s unique ability to blend business, leadership, and inspiration.

Sri Lanka’s investment potential took center stage with dedicated sessions led by the Board of Investment (BOI), Brandix Lanka’s Alok Malhotra, and Thilan Wijesinghe of TWC, who highlighted opportunities for trade, collaboration, and innovation. These presentations enabled Sri Lankan business leaders to directly engage with the influential JBN network and explore prospects for cross-border partnerships.

The Indo-Lanka Chamber of Commerce & Industry (ILCCI) affiliated to The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce worked alongside JITO and the local organisers to support this momentous occasion, which not only highlighted Colombo as a destination for international business gatherings but also underscored the growing importance of India–Sri Lanka economic cooperation.
