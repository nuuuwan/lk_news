Fonterra sells most downstream businesses including in Sri Lanka to Lactalis

ECONOMYNEXT – New Zealand’s Fonterra said it had agreed to sell most of its consumer, ingredients and foodservice businesses including in Sri Lanka to France based Lactalis for 3.845 billion New Zealand dollars.

“The sale comprises Fonterra’s global Consumer business (excluding Greater China) and Consumer brands; the integrated Foodservice and Ingredients businesses in Oceania and Sri Lanka; and the Middle East and Africa Foodservice business,” the dairy co-operative said in a statement.

Also pending was further talks to included Bega brands in Australia which could add another 375 million dollars to the deal.

“As the world’s largest dairy company, Lactalis has the scale required to take these brands and businesses to the next level,” Fonterra CEO Miles Hurrell said in a statement.

“Fonterra farmers will continue to benefit from their success, with Lactalis to become one of our most significant Ingredients customers.”

The sale to another company was faster than an initial public offering, Fonterra board chairman Peter McBride said.

“Following a highly competitive sale process with multiple interested bidders, the Fonterra Board is confident a sale to Lactalis is the highest value option for the Co-op, including over the long-term.

“Alongside a strong valuation for the businesses being divested, the sale allows for a full divestment of the assets by Fonterra, and a faster return of capital to the Co-op’s owners, when compared with an IPO.

Lactalis is a France-based family business founded in 1933, has a presence in 50 countries and also acquired the Kraft brand in the US and Canada.  (Colombo/Aug22/2025)
