Ramadia Grand fills luxury void as Moratuwa – Panadura’s first four-star hotel

The Moratuwa–Panadura region has welcomed its first four-star hotel with the opening of Ramadia Grand, a landmark development by the Rodesha Group aimed at filling a longstanding void in high-end hospitality infrastructure.

The 11-story property features 50 luxury rooms, including five suites, and the area’s only rooftop swimming pool. It also houses the largest pillarless banquet hall in the region, accommodating over 1,500 guests, alongside three additional MICE-ready venues.

Chairman Rohan Fernando emphasised the hotel’s role in attracting long-stay foreign travelers and positioning Moratuwa as a premium destination. “This hotel is more than just a luxury property – it’s a catalyst for regional tourism,” he said.

With curated excursions, lagoon-side yacht dining, and over 160 new jobs created, Ramadia Grand has already drawn strong international interest and forward bookings, signaling a new chapter for the region’s tourism potential.
